They booed. ### Describing golf as ""my primary form of exercise"", Trump tweeted: ""The weather is beautiful, and this place is incredible! Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin."" ### DONALD AND VLADIMIR ### Putin held several meetings in the Kremlin, including talks with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. The Russian leader was due to attend the opera at the Bolshoi Theatre later and will watch the final of the soccer World Cup in Moscow on Sunday. ### Trump and Putin, who control the world's two biggest nuclear arsenals, are due to meet in the Finnish capital, a venue that evokes memories of Cold War showdowns between the Soviet Union and the United States. ### Trump, a 72-year-old former New York real estate developer who praises his own deal-making skills, and Putin, a 65-year-old former KGB spy who cultivates a macho image as a man of action, are due to have some time alone at the summit. ### In the most detailed U.S. accusation to date that Moscow meddled in the presidential election, a federal grand jury said Russian military intelligence agency officers covertly monitored computers of Clinton's campaign and Democratic campaign committees, and stole large amounts of data. ### The charges shine an even brighter spotlight on Trump's treatment of Putin, who has repeatedly denied that Russia sought to skew the election that Trump, a Republican, unexpectedly won. ### U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking to reporters before his departure to Helsinki on Sunday, pushed back at Democrats who called for the summit to be cancelled. ### ""I am confident that President Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin will put America in a better place. I think it's very important that they meet,"" he told reporters en route from Mexico on Friday, in remarks embargoed until Saturday. ### ""DEEP STATE?"" ### Trump questioned why Barack Obama had not acted on claims of Russian meddling if the FBI had informed the then president ahead of the 2016 election. He also asked where the Democratic National Committee server now was. ### ""Why didn’t the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?"" Trump asked on Twitter. ### When asked at a news conference on Friday whether he would tell Putin to stay out of U.S. elections, Trump said ""Yes"". ### The president also indicated he did not expect much progress on the issue. ""I will absolutely bring that up,"" Trump told reporters. ""I don’t think you’ll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.'"" ### After tens of thousands of people marched peacefully against Trump in central London on Friday, a few thousand protested in the Scottish capital, Edinburgh, were a blimp depicting Trump as an orange, snarling baby was raised. ### A Greenpeace activist swooped on a powered parachute within a few hundred yards of the president as he stood outside the golf course's hotel on Friday evening. Trump moved inside calmly as the parachute approached, surrounded by his security detail. ### British Trade Secretary Liam Fox said anti-Trump protesters were an embarrassment to themselves as they had shown bad manners to the leader of the free world. ### Around 100 supporters of Trump, some wearing ""Make Britain Great Again"" hats, expressed their admiration for the president opposite the U.S. embassy in London. ### (Additional reporting by James Davey, Alex Fraser and Michael Holden in London and Henry Nicholls in Turnberry, Scotland, and Maria Kiselyova in Moscow; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Mark Potter and Kevin Liffey) ### Advertisement"

Endless media hype. Huge ratings. ### Although President Donald Trump has met with Russia's Vladimir Putin twice before, he is eager to recreate in Finland the heady experience that he had last month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore: a summit that became a mass media event complete with powerful presidential images. Ever the showman and insistent on establishing closer ties to Moscow, Trump overruled his advisers and demanded the rituals and pageantry of a formal summit. ### Trump had boasted to confidants about the number of cameras in Singapore, claiming it dwarfed coverage of the Oscars, according to a person familiar with his thinking but not authorized to discuss private conversations and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Though Trump originally expressed concern that Helsinki was not glamorous enough and favored hosting Putin at the White House, the president was reassured by aides that it would be an effective backdrop. And long believing in the power of personal connections, he has insisted to aides that it was essential to sit down with Putin to establish a rapport. ### FILE - In this Tuesday, June 12, 2018 file photo, U. S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un at the Capella resort on Sentosa Island in Singapore. President Donald Trump has already met with Russian President Vladimir Putin twice, but he is eager to recreate in Finland the heady experience that he had last month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. That Singapore summit became a mass media event complete with powerful presidential images. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) ### ""He's been very nice to me the times I've met him. I've been nice to him. He's a competitor,"" Trump said of Putin last week in Brussels. ""You know, somebody was saying, 'Is he an enemy?' No, he's not my enemy. 'Is he a friend?' No, I don't know him well enough."" ### Drawing on his experience as a marketer and salesman, Trump has long been convinced that his mastery of powerful images has been essential to his political rise. The president has told advisers that the Singapore diplomacy made him look like a take-charge president. And it was not lost on him that his poll numbers received a temporary bump after the meeting. ### With the same attention to detail that he devoted to campaign ads, Trump masterminded many of the looks for his meeting with Kim, including the two leaders' dramatic initial greeting and handshake and, later, their one-on-one time. At one point, he startled the Secret Service by giving Kim an impromptu tour of some mighty American machinery - the presidential limousine known as ""The Beast."" ### Though the results from the North Korea summit are debatable, Trump has told confidants he believed it was a masterstroke, according to three outside advisers and White House officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. ### Always favoring bold gambits that would separate him from his predecessors, Trump believed that the historic meeting with Kim was potentially his ticket for a Nobel Peace Prize and would become an essential part of his legacy. While summits with Russian leaders are far more common, Trump believes a similar boost would occur if he can improve relations with Moscow and get Putin to make concessions never attained by President Barack Obama. ### ""I could say: 'Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Syria,'"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News last month. ""'Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Ukraine?'"" ### And while the imagery of Singapore made the idea of a Putin summit that much more tantalizing, Trump was already keen on setting up a one-on-one meeting, even with the risks entailed in meeting an experienced leader who is also a former KGB official. ### The president met with Putin on the sidelines of international summits last year - once in Germany, once in Vietnam - and both times he invited his Russian counterpart to the White House, according to three current and former administration officials. He reiterated the invitation on a call with Putin this spring and initially told aides that he wanted to have the meeting at the White House. ### He was later convinced to do it abroad, tacking the summit onto his planned visit to Belgium and Britain. Initially concerned that Helsinki was not a fitting location, Trump relented after being briefed on the history of U.S.-Russia summits in Finland and after seeing that it could be scheduled after a visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland, according to the three outside advisers and officials. ### But many in Washington are leery of the summit occurring anywhere, believing that just by agreeing to meet, Trump has offered further global legitimacy to Putin, who will preside over the World Cup final in Moscow the day before the summit. Aides have argued to Trump that the chances of substantive progress on a host of thorny issues, including Syria and Ukraine, are slim. ### Longtime American allies and White House aides alike have expressed concerns about the meeting. Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and the ongoing special counsel probe into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. There were calls from Capitol Hill for the president to cancel the summit after Friday's indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in an effort to help Trump. ### ""If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward,"" said Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. ### But the White House has insisted the meeting is on. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking and frequently derided special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise the election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said on Friday, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### ___ ### Colvin reported from Glasgow, Scotland. ### ___"

In 2009, when Putin first met Barack Obama, in Moscow, this soliloquy lasted nearly an hour before Obama could speak a word. “It was a story of grievance and frustration, with Russia as victim,” I wrote, describing that meeting in a piece last week previewing the Helsinki summit . ### Might Putin's opening talking points be shorter this time around? After all, in successive tweets and statements, Trump has already made many of Putin’s traditional arguments himself: the Mueller investigation, Trump argued, which most recently charged twelve Russian military-intelligence agents with hacking the Democratic Party’s e-mail servers, is an attempt to undermine Trump’s authority and spoil U.S.-Russia relations; thornier problems like Ukraine, and especially the status of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, might be forgotten, and they are all Obama’s fault anyway; and most tellingly, the misunderstanding and animus in the relations between the two countries are the fault of the United States. (As my colleague Susan B. Glasser noted , Trump’s tweet, this morning, blaming past U.S. Presidents for the poor relations prompted a pithy “We agree” tweet from the Russian Foreign Ministry.) ### After Putin and Trump shook hands here in Helsinki and began their first, one-on-one meeting, Trump was voluble and full of praise for Putin—hailing the World Cup, which wrapped up in Moscow yesterday, and declaring the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, a “mutual friend.” Again, he stated his hope for improved relations. Putin was taciturn and withdrawn, letting Trump do the talking. That is likely to be the theme of the day: as one sharp political observer back in Moscow told me, Putin doesn’t have to say much in Helsinki, let alone give anything away. “Trump will sell out the store himself,” he said. ### Joshua Yaffa is a New Yorker contributor based in Moscow.

( ### Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP ### By The Associated Press ### With a wink and a slouch, respectively, President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin opened their long-awaited summit Monday as the American leader declared that ""the world wants to see us get along"" and predicted rosy future relations. Trump laid out a list of topics for discussion that notably did not include Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. ### ""We have not been getting along well for the last number of years,"" Trump said as he and Putin sat down at the Presidential Palace in Finland's capital. ""But I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship. ... I really think the world wants to see us get along."" ### Putin, for his part, said he and Trump have maintained regular contact through phone calls and meetings at international events but ""the time has come to have a thorough discussion on various international problems and sensitive issues."" He added: ""There are quite a few of them for us to pay attention to."" ### Their opening one-on-one session ran well past the scheduled 90 minutes. ### The summit, which is being closely watched around the world, was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump's presidential campaign. Trump said last week that he planned to again raise the meddling issue with Putin, but questions have been swirling about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the interference that prompted a special investigation probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."" ### Addressing reporters before the one-on-one meeting, Putin struck a casual pose during Trump's remarks, slouching in his chair with his legs wide and eyes low. He nodded along to some of Trump's remarks before they were translated, showcasing his fluency in English. Trump leaned forward in his chair, his hands tented in front of him and frequently glanced over at the Russian president. At one point, he shot Putin a wink. After Trump concluded his remarks, American reporters shouted several questions about whether he would bring up election meddling during his discussions with Putin. ### Trump did not respond; Putin appeared to smirk. ### With that, the leaders gave a quick handshake and their private meeting in the opulent Gothic Hall was under way. Just the two of them, each with a translator. ### They were to continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. They'll conclude the summit by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### On the streets, the summit attracted a grab-bag of protesters, with abortion-rights activists wearing artificially bulging bellies and Trump masks, anti-fascist protesters bearing signs with expletive-laden insults, and free traders, anti-war Ukrainians and gay rights supporters making their voices heard. ### The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States -- and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea -- for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow's aggression may go unchallenged. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming ""many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" ### The Russian foreign ministry responded, first by liking Trump's tweet and then replying: ""We agree."" ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian's leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British queen, among many others. ### Several dozen Trump supporters, many waving American flags and sporting ""Make America Great Again"" caps, cheered Trump near his waterfront hotel in Helsinki. Two held up a handwritten banner that read ""God Bless D & M Trump."" ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn't ""expect anything"" from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders met alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. Not mentioned: Election meddling or Syria. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a ""shameful comedy"" they claim has been staged to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties. ### In tweets Monday, Trump continued to undermine the investigation and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor. He claimed Obama ""was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it."" ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or the easing of crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow's attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria's border with Israel -- a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia's carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### View Comments"

In particular, if Trump endorses any rollback of sanctions imposed after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, or Russia’s return to the G7, Congress and America’s allies must be prepared to defy him. ### There are ample grounds to fear such an agreement when the two men meet in Finland. Trump’s most recent high-profile diplomatic meeting, with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, showcased his weakness as a negotiator. And it shows where the president’s interests lie: He wants something that looks like a diplomatic victory for himself, no matter what it costs the United States. ### Advertisement ### Admittedly, Trump’s hands are more tied when it comes to Russia. He can’t unilaterally unravel the sanctions. But even a public endorsement of, for instance, readmitting Russia to the G7 would amount to a propaganda victory for Putin. Unless the Russians actually change their behavior in Ukraine — and there is no sign that’s even on the table — there is no reason to relax any of the sanctions.  ### Sign Up ### Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here ### In the lead-up to the meeting, much of the commentary in the United States has focused on Friday’s indictment of 12 Russian agents accused of hacking the Democratic Party during the 2016 presidential election, and whether Trump will protest to Putin. ### Related Links ### Read: Donald Trump and Russia: the great enigma of our political moment ### Unfortunately, that’s a lost cause at this point. Even if he musters up some pro forma outrage, anything Trump says will be empty words. It’s abundantly clear from his tweets and statements that Trump sees Russian hacking only through the prism of his personal political fortunes, and doesn’t view it as an attack on his country. ### Would it be nice if Trump admonished Putin for the hacking when they meet on Monday? Sure — especially if he actually meant it. ### But more important is the rest of the presidents’ conversation. If the meeting ends with a deal that compromises Europe’s security and rewards military aggression, the allies that Trump spent most of last week abusing need to lead the way in pushing back. And Congress and other political leaders will need to publicly assure them that America has their back — even if its president doesn’t."

Hennigan ### How President Trump Could Reset the Russia Conversation With an Arms Deal ### More ### In light of the indictments Friday of a dozen Russian intelligence officers on charges of meddling in the 2016 election, there have been public calls for President Donald Trump to cancel his much-anticipated summit with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. ### Several key senators, including Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Sen. John McCain, asked for the meeting in Helsinki to be rescheduled. ### Trump has decided to go through with it anyway, eager to discuss a wide-range of topics in hopes of resetting the conversation, including an opportunity for the two leaders to negotiate a deal around nuclear weapons reductions. ### “The proliferation is a tremendous, I mean to me, it’s the biggest problem in the world: nuclear weapons. Biggest problem in the world,” he said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May while visiting her Chequers country home. ### “So if we could do something to substantially reduce them — I mean, ideally, get rid of them. Maybe that’s a dream,” Trump added. “But certainly it’s a subject that I’ll be bringing up.” ### The meeting presents Trump and Putin with an opportunity to revitalize efforts to develop, extend, or strengthen existing arms treaties designed to limit the spread of nuclear arms. It comes at a critical time when several Cold War-era arms control agreements between the two nations, which helped prevent inconceivable catastrophes and widespread proliferation for nearly a half-century, are set to expire or are on the cusp of falling apart. ### While there are several nuclear arms issues where the U.S. and Russia remain at diplomatic impasse, there’s at least one that Trump and Putin could easily agree upon in Helsinki, arms control experts say: Extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START . ### The treaty, a linchpin arms-control agreement, is set to expire on Feb. 5, 2021. However, if both presidents agree, deal can be extended by up to five years without further approval by the U.S. Senate or Russian Duma due to a clause in that’s in the already-ratified treaty. ### “If they’re going to take up arms control, this would be the easiest thing to do,” said Madelyn Creedon, who served as deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration during the Obama administration. ### The 2010 deal limits each side to 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed heavy bombers and ballistic missiles. It also includes a thorough monitoring and verification regime to help ensure compliance. If it sunsets, it will be the first time in the effort to limit the strategic stockpiles in the U.S. and Russia since 1972. ### Putin has publicly supported extending New START and the White House recently directed an interagency review to explore whether to move forward with it — after Trump tweeted about stopping the arms race. ### There are political headwinds, though, because the U.S. and Russia have accused one another of violating current arms control agreements. Members inside the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans have said the U.S. shouldn’t be embarking on new deals without resolving the discrepancies. ### “I think even the topic of arms control can be rather difficult to undertake,” Creedon told reporters in a call organized by the Arms Control Association, a Washington think tank. “Politically, it would still be very difficult to even have the discussion because of Russia’s continuing violation of the INF.” ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, a 30-year-old arms-control pact, is currently hanging by a thread. The 1987 agreement, which was the first and only nuclear arms control treaty that ever eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons, forced the superpowers to scrap more than 2,600 missiles with ranges 310 to 3,420 miles — weapons considered destabilizing to the European continent because their capability to launch a nuclear strike from anywhere without early warning. ### U.S. intelligence first recognized Moscow’s potential violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty several years ago when the Russian missile was still in test phase. The Obama Administration worked unsuccessfully to persuade the Kremlin to stand down the program. (The Trump Administration has decided to respond with a missile of its own .) Russia has likewise accused the U.S. of violating the agreement because of the deployment of certain missile defense systems in Europe. ### The U.S. and Russia have engaged diplomatic talks on this issue for years without making progress. This means the INF issue is unlikely to be resolved in Helsinki, because of the reluctance of either side to admit a violation, according to Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. “The INF issue is technically complex,” he said. “I don’t think the leaders are going to be equipped to talk about the details.” ### However, the Administration should not let the INF issue handcuff it on other nuclear-related topics, he said. ### The prospect of not being able to restrain nuclear weapons, which can obliterate a major American city and the millions of people living within it, is a chilling notion that must never be realized, said Thomas M. Countryman, a 35-year career diplomat who retired last year after leading the State Department’s nonproliferation efforts. He hopes Trump and Putin can simply repeat a similar statement issued by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev during the heights of the Cold War: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. ### A declaration like that wouldn’t “require long technical complex discussions between the two presidents,” Countryman said. “It simply requires them to make very straightforward statements that would lead to progress between the two sides.” ### The U.S. arsenal hit its peak in 1967 with a stockpile of more than 31,255 nuclear weapons. While the Soviet Union had amassed an equally devastating number of warheads, neither side believed their arsenal was superior in strength to survive a conflict."

Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times ### Mr. Trump began the day of the meeting by blaming the United States for its poor relationship with Russia, casting aspersions on the federal investigation into Moscow’s cyberattack on the 2016 presidential election even as he said he felt “just fine” about meeting with Mr. Putin. ### In a pair of tweets sent on Monday before he headed for breakfast at Mantyniemi Palace, a residence of the Finnish president, Mr. Trump twice branded the special counsel investigation into Russia’s election interference the “Rigged Witch Hunt.” That investigation, and “many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity,” he wrote, are why the United States’ relationship with Russia “has NEVER been worse.” ### He did not mention the factors that are usually cited in the West as causes for friction with Moscow: Russia’s annexation of Crimea, its support for rebels in Ukraine and for the Assad regime in Syria, its meddling in the elections of the United States and in those of other countries, and the nerve agent poisonings in England that the British government has said the Kremlin was behind. ### Mr. Trump also lashed out at former President Barack Obama for the second day in a row, tweeting that his predecessor had failed to intervene to stop Russia’s hacking because he “thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election.” ### OPEN Interactive Graphic ### The messages suggested that Mr. Trump, who has never directly condemned Mr. Putin for the election meddling and has cast doubt on whether he even agrees with his own intelligence community’s finding that it was carried out by Moscow, has not changed his stance in the wake of the indictment last week of 12 Russian agents in the attack. ### Advertisement ### Continue reading the main story ### Mr. Trump has said that he will ask Mr. Putin about the meddling during their talks but that he does not expect the Russian president to admit culpability and that the issue is primarily an obstacle to his desire to improve relations between the United States and Russia. ### Later, at the breakfast with President Sauli Niinisto of Finland and his wife, Mr. Trump telegraphed confidence about the summit meetings, saying, “We’ll do just fine.” — Julie Hirschfeld Davis ### After a flirtation, a formal sit-down in Helsinki. ### Photo ### Leonid I. Brezhnev with President Gerald R. Ford in Helsinki, Finland, in 1975. Credit Associated Press ### They have called each other and met publicly at least twice on the sidelines of international events: at the Group of 20 summit meeting last July in Hamburg, Germany, and at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in November in Danang, Vietnam. ### But Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin are holding their first formal summit meeting in Helsinki on Monday. ### According to the office of the Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, the American and Russian leaders will sit down at the 19th-century presidential palace. Some likely topics of discussion: nuclear proliferation, Syria, Iran, Ukraine and Russian election meddling, to name a few. ### To tighten security for the meeting, Finland said it had temporarily reinstated border passport controls for travelers from the Schengen area, the 26 European nations that ordinarily allow people to cross from one country to another without border checks. The controls began on Friday and will last for four days. ### It was in the Finnish capital in 1975 that President Gerald R. Ford and the Soviet leader then, Leonid I. Brezhnev, along with other European leaders, signed the Helsinki Accords . The Soviets had pushed for the deal to cement their expanded borders, and Western nations used it to pressure the Soviets on human rights and other issues. ### It was also in Helsinki that Mr. Brezhnev offered to help Mr. Ford win the next presidential election, according to a former White House arms control adviser. ### Trump’s camp begins the expectation-lowering game. ### Continue reading the main story ### Photo ### Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, arriving in Vantaa, Finland, on Sunday. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times ### Whatever you do, don’t call it a “summit.” ### A day before Mr. Trump was to meet with Mr. Putin, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the United States ambassador to Russia, played down expectations for the encounter, trying to downgrade it to mere “meeting” status as he emphasized that it was more about reducing hostilities than about delivering on specific policy goals. ### Advertisement ### Continue reading the main story ### “It isn’t a summit — I’ve heard it called a summit — it’s a meeting,” Mr. Huntsman said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, noting that there would be no state dinner and no joint statement from the leaders at the end. “This is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama, and quite frankly some of the danger, out of the relationship right now.” ### Still, the two presidents are expected to hold extensive meetings — including a one-on-one session, another with top advisers present and a working lunch — before they face the news media together. ### And when Mr. Huntsman briefed reporters this month to preview the scheduled interaction, he referred to it repeatedly as a “summit,” and called it a landmark event. ### “You know, I think the fact that we’re having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,” Mr. Huntsman said at the time. “I don’t exclude that there will be some concrete agreement that will be announced coming out on the other end of the summit.” ### Mr. Trump has spent the past few days trying to lower expectations himself, telling CBS in an interview on Saturday, “I go in with low expectations.” ### But on Sunday, he parted ways with his envoy to Moscow in a tweet storm from Air Force One in which he lamented that no matter how well the meetings went, he would be criticized afterward. ### Mr. Trump called it a “summit.” ### — Julie Hirschfeld Davis ### Photo ### Crowds on Sunday at a “Helsinki Calling” protest ahead of the summit meeting. Credit Leonhard Foeger/Reuters ### There is no giant balloon portraying Mr. Trump as a big angry baby in diapers in the Finnish capital, as there was in London last week and in Edinburgh on Saturday. In Helsinki, the final stop of Mr. Trump’s disruption tour of Europe, he has to share being the target of protesters’ ridicule and rage with Mr. Putin. ### Shortly before Mr. Trump arrived in Finland on Sunday, thousands of protesters marched through the center of Helsinki in a display of equal-opportunity anger, directed at both leaders. ### Advertisement ### “Trump-Putin — the two-headed monster,” read a hand-painted sign carried by Paulina Pepaola, a Finnish woman who joined the march from a park near the central train station to Senate Square. ### “I am totally against both of them,” she said. “They are working together. Putin controls Trump.” ### Newsletter Sign Up ### Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. ### Invalid email address. Please re-enter. ### You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

Go home,” read a banner unfurled outside the colonnaded entrance to Helsinki Cathedral, which dominates the square. ### A Finnish musical group, Tuomo & Markus, sent a message of its own, releasing on YouTube a version of Bob Dylan’s 1989 song “Political World.” ### “While we believe in constructive dialogue, we strongly oppose to the existing world views and politics of Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Human rights, freedom of speech, gender equality nor climate change don’t seem to fit in their vocabulary,” the group said in a statement posted on its website. “Please prove us wrong,” it added. ### But not everyone was inhospitable. A Russian-Finnish friendship association, RUFI, announced that it would hold its own rally i n Senate Square on Monday to welcome Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump, and “to show our highly placed guests that not everybody in Finland has a negative view of world leaders, that not all thirst for conflict, even war.” ### Advertisement ### Some analysts also note that while Mr. Trump abhors briefing memos, Mr. Putin will be well schooled before the meeting. Analysts say the fact that the meeting is occurring at all is already a victory of sorts for the Russian leader. ### White House advisers have described the summit meeting as a chance to reset a tense relationship, and Mr. Trump has dismissed concerns , mocking those who point to Mr. Putin’s past as a spymaster, suggesting that he could manipulate the American leader. ### “‘You know, President Putin is K.G.B.,’ and this and that,” Mr. Trump said. “You know what? Putin’s fine. He’s fine. We’re all fine. We’re people. Will I be prepared? Totally prepared. I’ve been preparing for this stuff my whole life.” ### A message on press freedom greets two leaders who attack the press. ### “Mr. President, welcome to the land of free press,” reads one giant digital billboard that toggles between English and Russian. Other signs, more than 280 in all, bear headlines about both presidents’ assaults on journalists. ### “Trump calls media enemy of the people,” one reads. ### “Putin increases attacks on media,” says another. ### The headlines are from Helsingin Sanomat, Finland’s largest newspaper and the sponsor of the advertising campaign that placed billboards along the route from the airport to downtown Helsinki, where the two presidents are to meet. ### The paper also produced a video showing Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin lashing out against news organizations, something Mr. Trump did even as Air Force One made its way to Helsinki on Sunday, when he tweeted that “much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people” and would not give him proper credit for the summit meeting. ### The Land of Free Press Video by Helsingin Sanomat ### “The two presidents are known for their previous attempts to control the media,” reads a subtitle on the video, which calls Finland “one of the highest-ranking countries in press freedom.” ### “So,” it concludes, “these headlines are free to tell the truth.” ### — Julie Hirschfeld Davis"

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. ### JUST WATCHED ### Ana Navarro slams Trump's 'appalling' call ### Helsinki, Finland (CNN) ### President Donald Trump plans to raise the issue of election meddling in his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but he told officials during his UK visit that he already knows Putin will again deny interference in the 2016 election -- and doesn't expect much progress, according to a source familiar with the discussion. ### Trump signaled as much at a joint news conference Friday with British Prime Minister Theresa May . ### ""I will absolutely bring that up. I don't think you'll have any, 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.' There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think, but you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely, firmly ask the question,"" Trump said. ""And hopefully, we'll have a very good relationship with Russia."" ### Putin looms for Trump after reality-bending visit with US allies ### Instead, the US President is setting his sights on establishing a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) between the United States and Russia to continue decades of progressive nuclear disarmament between the two countries, the source told CNN. The source said Trump has been fired up about making progress on extending the US and Russia's denuclearization treaty, now known as New Start which is set to expire in 2021. ### Trump sees progress on an arms control treaty as the likeliest area of progress for the Trump-Putin summit, the source said. ### Read More ### ""The proliferation is a tremendous -- I mean, to me, it's the biggest problem in the world, nuclear weapons. Biggest problem in the world,"" Trump said on Friday. ""So, we could do something to substantially reduce them -- I mean, ideally get rid of them. It's -- maybe that's a dream."" ### The White House declined a CNN request for comment. ### But as Trump and Putin prepare to arrive in Helsinki, the source with knowledge of the discussions said there is still no set, organized agenda for the summit. Privately, Trump has also made clear that he is unsure how the summit will unfold and what the outcome will be, the source said. ### The risks of the meeting, the source said, are if Trump offers something for free -- such as reducing US support for Ukraine or offers ambiguity on Crimea. Or if Trump's bonding with Putin emboldens Europeans who want to lift sanctions on Russia -- the new Italian government, Hungary or Austria. ### Trump and US officials have made clear they intend to raise a series of issues during the Helsinki summit, from the ongoing civil war in Syria to Russian actions in Ukraine to cyberactivities and North Korea. ### JUST WATCHED"

The agenda for the one-on-one meeting is not completely clear. (July 13) ### Media: Associated Press ### WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's persistence in pursuing friendly ties with Vladimir Putin has highlighted a growing disconnect within his administration over Russia policy. Trump speaks fondly of Putin and a desire for better relations with Moscow, but the rest of his executive branch remains highly critical and deeply suspicious of the Russian president and the Kremlin's intentions. ### The stark contrast in approaches has been thrown into sharp relief as Trump and Putin prepare for their summit in Finland on Monday, amid unremitting criticism of Russia from Trump's State Department, Justice Department, Treasury Department and Defense Department. ### That might be explained as a good cop-bad cop strategy with Russia. But the mixed messaging has left America's friends and allies confused, particularly after a contentious NATO summit where Trump questioned the value of the alliance that Putin has long denounced and sought to weaken. ### Just three days before the Helsinki summit, the Justice Department announced the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers in special counsel Robert Muller's investigation into Moscow's meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. That brings to 25 the number of Russians charged in the investigation. Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has repeatedly cited Putin's denials of any Russian interference in the campaign, suggesting there is little or nothing he can do to demand accountability. The Kremlin has denied that the Russian state interfered in the election. ### window._taboola = window._taboola || [];    _taboola.push({      mode: 'thumbnails-c',      container: 'taboola-interstitial-gallery-thumbnails-3',      placement: 'Interstitial Gallery Thumbnails 3',      target_type: 'mix'    });    _taboola.push({flush: true}); ### Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev, AP ### Close ### Image 1 of 3 ### FILE - In this Nov. 11, 2017, file photo, U.S. President Donald Trump, right, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin talk during the family photo session at the APEC Summit in Danang.

You got me!' There won't be Perry Mason here, I don't think. But I will absolutely, firmly ask the question."" ### Trump also has expressed little interest in continuing the harsh U.S. criticism of Russian activities in Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere, and of Russia's human rights record. In fact, he's raised doubts about U.S. demands for Russia to return to Ukraine the territory of Crimea it annexed in 2014, and has suggested a bargain could be in the works for Russia's ally Bashar Assad to remain in power indefinitely in Syria. ### Contrast that with the messaging of the State Department. ### Under Trump, the department has issued regular stinging critiques of Russia, including on human rights and press freedom. Those have been sustained since former CIA Director Mike Pompeo was installed as top U.S. diplomat in April and despite the president's growing calls for friendship with Putin. ### Read Full Article ### Ahead of Russia's national day on June 12, Pompeo said the United States honors ""the citizens of the Russian Federation and their aspirations for the democratic principles of universal freedom, civil liberties, and the rule of law."" On July 6, department spokeswoman Heather Nauert condemned the ""selective targeting"" by Russia of U.S.-funded news organizations. And this Thursday the department criticized a ""pattern of intimidation and violence against those who express dissent across Russia."" ### Pompeo has also been steadfast in his support of NATO. ### While Trump was questioning the commitment of NATO allies at this past week's summit in Brussels, where leaders agreed on modest steps to improve military readiness in Europe, principally to counter Russia, Pompeo was lauding the 29-nation grouping as ""the most successful alliance in history."" ### Pompeo also warned in a tweet: ""Weakness provokes; strength and cohesion protect."" ### Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has been no less critical of Russia and its attempts to weaken or entirely subvert trans-Atlantic alliances. ### ""Putin seeks to shatter NATO,"" he told graduates of the U.S. Naval War College last month. ""He aims to diminish the appeal of the Western democratic model and attempts to undermine America's moral authority. His actions are designed not to challenge our arms at this point but to undercut and compromise our belief in our ideals."" ### Measure that against Trump's suggestion at a rancorous summit of the Group of Seven last month in Canada that the leading industrialized countries include Russia in their elite grouping of democracies — a suggestion that got short shrift from the other nations. ### And as Trump has talked about bringing Putin back into the international fold, the Treasury Department has continued to impose sanctions on various Russian officials, companies and businessmen. ### Days after the G-7, the Treasury blacklisted five Russian companies and three individuals, some of whom are accused of directly supporting Russia's intelligence agency in its efforts to carry out cyberattacks, including intrusions into America's energy grid and threats to underwater cables that transmit much of the world's communications data."

Try one month for $1! ### Subscribe ### By Associated Press ### GLASGOW, Scotland — President Donald Trump says “nothing bad … maybe some good” will come out of Monday’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as he attempted to lower expectations for what the meeting may actually achieve. Trump’s national security adviser said they aren’t looking for “concrete deliverables.” ### Trump also says he “hadn’t thought” about asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in Washington on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but says “certainly I’ll be asking about it.” ### He blamed the Democratic National Committee for “allowing themselves to be hacked.” ### The U.S. has no extradition treaty with Moscow and can’t compel Russia to hand over citizens, and a provision in Russia’s constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens to foreign countries. ### Asked whether Trump would ask Putin to turn over the 12 military intelligence officials, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton called the idea “pretty silly” and said doing so would put the president in a “weak position.” ### He said Trump is going into the summit with a stronger hand because of the indictments. ### “I think the president can put this on the table and say, ‘This is a serious matter that we need to talk about,'” Bolton said. He said asking for the indicted Russians to be turned over would have the opposite effect. ### “For the president to demand something that isn’t going to happen puts the president in a weak position, and I think the president has made it very clear he intends to approach this discussion from a position of strength.” ### In the interview with CBS News, Trump said he’s entering the meeting in Finland with “low expectations. I’m not going with high expectations.” ### Trump taped the interview Saturday in Scotland. CBS News released excerpts Sunday, hours before Trump was set to fly to Helsinki for the summit. Trump said such sessions are beneficial. He cited his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June as “a good thing” and says “having meetings with Russia, China, North Korea, I believe in it.” ### “Nothing bad is going to come out of it (Helsinki), and maybe some good will come out,” he said. ### Trump and Putin have met twice before, during international summits last year in Germany and in Vietnam. But Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, says Monday’s meeting “is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation and I hope it’s a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests.” ### The president opened his first meeting with Putin — it lasted more than two hours last July in Hamburg, Germany — by pressing Putin on Russian election meddling and Putin denied being involved, according to U.S. officials who described the meeting afterward. ### Congressional Democrats and at least one Republican have called on the president to pull out of Monday’s meeting unless he is willing to make Russian election-meddling the top issue. Huntsman said the meeting must go on because some international issues can’t be solved without Russian engagement. ### “Right now, there’s no trust in the relationship and, because of that, problem-solving is practically impossible,” Huntsman said. “So this is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama and quite frankly some of the danger out of the relationship right now.” ### Huntsman added: “The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off-the-charts high so it’s a good thing these presidents are getting together.” ### Trump has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling, along with Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation and other topics. Bolton described the meeting as “unstructured,” saying: “We’re not looking for concrete deliverables here.” ### Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., meanwhile, suggested that Trump not even bother to press Putin on election meddling because “he’s not going to admit that he did it.” Instead, Paul said Trump and other U.S. officials should focus on safeguarding upcoming elections from interference. ### Huntsman was interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Paul appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and Bolton spoke with ABC’s “This Week.”"

The president has continued his solicitousness toward Putin, even suggesting the U.S. adversary could potentially be a friend some day. ### According to top advisers of the president, Mr. Trump's private one-on-one meeting with Putin is scheduled to last about a half hour but could go even longer. Putin has met with three previous U.S. presidents before Mr. Trump, but there has never been such a private session of this magnitude between Putin and a U.S. leader. ### Following their one-on-one meeting, Putin and Mr. Trump are expected to take part in an expanded bilateral meeting with top advisers, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, chief of staff John Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton. It is in that meeting that the leaders might delve into more substantive issues. ### A joint press conference now confirmed by the U.S. will be the last event on the schedule. ### World leaders and members of the political world, both Republican and Democrat alike, have expressed deep concerns over the private meeting.

I've been here not too long, but it's getting close to two years, but I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship."" ### On nuclear weapons: ""I really think the world wants to see us get along. We are the two great nuclear powers. We have 90% of the nuclear — and that's not a good thing, it's a bad thing."" ### Trump did not say he would address Russia's meddling in the 2016 US election, which critics have called an act of war. ### Putin also offered remarks through a translator, but they were not immediately audible. ### 48 min ago ### Here they are: Trump and Putin meet ahead of one-on-one ### President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin just met ahead of their one-on-one.

""I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship."" ### Trump arrived Monday afternoon at the Finnish presidential palace for what he has called a summit with Putin, hoping once again that his personal touch can reverse the steep decline in U.S.-Russia relations in recent years. ### U.S. officials have stressed the path to improving U.S.-Russia ties runs through a clear-eyed understanding of Russian aggression and the root causes of discord in the relationship, but Trump is signaling a different course. He is holding previous U.S. administrations and the Justice Department's investigation stemming from Russian meddling in the 2016 election responsible. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" Trump tweeted Monday morning ahead of the summit. ### twitter/@realDonaldTrump via CNN ### Trump and Putin arrived separately at the Finnish presidential palace, about 45 minutes behind schedule. Trump held at his hotel while he waited for Putin, who is known for arriving late to important events, to touch down -- drawing comparisons to Trump's late arrivals at recent summits with U.S. allies. ### They then walked into a room at the presidential palace together before offering brief remarks before a gaggle of cameras and reporters, with Trump congratulating Putin once again ""on a really great World Cup."" ### The two men shook hands after speaking before reporters were ushered out. ### For the next hour-and-a-half, Trump and Putin are scheduled to hold one-on-one discussions, with only interpreters at their side. ### Trump was eager to have time alone with Putin to better personally assess him and develop a personal relationship, according to a U.S. official, but he has also expressed anger at leaks from his meetings with foreign leaders and told aides he wanted to ensure his sensitive discussions with Putin remained secret. ### The official also said that Trump doesn't want aides -- who may take a harder line on Russia -- undercutting or interrupting him during his talks with Putin. ### Just days earlier, Trump pointed to the ""pure stupidity"" and a ""political problem"" in the United States for making it ""very hard to do something with Russia."" ### ""Anything you do, it's always going to be, 'Oh, Russia, he loves Russia,' "" Trump said during a joint news conference with his British counterpart. ### Trump's Monday morning tweet and his words and actions in the last week have only amplified concerns about his approach to Russia among U.S. allies and lawmakers of both parties in Washington. ### During his swing through Brussels and the United Kingdom, Trump has repeatedly criticized U.S. allies, called the European Union a ""foe"" and criticized the Obama administration rather than Russia in the wake of the Justice Department's indictment of 12 Russian agents who allegedly worked to hack Democrats' emails and computer networks during the 2016 election. ### Ahead of his meeting with Putin -- who is alleged to be behind the assassination of journalists and political dissidents -- the US President also lashed out again at the news media on Sunday by branding journalists ""the enemy of the people."" ### Trump again -- as he has repeatedly done -- pointed the finger at his predecessor President Barack Obama and characterized the investigation stemming from Russian election interference as a ""witch hunt."" ### ""President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it,"" Trump tweeted. ""When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!"" ### Everything from Russian meddling in the 2016 election to the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine are expected to be on the agenda for their summit here in Helsinki, but Trump has signaled he is most eager to jumpstart talks to ""substantially reduce"" the two countries' nuclear weapons arsenals and generally improve U.S.-Russia relations. ### Trump is not, however, expected to offer to halt military exercises in the Baltics as part of his discussions with Putin, with a U.S. official telling CNN's Jeff Zeleny ""at least that's the plan going in."" ### The question of the Baltics exercises has hung over the summit, particularly after Trump abruptly decided last month to agree to stop joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises during his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Trump has said he intends to once again ask Putin about Russian efforts to sway the results of the 2016 election but has signaled he will not press the issue. ### ""I know you'll ask, will we be talking about meddling. I will absolutely bring that up. I don't think you'll have any, 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.' There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think, but you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely, firmly ask the question,"" Trump said. ### Trump has sought to cool expectations in the last days leading up to the summit, saying in an interview Saturday that he planned to arrive in Helsinki ""with very low expectations."" ### ""I think that getting along with Russia is a good thing, but it's possible we won't,"" Trump said. ### Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

Undeterred, the American president was set to go face to face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### Trump was greeted at the palace by Finland’s president. The summit was starting later than scheduled because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour late in another display of the Russian’s leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British Queen, among many others. ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn’t “expect anything” from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn’t looking for any “concrete deliverables.” Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland’s president that he thought the summit would go “fine.” ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a “witch hunt.” ### In his tweets, Trump continued to undermine the investigation and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia’s efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump’s favor. He claimed Obama “was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it.” ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin’s primary mission was simply to have the summit happen. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one on one in the Finnish presidential palace’s opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor’s throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow’s attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America’s closest allies, as a “foe.” ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump’s jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over “delinquent” defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### “NATO is now strong & rich!” Trump wrote in a celebratory tweet Monday morning. During his breakfast, he said NATO had “never been more together” and said the summit had been “a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love.” ### Prior to meeting Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump unleashed fresh attacks on the news media, including from aboard Air Force One as it descended into Helsinki. ### “Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” Trump tweeted. “Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!” ### “Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,” said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, “not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime.” ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week — another chaotic stop on his European tour — that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,’” said Trump, invoking a television detective. “There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question.” ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said “certainly I’ll be asking about it” although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn’t have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can’t force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia’s constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week’s indictment as part of a “shameful comedy” staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn’t contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria’s border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia’s carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level."

They had bad defenses and they were able to be hacked. But I heard they were trying to hack the Republicans too. But -- and this may be wrong -- but they had much stronger defenses.” ### Members of Congress in both parties have called on Trump to either confront Putin over Moscow’s interference in the election or cancel the meeting altogether in protest. The president’s critics fear the summit could lead to him relaxing U.S. sanctions against Russia, recognizing Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, or other concessions. Some democrats, such as Sen. Mark Warner even said other Americans need to be in the room. ### Warner, the Senate Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he would be ""stunned"" if Trump doesn't call out Putin's or Russia's ""bad behavior"" at Monday's meeting between the two leaders. But Warner said he fears Putin could take advantage of Trump in a one-on-one sit-down. ### ""Frankly, one of the things I'm most worried about is we need to have other Americans in the room,"" Warner told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""Vladimir Putin is a trained KGB agent, he may come in with maps of Syria, maps of Ukraine. And frankly, I think he'll take advantage of this president whom we know doesn't do much prep work before these meetings."" ### ""We need other individuals from his administration in the room so we know at least someone will press the Russians on making sure they don't interfere in future U.S. elections,"" he added. ### Responding to Democrat demands, Trump told Glor that he hasn’t decided whether to meet alone with Putin to start their summit, as he said he would last week. ### The two leaders will hold a news conference to conclude the summit, where they are all but certain to face multiple questions about the indictment from U.S. reporters. ### Finally, in a statement that will likely outrage the EU (even more), Trump called the European Union a “foe” of the United States.

I don't think you'll have any, 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.' There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think, but you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely, firmly ask the question,"" Trump said. ""And hopefully, we'll have a very good relationship with Russia."" ### Instead, the U.S. president is setting his sights on establishing a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) between the United States and Russia to continue decades of progressive nuclear disarmament between the two countries, the source told CNN. The source said Trump has been fired up about making progress on extending the U.S. and Russia's denuclearization treaty, now known as New Start which is set to expire in 2021. ### Trump sees progress on an arms control treaty as the likeliest area of progress for the Trump-Putin summit, the source said. ### ""The proliferation is a tremendous -- I mean, to me, it's the biggest problem in the world, nuclear weapons. Biggest problem in the world,"" Trump said on Friday. ""So, we could do something to substantially reduce them -- I mean, ideally get rid of them. It's -- maybe that's a dream."" ### The White House declined a CNN request for comment. ### But as Trump and Putin prepare to arrive in Helsinki, the source with knowledge of the discussions said there is still no set, organized agenda for the summit. Privately, Trump has also made clear that he is unsure how the summit will unfold and what the outcome will be, the source said. ### The risks of the meeting, the source said, are if Trump offers something for free -- such as reducing U.S. support for Ukraine or offers ambiguity on Crimea. Or if Trump's bonding with Putin emboldens Europeans who want to lift sanctions on Russia -- the new Italian government, Hungary or Austria. ### Trump and U.S. officials have made clear they intend to raise a series of issues during the Helsinki summit, from the ongoing civil war in Syria to Russian actions in Ukraine to cyberactivities and North Korea. ### Trump believes his discussions with Putin on Syria could yield the crude beginnings of a deal, but any agreement would be very preliminary. Trump, who is eager to withdraw U.S. troops from the country, would like for Russia to get the Iranians to pull out of Syria, according to the source, but many experts within and outside the administration see that as an unrealistic demand the Russians will not be able to deliver on. ### On North Korea, Ukraine and cyber issues, the potential outcomes of Trump and Putin's talks seem less clear. ### The source with knowledge of Trump's discussions said Putin is still eager to form a joint Russia-U.S. cybersecurity unit, which remains unlikely. The source said it is possible Trump and Putin agree to a working-level dialogue on cybersecurity issues. ### On North Korea, the source said Russian officials do not believe Trump's maximum pressure campaign has worked, but agree on the objective of nonproliferation and want to be involved in the denuclearization talks. ### The United States, though, would rather continue its bilateral talks with North Korea. However, this source believes it's likely Putin will offer technical assistance, such as expertise in the removal of nuclear material and that Trump may well agree to Russian involvement in some way, which would also be something of a win for Putin. ### Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

Endless media hype. Huge ratings. ### Although President Donald Trump has met with Russia's Vladimir Putin twice before, he is eager to recreate in Finland the heady experience that he had last month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore: a summit that became a mass media event complete with powerful presidential images. Ever the showman and insistent on establishing closer ties to Moscow, Trump overruled his advisers and demanded the rituals and pageantry of a formal summit. ### Trump had boasted to confidants about the number of cameras in Singapore, claiming it dwarfed coverage of the Oscars, according to a person familiar with his thinking but not authorized to discuss private conversations and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Though Trump originally expressed concern that Helsinki was not glamorous enough and favored hosting Putin at the White House, the president was reassured by aides that it would be an effective backdrop. And long believing in the power of personal connections, he has insisted to aides that it was essential to sit down with Putin to establish a rapport. ### ""He's been very nice to me the times I've met him. I've been nice to him.  He's a competitor,"" Trump said of Putin last week in Brussels. ""You know, somebody was saying, 'Is he an enemy?' No, he's not my enemy. 'Is he a friend?' No, I don't know him well enough."" ### Recommended Video: ### Now Playing: ### U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are to hold a summit in Finland on July 16.   On the agenda at the Helsinki meeting will be a range of security issues according to the White House. The last time the two leaders met was in November at the Asia Pacific summit.   Relations have been strained for some time over a number of issues including Russia's actions in Ukraine, but both leaders are reported to be keen on improving the situation.   The Finland summit comes after the U.S. National Security Advisor, John Bolton, met Vladimir Putin in  Moscow on Wednesday.  Reports are that that meeting went well and the Russian president said that it had raised hopes for a full restoration of relations that he admits are not as good as they could be.  But Putin blames political infighting in the U.S. rather than international events. ### Media: Euronews ### Drawing on his experience as a marketer and salesman, Trump has long been convinced that his mastery of powerful images has been essential to his political rise. The president has told advisers that the Singapore diplomacy made him look like a take-charge president. And it was not lost on him that his poll numbers received a temporary bump after the meeting. ### With the same attention to detail that he devoted to campaign ads, Trump masterminded many of the looks for his meeting with Kim, including the two leaders' dramatic initial greeting and handshake and, later, their one-on-one time. At one point, he startled the Secret Service by giving Kim an impromptu tour of some mighty American machinery — the presidential limousine known as ""The Beast."" ### Though the results from the North Korea summit are debatable, Trump has told confidants he believed it was a masterstroke, according to three outside advisers and White House officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. ### Always favoring bold gambits that would separate him from his predecessors, Trump believed that the historic meeting with Kim was potentially his ticket for a Nobel Peace Prize and would become an essential part of his legacy. While summits with Russian leaders are far more common, Trump believes a similar boost would occur if he can improve relations with Moscow and get Putin to make concessions never attained by President Barack Obama. ### ""I could say: 'Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Syria,'"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News last month. ""'Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Ukraine?'"" ### And while the imagery of Singapore made the idea of a Putin summit that much more tantalizing, Trump was already keen on setting up a one-on-one meeting, even with the risks entailed in meeting an experienced leader who is also a former KGB official. ### The president met with Putin on the sidelines of international summits last year — once in Germany, once in Vietnam — and both times he invited his Russian counterpart to the White House, according to three current and former administration officials. He reiterated the invitation on a call with Putin this spring and initially told aides that he wanted to have the meeting at the White House. ### He was later convinced to do it abroad, tacking the summit onto his planned visit to Belgium and Britain. Initially concerned that Helsinki was not a fitting location, Trump relented after being briefed on the history of U.S.-Russia summits in Finland and after seeing that it could be scheduled after a visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland, according to the three outside advisers and officials. ### But many in Washington are leery of the summit occurring anywhere, believing that just by agreeing to meet, Trump has offered further global legitimacy to Putin, who will preside over the World Cup final in Moscow the day before the summit. Aides have argued to Trump that the chances of substantive progress on a host of thorny issues, including Syria and Ukraine, are slim. ### Longtime American allies and White House aides alike have expressed concerns about the meeting. Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and the ongoing special counsel probe into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. There were calls from Capitol Hill for the president to cancel the summit after Friday's indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in an effort to help Trump. ### ""If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward,"" said Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. ### But the White House has insisted the meeting is on. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking and frequently derided special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise the election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said on Friday, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think.  But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### ___ ### Colvin reported from Glasgow, Scotland. ### ___"

Trump’s Monday tweet repeated his calling the investigation a “rigged witch hunt” — a sentiment retweeted by the Russian foreign ministry. ### That is the backdrop and context as Trump and Putin meet along the Baltic, seemingly more politically simpatico than many critics can fathom. ### Here is how some cartoonists are depicting Trump, Putin and their geopolitical relationship: ### Monte Wolverton (Cagle Cartoons):"
631,yahoo.com/news,2018-07-16T04:51:36-04:00,"World Cup 2018: Can Russia’s experiment in openness survive after successful tournament? ### Oliver Carroll ### It was trailed as the “World Cup of shame” , a magnet for terrorism , or, more simply, “ Putin’s cup” . ### In the event, Russia’s month-long showcase will be remembered for none of those things. Not that elements weren’t there. An embarrassing pitch invasion by punk activists Pussy Riot during the final – with corresponding demands for the release of political prisoners – will certainly cast a shadow. It is even suspected that two terror attacks may have taken place in Moscow and Sochi that have been covered up by local media and authorities. And the soft power benefit of a super-smooth tournament, complete with foreign fans berating the media for misleading them on Russia , cannot be understated. ### But Vladimir Putin was, in fact, largely absent from the stage. Not only literally – he only attended one match before the final, leaving his sleepy deputy Dmitry Medvedev to stand in – but also in a broader sense. Russian authorities were in light-touch mode: no clashes with riot police, no arrests for public gatherings, no excessive bureaucracy, no strongmen clamping down on the weak. In short, the Kremlin did everything it doesn’t usually do; and it allowed Russians to be open to the world. ### The world, generally speaking, liked what it saw. ### The football was good, too. With teams much closer to one another than previously thought, it was a tournament of drama, incongruity and the triumph of the supposed underdog. The final was a worthy finish to that, with Croatia, with a population of merely four million, more than competing against football’s establishment. In a thrilling match, they were unlucky to lose by two goals. ### A win would have been more than just the romantics’ choice. It would have allowed the hosts to claim they were one just goal away from the final. But in the end it was left to the French to do what they always seem to do – attack on the break and take their chances.. ### The world will now move on. Russia will have nothing but memories. But what memories they are: the five opening goals against Saudi Arabia; the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo turning up in provincial Saransk; the crazed and colourful Iranian, Peruvian, Colombian supporters; the Senegalese warm-up dance; the Japanese fans picking up their litter; the German machine breaking down; the Argentine despair amid Brazilian smugness; the Brazilian despair amid Argentine smugness; the sublime Belgian football; Pickford’s saves; England’s unexpected progress; and Gareth Southgate’s waistcoat. ### And, of course, for the hosts: that victory over Spain. ### Plenty of moments came off the field too. Across the country – from Saransk to Volgograd, Kaliningrad to Nizhny Novgorod – forgotten, somewhat neglected provincial cities were given a chance to shine. ### Imprisoned Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov timed his hunger strike to coincide with the tournament (AP) ### More ### But the capital was always the centre of the party. Many years from now, Muscovites will remember how the usually nondescript Nikolskaya Street, in the heart of the government district, became the centre of a colourful international carnival. It was here that fans of all nationalities celebrated and consoled one another. Here that friendships and more were formed. Here that foreigners joined Russians in bellowing “Ra-si-ya” – a three-syllable chant previously associated with Vladimir Putin’s post-Crimean election campaigns, but now, somehow, removed of toxicity. ### Story Continues ### According to cultural commentator Yuri Saprykin, Russians united in the absence of politics. ### “Russians came together not for Crimea, or for Putin, but for an idea of being with everyone – of being with the losing Spaniards, and the victorious Croats, and being for everything that is good, including the ability to be nice with other people,” he wrote in a much-cited column. ### The World Cup has been the first good-news Russia story since Perestroika, said another commentator . It cast Russians as normal people, with normal aspirations, hopes and fears. And it has allowed Russians to see foreigners in a different, less suspicious light. ### “The most positive thing is that it put paid to a widespread belief that Russia was a besieged fortress surrounded by enemies,” says Tanya Lokshina, lead Russia researcher for Human Rights Watch. ### State television was the architect and lead contractor for that besieged fortress; even they took an internationalist break. Throughout the tournament, propaganda flagship programmes kept negative stories to a minimum. Ukraine. Syria and Skripal were replaced by heartwarming tales of the foreigners’ free metro travel, visa-free travel, of exciting, exotic, and, yes, free train journeys between host cities. ### Hosts praised the foreign football fans, and they worshipped the fans who posted about their love for Russia. ### That social media triumph has been music to the ears of Russian authorities, long convinced of a Russophobic bias in the western media. Maria Zakharova, the outspoken press secretary of the foreign ministry, has wasted little time in feigning “surprise” at the words of gratitude coming by foreigners. Foreigners had finally seen through the lies, she triumphantly told her weekly press conference on Thursday. ### Part of her criticism is, no doubt, justified. The world saw a different Russia from the crass caricature often presented to them by lazy publications. But Russians also saw a different country to the one they were used to. This new Russia was more open, friendly, chaotic, and confident than the old one. Whether it remains once Fifa packs its bags is another matter – and largely out of the people's hands. ### If the past is any guide, the window may not stay open for long. After the end of the 1980 Olympics, for example, authorities spent the next few years perfecting a crackdown of the dissident movement. More recently, the 2014 Sochi Olympics, which began with the release of several prominent political prisoners (though it ended with the annexation of Crimea). Two of Pussy Riot’s members, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, were included in that amnesty. ### The signs of the older, blunter Russia have never been very far away. ### As the world watched football, an anti-gulag activist was rearrested on rape charges many believe to be trumped up. Imprisoned Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov continued a hunger strike, now surely entering its final days. Amazingly, Ramzan Kadyrov , the Chechen leader, was allowed to parade alongside superstar Mo Salah and the Egyptian team, even though he is widely believed to have ordered the torture and killing of gay men in Chechnya. And Oleg Titiev, an activist critical of Kadyrov, remains in jail on scarcely believable drugs charges. His case moved to trial last week; he faces up to 10 years in jail. ### Tanya Lokshina of Human Rights Watch says she views the World Cup as a lost opportunity. She criticises football’s governing authorities for failing to use its leverage over the Kremlin. ### “Fifa clearly hasn’t done justice to its new human rights policy,” she says. “Make no mistake: the overall picture remains pretty grim.”"

With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### FILE - In this Nov. 11, 2017 file photo, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin talk during the family photo session at the APEC Summit in Danang, Vietnam. The outcome of the first summit between the unpredictable first-term American president and Russia's steely-eyed longtime leader is anybody's guess. With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into their meeting, Monday, July 16, 2018 in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: (Jorge Silva/Pool Photo via AP, File) ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ""I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,"" Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### ""The fact that we're having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,"" said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. ""What is important here is that we start a discussion."" ### Trump has been drawn to the spectacle of the summit and has expressed an eagerness to recreate in Helsinki the media show of last month's Singapore summit when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Even as many NATO leaders made supportive noises this week, the Helsinki summit has raised fears in many global capitals that Trump will pull back from traditional Western alliances, allowing Putin to expand his sphere of influence. ### Back home, too, there is wariness on Capitol Hill, with a number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans urging Trump to cancel the summit in the wake of the explosive indictments. ### But Trump has vowed that he can handle Putin, whom he has taken to referring to as a ""competitor"" rather than an adversary. ### And Trump in recent days has outlined some of the items he'd like to discuss, including Ukraine. Though the president has said he was ""not happy"" about Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, he puts the blame on his predecessor and says he will continue relations with Putin even if Moscow refuses to return the peninsula. ### Trump also said he and Putin would discuss the ongoing war in Syria and arms control, negotiations that White House officials have signaled could be fruitful. ### ""I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,"" the president said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. ""We've been modernizing and fixing and buying. And it's just a devastating technology. And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it's a very, very bad policy."" ### But it is the matter of election meddling, including fears Russia could try to interfere in the midterm elections this fall, that could play a central role in the summit talks or loom even larger if not addressed. In neither of Trump's previous meetings with Putin - informal talks on the sidelines of summits last year in Germany and Vietnam - did the president publicly upbraid the Russian leader, prompting questions about whether he believed the former KGB officer's denials over his own intelligence agencies' assessments of meddling. ### Trump repeatedly has cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking of his Democratic rivals and disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise it with Putin even as he downplayed its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### WHAT PUTIN WANTS ### For Putin, sitting down with Trump offers a long-awaited chance to begin repairing relations with Washington after years of spiraling tensions. ### Putin wants the U.S. and its allies to lift sanctions, pull back NATO forces deployed near Russia's borders and restore business as usual with Moscow. In the longer run, he hopes to persuade the U.S. to acknowledge Moscow's influence over its former Soviet neighbors and, more broadly, recognize Russia as a global player whose interests must be taken into account. ### These are long-term goals, and Putin realizes that no significant progress will come from just one meeting. More than anything else, he sees Monday's summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### ""Russia-U.S. ties aren't just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. ""It's unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don't meet."" ### Moscow views Trump's criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump's election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament's upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won't engage in vague talk about ""illusory subjects,"" such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia's return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he's likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be ""pointless"" to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea's status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine's push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### ""Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,"" Lukyanov said. ""But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident."" ### ___"

Elizabeth Warren said to Trump in a tweet. ### Warren, expected to run in 2020 after choosing not to in 2016, tied the meeting to the Department of Justice’s Friday indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officers charged with hacking Democratic emails and releasing them in an alleged move to support Trump’s election. ### Alex Edelman / Getty Images ### Republican Sen.

(Alex Edelman / Getty Images) ### Likely Democratic candidate Corey Booker, senator from New Jersey, urged transparency, and said that “Trump should cancel the meeting or make it an open meeting, confronting Putin on his aggression & taking measures to hold them accountable.” ### The call to cancel the meeting was echoed by some Democrats and potential candidates such as California’s Sen. Kamala Harris, though others such as Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said that after the indictments Putin should be confronted for alleged election meddling and “Trump himself should be the one to bring this message to Putin.” ### Though the President has claimed that all investigations into him and his campaign are a witch hunt driven by Democrats, members of his own party also criticized the Putin rendezvous. ### Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, also seen as looking to challenge for the White House in a 2020 Republican primary, said hours before the summit that he does not think the President should be “dignifying Putin with this meeting,” though also said that Trump should tell the Russian leader to “quit messing with America.” ### Sasse added that Putin is an “enemy of America,” a “crook and a liar,” a “KGB thug” and a “murderer” for the deaths of those aboard the MH17 flight shot down over eastern Ukraine. ### Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring after this year but has been mentioned as another potential moderate GOP challenger, told CNN last week that he is “glad” Trump is meeting with Putin but was concerned about possible concessions made to Moscow. ### Trump has said in recent days that “nothing bad is going to come out” of the meeting, though has not given any details about what goals the summit will work towards."

He muses about eliminating them but also has called for a U.S. buildup and bragged about his nuclear ""button."" ### In March, while forecasting a face-to-face meeting on this topic with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said in the same breath that an arms race was ""getting out of control"" and that he would never allow any country to have weapons ""even close to what we have,"" although Russia already does. ### How these seemingly competing instincts will play out in his talks Monday with Putin in Helsinki could profoundly affect the direction of U.S. defense policy. ### Before leaving a NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday, Trump was asked by a reporter whether he would raise long-standing U.S. allegations that Russia is violating a Cold War-era nuclear arms treaty, and whether he favors extending a separate treaty that he has criticized in the past as disadvantaging the U.S. ### His one-word answer to the two-part question was ""yes"" — the first public indication that he wants to extend the New Start treaty, which expires in three years. Then on Friday, he vaguely spoke about how ""it would be a tremendous achievement if we could do something about nuclear proliferation."" ### Yet Trump's administration has shown little interest in negotiating further reductions in American and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. It has been more focused on formulating its own nuclear policy and on combating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. ### U.S.-Russian strategic nuclear weapons — those capable of striking each other's territory — are governed by New Start, which was negotiated by the Obama administration in 2010. It limits each country to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads. President Barack Obama favored further cuts, but U.S.-Russian relations soured after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea. ### The New Start deal is set to expire in February 2021 unless both sides agree to extend it. The Trump administration has been reviewing its position, so it's unclear whether Trump and Putin will do more than agree that their staffs should study the possibility of an extension. Private U.S. arms control advocates are urging an extension, in part because they see value in a treaty provision allowing each side to monitor what the other is doing on strategic weapons. ### Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, says Trump and Putin could instruct their aides to begin formal work on a five-year extension of the treaty, which would not require a renegotiation of its terms or ratification by the legislative branch of either government. ### ""If they don't extend New Start, there is a worrisome possibility that by 2021 there will be no legally binding limits on the world's two largest arsenals, and as a result, all of the difficult security challenges we have with the Russians will become even more difficult to manage,"" Kimball said. ### Analysts have puzzled over Trump's likely approach to an arms control discussion with Putin. The Russian leader said in May that his military would soon begin fielding a new generation of nuclear weapons, including a globe-circling ballistic missile that he previously said could fly over either the North or the South Pole to strike targets anywhere in the world with more powerful and more numerous warheads. Putin claimed it could evade any missile defense system. ### Putin also has promoted Russia's development of a nuclear-armed hypersonic vehicle that he said is more advanced than anything in the U.S. arsenal. Hypersonic flight equates to going Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. The U.S. is working on hypersonic missile technology but has said it fears falling behind Russia and China. ### Trump and Putin seem unlikely to get into this sort of detail, given that arms control would be just one of several topics raised, including the Syrian civil war. ### Even Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, seemed uncertain how Trump would address arms control issues in Helsinki, but he predicted they would discuss U.S. accusations that Russia is violating the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. ### That was the first superpower agreement to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched and cruise missiles with ranges of between 500 kilometers and 5,500 kilometers, or about 310 miles and 3,400 miles. Washington says Moscow is violating the treaty by testing and deploying a prohibited cruise missile. Russia strongly denies any violation and has in turn charged that some elements of Washington's missile defense system violate the treaty. ### Stephan Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, sees room for a Trump-Putin agreement on resolving these violation charges. ### ""You could have verification visits by the two sides to address that,"" he said, suggesting physical inspections of perhaps the Russian missile's fuel tank. That could help resolve the question of how far the missile can fly, while also protecting against disclosure of sensitive missile technology information. ### The list of U.S. complaints about Russian behavior in the nuclear realm has grown longer in recent years. This tension is captured in the Trump administration's updated nuclear policy, which points to Russian reliance on nuclear weapons as justification for deploying new types of U.S. nuclear weapons. ### It warned that Russian strategy on the potential coercive and military uses of nuclear weapons, ""increase the prospect for dangerous miscalculation and escalation."""

The duo will sit down Monday to discuss, I assume, dismantling the current Western powers, the joys of oligarchy-ing, and also how Putin got his pecs, which Trump will probably want to touch. And just as Londoners feted Trump’s U.K. visit with massive protests, Helsinki residents seem super psyched to meet Mr. MAGA—particularly the editorial staff of Finland’s biggest newspaper, which has posted citywide ads excoriating Trump’s and Putin’s combative relationship with the press. It’s not a baby Trump blimp , but it has its own bite, I suppose. ### ABC News reports that Helsinki paper Helsingin Sanomat has commissioned nearly 300 billboards emblazoned with some of Trump’s and Putin’s finer anti-media moments. Messages like, “Mr. President, welcome to the free press,” and “Trump calls media enemy of the people” are printed in English and posted along the route from the airport to the summit site. I assume this is so Trump sees them, though that infers Trump can read, which is optimistic. Here are some of the signs: ### Advertisement ### The signs are also in Russian, a nice reprove of a president who jails and (allegedly) murders journalists, as opposed to merely suggesting they be jailed and murdered. “This is a statement on behalf of critical and high quality journalism,” Helsingin Sanomat editor-in-chief Kaius Niemi wrote in a press release on Sunday. “As we welcome the presidents to the summit in Finland, we want to remind them of the importance of free press. The media shouldn’t be the lap dog of any president or regime.” ### Niemi added, “We want to show our support to those colleagues who have to fight in ever toughening circumstances on a daily basis both in the U.S. and Russia.” ### Finland has been long ranked one of the top nations in the world for press freedom, and in 2018 it came in as #5 on the World Press Freedom Index. The United States landed at a coincidental number 45 on that ranking, down from 43 the year prior.

He is holding previous US administrations and the Justice Department’s investigation stemming from Russian meddling in the 2016 election responsible. ### “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” Trump tweeted. ### Trump and Putin arrived separately at the Finnish presidential palace, about 45 minutes behind schedule. Trump held at his hotel while he waited for Putin, who is known for arriving late to important events, to touch down — drawing comparisons to Trump’s late arrivals at recent summits with US allies. ### Just days earlier, Trump pointed to the “pure stupidity” and a “political problem” in the United States for making it “very hard to do something with Russia.” ### “Anything you do, it’s always going to be, ‘Oh, Russia, he loves Russia,’ ” Trump said during a joint news conference with his British counterpart. ### Trump’s Monday morning tweet and his words and actions in the last week have only amplified concerns about his approach to Russia among US allies and lawmakers of both parties in Washington. During his swing through Brussels and the United Kingdom, Trump has repeatedly criticized US allies, called the European Union a “foe” and criticized the Obama administration rather than Russia in the wake of the Justice Department’s indictment of 12 Russian agents who allegedly worked to hack Democrats’ emails and computer networks during the 2016 election. ### Ahead of his meeting with Putin — who is alleged to be behind the assassination of journalists and political dissidents — the US President also lashed out again at the news media on Sunday by branding journalists “the enemy of the people.” ### Trump again — as he has repeatedly done — pointed the finger at his predecessor President Barack Obama and characterized the investigation stemming from Russian election interference as a “witch hunt.” ### “President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it,” Trump tweeted. “When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!” ### Everything from Russian meddling in the 2016 election to the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine are expected to be on the agenda for their summit here in Helsinki, but Trump has signaled he is most eager to jumpstart talks to “substantially reduce” the two countries’ nuclear weapons arsenals and generally improve US-Russia relations. ### Trump has said he intends to once again ask Putin about Russian efforts to sway the results of the 2016 election, but has signaled he will not press the issue. ### “I know you’ll ask, will we be talking about meddling. I will absolutely bring that up. I don’t think you’ll have any, ‘Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.’ There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think, but you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely, firmly ask the question,” Trump said. ### Trump has sought to cool expectations in the last days leading up to the summit, saying in an interview Saturday that he planned to arrive in Helsinki “with very low expectations.” ### “I think that getting along with Russia is a good thing, but it’s possible we won’t,” Trump said. ### Trademark and Copyright 2018 Cable News Network , Inc., a Time Warner Company.

He has charmed him and egged him on. And on Monday, when Russian President Vladimir Putin meets President Trump face to face in Finland’s capital, he will see what he gets out of it. ### Coming into Monday’s one-on-one summit, Trump faces intense pressure back home to confront Putin over Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, especially following Friday’s indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking and releasing Democratic e-mails. ### In Washington and throughout the West, leaders are also pressing Trump to hold firm in countering Putin’s intervention in Syria and Ukraine by refusing to recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea. ### Advertisement ### But Trump’s weeklong tour of Europe only served to underscore his common ground with Putin more than their differences. ### Get Today's Headlines in your inbox: ### The day's top stories delivered every morning. ### Sign Up ### Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here ### In Belgium and Britain, Trump echoed Putin’s ideological worldview and his political posture. He decried immigration patterns that he said were destroying European culture. He assaulted the media as ‘‘fake news’’ and blamed the American ‘‘deep state’’ and a ‘‘rigged witch hunt’’ investigation for the poor condition of US-Russian relations. ### And Trump’s recent moves to disrupt America’s traditional alliances, both with trade disputes and rhetorical broadsides against European leaders, enhances Russia’s position as Putin seeks to expand Moscow’s influence around the world. ### In a CBS News interview broadcast Saturday, Trump named the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America’s closest allies, at the top of his list of biggest global foes. ### ‘‘I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,’’ Trump said, adding that ‘‘you wouldn’t think of the European Union, but they’re a foe.’’ ### Advertisement ### Trump landed in Helsinki on Sunday night with what he indicated were low expectations and an unusually loose agenda for the kind of high-stakes international meeting that typically is tightly scripted with predetermined outcomes. ### But Trump has an uncommon faith in his abilities to wing it on the global stage. In a trio of tweets sent Sunday from aboard Air Force One, he complained that the news media would not give him due credit for the summit. ### ‘‘Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough — that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!’’ Trump tweeted. ‘‘Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people.’’ ### As in last month’s Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, he is banking on his personality to forge a lasting bond with Putin that could improve US-Russia relations and solve some of the world’s intractable problems. ### ‘‘He’s been very nice to me the times I’ve met him,’’ Trump told reporters last week in Brussels. ‘‘I’ve been nice to him. He’s a competitor. . . . He’s not my enemy. And hopefully, someday, maybe he’ll be a friend. It could happen.’’ ### Advertisement ### In an indication of his friendly posture, Trump said he ‘‘hadn’t thought’’ of asking Putin to extradite the 12 Russian agents indicted by the US Justice Department when prompted in the interview with CBS News anchor Jeff Glor. ### Trump went on to blame his predecessor for Russia’s election interference, telling Glor, ‘‘They were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration,’’ and adding that the Democratic National Committee ‘‘should be ashamed of themselves for allowing themselves to be hacked.’’ ### Ever since Trump’s surprise election victory, Putin has been echoing Trump’s claim that investigations into Russian election interference are sinister efforts to delegitimize and sabotage him by Washington’s Democratic establishment and ‘‘deep state,’’ a reference to the intelligence and national-security apparatus. ### Both Trump and Putin have said the investigations are undermining US-Russia relations and preventing progress on Syria and other problems. ### ‘‘We are well aware of the extent to which the American establishment is being held hostage to stereotypes and is under the heaviest domestic anti-Russian pressure,’’ Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week. ### In Washington, Democratic leaders called on Trump to cancel the summit over last Friday’s indictments. While there is precedent — Obama rejected a Moscow meeting with Putin in 2013 in part because Russia granted asylum to Edward Snowden, who stands accused of illegally leaking US intelligence secrets — Trump decided to keep the meeting. ### Trump has pledged to ask Putin whether Russia interfered in the election, though he said he assumes he will again deny it. ### US intelligence agencies have said Russia is likely to try to interfere in the fall midterm elections, and both Democrats and Republicans have implored Trump to sternly warn him against doing so. ### ‘‘All patriotic Americans should understand that Putin is not America’s friend, and he is not the president’s buddy,’’ said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska. ### Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, who recently returned from a visit to Moscow, warned that ‘‘the Russians are very prepared to argue on so many issues that they’re not in the wrong.’’ ### Protesters have dogged Trump throughout Europe, and about 1,500 people demonstrated in Helsinki on Sunday to promote human rights, democracy, and the environment, the Associated Press reported. ### On Monday, Putin is likely to try to win concessions by playing to Trump’s eagerness to one-up Obama and reject establishment thinking. ### One Russian objective, for instance, has been to win a more accommodating approach from Trump on Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, which included the annexation of Crimea in 2014. ### Putin claims that the Obama administration fomented the pro-Western revolution in Kiev that year in a bid to weaken Russian influence. ### A top Putin ally in the Russian Parliament, Andrei Klimov, described Trump as a pragmatist with whom Moscow can work productively, in contrast to the ‘‘academic idealist’’ Obama who focused on ‘‘irrational matters’’ like promoting liberalism and democracy in places like Ukraine. ### Asked last week whether he intends to recognize Crimea as part of Russia when he meets with Putin, Trump said, ‘‘That was on Barack Obama’s watch.’’ ### Monday’s summit is scheduled to start at 6 a.m. EDT with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö welcoming Putin and Trump at Helsinki’s Presidential Palace. ### Trump and Putin will first meet one-on-one and then be joined by advisers for a working lunch.

But coming amid fresh allegations into Russia's attempts to sway the 2016 election, the sessions on election security have a higher level of urgency and interest. ### Nielsen said her agency will help state and local election officials prepare their systems for cyberattacks from Russia or elsewhere. She said U.S. intelligence officials are seeing ""persistent Russian efforts using social media, sympathetic spokespeople and other fronts to sow discord and divisiveness amongst the American people, though not necessarily focused on specific politicians or political campaigns."" ### The conference of top state election officials she addressed was sandwiched between Friday's indictments of 12 Russian military intelligence officers alleged to have hacked into Democratic party and campaign accounts and Monday's long-awaited meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### Trump has never condemned Russia over meddling in the 2016 election despite the findings of all top U.S. intelligence agencies, and the Kremlin has insisted it didn't meddle in the U.S. election. In the past, Trump has reiterated Putin's denials, but this week he said he would bring up the issue when they meet on Monday in Finland. ### ""All I can do is say, 'Did you?'"" Trump said days ago at a news conference in Brussels. ""And, 'Don't do it again.' But he may deny it."" ### Some of the state officials who run elections say it's important for Trump, a Republican, to take a tougher stance to avoid having the public's confidence in fair elections undermined. ### ""I believe as commander in chief he has an obligation to address it and, frankly, put Putin and any other foreign nation that seeks to undermine our democracy on notice that the actions will not be tolerated,"" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said in an interview this week. ### Some of his peers declined to go that far. ### ""I don't go around telling the president what to do,"" said Jay Ashcroft, the Republican secretary of state in Missouri. ### Trump portrays the investigation as a partisan attack, but not all Republicans see it that way. This month, the Republicans and Democrats on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee backed the findings of an assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election and acted in favor of Trump and against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. ### As part of that effort, Russian hackers targeted at least 21 states ahead of the election and are believed to have breached the voter registration system in at least one, Illinois, investigators say. Without naming the state, Friday's indictment said the Russian intelligence officers stole information on about 500,000 voters from the website of one board of elections, a breach undetected for three weeks. ### There's no evidence results were altered, but the attempts prompted the federal government and states to re-examine election systems and tighten their cybersecurity. ### Federal officials also say it's possible that malware might have been planted that could tamper with voting or paralyze computer systems in future elections. ### The election officials talked about technical details of blocking an incursion. ### Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican, told her peers how her state is using its National Guard to help test and shore up cybersecurity for elections. She said it's important to make it clear to voters that the military is not running elections and does not have access to election data. ### ""The whole idea of this is to instill confidence in voters and the public that the system is secure,"" Wyman said in an interview. ### Some state officials also said Homeland Security is becoming more helpful in sharing information. ### On Friday, a federal grand jury indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers on charges they hacked into Democratic campaign networks in 2016 and then stole and released tens of thousands of documents. The indictment says one of the intrusions came that summer, on a vendor whose software is used to verify voter registration information. The indictment references a spoof email it says the Russian agents sent to more than 100 election-managing customers of the vendor to try to get more information. ### ""The indictments tell us that ... no longer can we deny in any shape or form that Russians were involved,"" said cybersecurity expert Sam Woolley, of the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, California."

The U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can't force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### The Trumps meet Queen Elizabeth II ### Trump flew to Finland, the final stop on a weeklong trip that began last Tuesday, from Scotland. He and his wife, Melania, spent the weekend at a golf resort Trump owns in Turnberry. He was returning to the White House after Monday's meeting with Putin in Helsinki, the Finnish capital. ### Near Trump's hotel, police roped off a group of about 60 mostly male pro-Trump demonstrators waving American flags. Big banners said ""Welcome Trump"" and ""God Bless D & M Trump"" and a helicopter hovered overhead. ### Chants of ""We Love Trump, We Love Trump"" broke out as the president's motorcade passed and Trump waved. ### Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said it would be ""pretty silly"" for Trump to ask Putin to hand over the indicted Russians. ### ""For the president to demand something that isn't going to happen puts the president in a weak position, and I think the president has made it very clear he intends to approach this discussion from a position of strength,"" Bolton said in a separate interview. ### 12 Russians accused of hacking Democrats in 2016 US election ### Trump told CBS News that he's going into the Helsinki summit with ""low expectations. I'm not going with high expectations."" He declined to discuss his goals, but said such sessions are beneficial and cited his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping. ### ""Nothing bad is going to come out of it (Helsinki), and maybe some good will come out,"" Trump said. ### He described the European Union, a bloc of nation's that includes many of America's closest allies, as a ""foe,"" particularly on trade. ### ""I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,"" Trump said, adding that ""you wouldn't think of the European Union but they're a foe."" ### Trump denies criticizing British Prime Minister Theresa May ### He said Russia is a foe ""in certain respects"" and that China is a foe ""economically ... but that doesn't mean they are bad. It doesn't mean anything. It means that they are competitive."" Trump has been reluctant to criticize Putin over the years and has described him as a competitor in recent days. ### Trump sat for the interview Saturday in Scotland and CBS News released excerpts on Sunday, hours before Trump flew to Helsinki. From aboard Air Force One, Trump called the U.S. news media ""the enemy of the people"" and complained that he'll face criticism regardless of the summit outcome. ### ""If I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough — that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" he tweeted. ### Trump also said: ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people."" ### Putin is regarded as having created a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some Russian journalists. Trump regularly criticizes American news media outlets and has called out some journalists by name. ### Trump and Putin have held talks twice before. Their first meeting came last July while both attended an international summit and lasted more than two hours, well over the scheduled 30 minutes. The leaders also met last fall during a separate summit in Vietnam. ### But Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, said Monday's meeting ""is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation and I hope it's a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests."" ### Congressional Democrats and at least one Republican have called on Trump to pull out of Monday's meeting unless he is willing to make Russian election-meddling the top issue. Huntsman said the summit must go on because Russian engagement is needed to solve some international issues. ### ""The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off-the-charts high so it's a good thing these presidents are getting together,"" he said. ### Trump has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling, along with Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation and other topics. Bolton described the meeting as ""unstructured"" and said: ""We're not looking for concrete deliverables here."" ### Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., rejected Bolton's assertion that the indictments put Trump in a stronger position going in to the meeting. ### ""He has already said that he has asked Putin about meddling, Putin told him he didn't do it, and he believed him,"" Murphy said.

1289,cnn.com,2018-07-15T19:32:19-04:00,"It will be the most surreal US-Russia summit in history ### Analysis by Stephen Collinson , CNN ### Updated 7:04 PM ET, Sun July 15, 2018 ### Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. ### JUST WATCHED ### Ana Navarro slams Trump's 'appalling' call ### (CNN) ### Rarely has a presidential summit between the United States and Russia been so badly needed yet so spectacularly undermined by timing and circumstance. ### But there has also never been a chapter in the long history of superpower showdowns and historic Cold War-ending negotiations to match the surreal nature of Monday's encounter between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin . ### Their talks will unfold amid the neo-classical splendor of the presidential palace in Helsinki in a dramatic coda to an overseas tour in which the President has dressed down US allies, been charmed by a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II and continued to rage over the ongoing Russia investigation, just days after the US Justice Department's indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence agents for election tampering. ### There are multiple reasons why it's good for the two Presidents to talk given critical national security issues including the war in Syria , North Korea , fraying arms control agreements and the desperate state of relations between two nuclear powers with the capacity to wipe out humanity. ### If they make progress against expectations, then the President's critics may have to eat their words. Even if the talks unfreeze lower level dialogue, they may be worthwhile. ### Trump tells officials how Putin will respond to meddling question ### Read More ### Yet worthy diplomatic openings will pale against the mind-boggling spectacle of the most unusual US-Russia summit in history. ### After all, Trump will sit down with the man accused of masterminding an audacious election meddling operation in order to put him into office, days after the indictment of Russian intelligence operatives by his own Justice Department, in the Robert Mueller-led probe the US President has branded a ""witch hunt."" ### It's not even clear that Trump will upbraid Putin over such a brazen assault on American sovereignty and democracy -- despite being given considerable leverage by the staggering indictments. ### On the eve of the talks, Trump offered little sign he is lining up big outcomes. ### ""I go in with very low expectations. I think that getting along with Russia is a good thing, but it's possible that we won't,"" Trump told CBS News in an interview broadcast Sunday . ### JUST WATCHED ### MUST WATCH ### Outlining the history of U.S President's relations with Putin 02:10 ### It's not surprising therefore that Democrats and some Republicans question why the summit is still on, especially given the administration's failure to provide a clear sense of the agenda and possible deliverables of a confab Trump has craved for months. ### There are fears in Washington that the winging-it US President will cough up big concessions in a comprehensive mismatch with the wily and prepared Russian veteran. ### Trump's insistence on a one-on-one meeting with Putin without senior aides present has refocused intrigue on his odd relationship with a strongman he never criticizes and fueled speculation he is somehow beholden to the former KGB agent and intelligence chief. ### It's also curious that Trump often appears more in tune with Putin's views than those of his own government on Crimea, the unity of the Western alliance, the special counsel probe and democratic bedrocks like press freedom and international institutions. ### Given the inauspicious atmosphere, it's unlikely that any other President would still be meeting Putin. Trump's decision to press ahead anyway has left US officials floundering. ### Before Trump left for Europe, US Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman said: ""I think the fact that we're having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself."" ### But on Sunday he undercut his own expectations-building. ### ""It isn't a summit. I've heard it called a summit. This is a meeting,"" Huntsman said on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" styling the sit-down as an initial chance to defuse boiling tensions. ### Presidents who can't wait to meet ### With Putin, Trump insists he'll be 'different' ### There is no doubt the summit is going ahead simply because Trump and Putin want it to. ### Trump relishes the pageantry of international set pieces in which he bestrides the world. He also seems most at home with strongmen like Putin, North Korea's Kim Jong Un or China's Xi Jinping, unencumbered by international institutions, allies or America's traditional foreign policy. ### Putin enters the summit on a roll, after presiding over a successful World Cup final in Russia. He can use it to build legitimacy for his autocratic rule at home, by showing that he has restored Russia to great power status after the humiliation of the Soviet collapse. ### As a bonus, he got to watch this week as the President in the United States enacted the core goal of his own foreign policy, carving deep divisions between the US and its NATO allies, insulting America's friends such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Theresa May and deepening polarization in American politics with assaults on the Russia probe. ### And he gets to greet the President in private. The rest of the world may never know the content of the encounter, given their propensity of both men to shade the truth. ### Trump's rationale for the talks -- as he has repeatedly stressed on his trip to Europe -- is that it would be better for the world if the US and Russia got along. ### ""In a sense, we're competitors ... he's not my enemy. And hopefully, somebody, maybe he'll be a friend,"" the President said in Brussels last week. ### In Montana this month, Trump scoffed at the idea Putin was an enemy dedicated to zero-sum combat with the United States. ### ""You know what? Putin's fine. He's fine. We're all fine. We're people,"" he said. ### Trump's attitude marks a sharp shift from the attitude of his two predecessors. Former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both made clear privately that although they had hoped to forge cooperation with Putin, they came to see him as motivated by deep resentment and even paranoia about the United States, brewed by fury over what he saw as disrespect meted out to Russia in the post-Cold War era. ### Perhaps, therefore, treating Putin as an equal of the American president could indeed work and validate Trump's approach. ### But many experts believe that he is underestimating the Russian leader, especially after he said before leaving the US that the Putin meeting would be the ""easier"" leg of his trip. ### For Putin, read Kim ### Trump critics worry that Putin will have evaluated Trump's summit with Kim in Singapore as he seeks to outmaneuver the President in Helsinki. ### They note that Trump offered up a significant concession to Kim -- a halt to US military exercises with South Korea, without getting much in return, let alone a verifiable pledge to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear program ### ""Trump gave up lots of things and got absolutely nothing from the North Koreans except for one thing, which was the one thing he wanted -- enormous flattery,"" said Kenneth Adelman, a former senior arms negotiator at US-Soviet summits with President Ronald Reagan. ### ""I think Putin will be wonderful at this to say 'Oh My God, we had such great rapport, we just get along so well,' -- that is all that Trump really wants,"" Adelman told CNN's Don Lemon Friday. ### There is anxiety in Washington that Putin could convince Trump to hand over areas of Syria to Russia's client Bashar al-Assad, in a way that will benefit Iran, because of his eagerness to get US troops home. ### In Europe, allies worry that Trump could agree to downgrade alliance military maneuvers, even though he endorsed an alliance communique highlighting malign Russian influence and has drummed up extra defense spending by foot-dragging member states. ### And after Trump raised the possibility of recognizing Putin's annexation of Crimea, there will be intense scrutiny of his rhetoric on the issue at a joint news conference. ### The top talking point may be how Putin and Trump navigate the election interference storm. ### Trump pledged Friday to raise the issue, but has repeatedly said he knows Putin will not deny involvement. ### While the indictments handed down by special counsel Robert Mueller on Friday increase political pressure on Trump, they did not change his attitude towards the investigation. ### He is now blaming the special counsel for the tortured state of relations with Russia. ### ""I think we're greatly hampered by this whole witch hunt that's going on in the United States, the Russia witch hunt, the rigged situation,"" Trump told CBS. ### Putin knows the President is under intense pressure and has little interest in seeing him further damaged -- so it's not impossible he could offer a public acknowledgment that some Russian hackers may have transgressed or style the election meddling as everyday espionage. ### Russian officials also often paraphrase the President's own rhetoric in an apparent effort to offer Trump validation for his complaints that he rarely gets from US critics. ### Trump's sometime ally, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, questioned whether demands for a Russian confession were worthwhile. ### ""I think, really, we mistake our response if we think it's about accountability from the Russians. They are another country. They are going to spy on us. They do spy on us,"" Paul said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ### But Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff said Putin was essentially an ""unindicted co-conspirator"" in the Russia probe. ### ""He's the ringmaster of this conspiracy and he's going to be sitting down at the table with Donald Trump and Trump is basically saying that indictment is just a witch hunt,"" he said, also on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""That's a great gift for Vladimir Putin."""

But what REALLY doomed them were her obsession with Rasputin the sex-crazed monk who destroyed a dynasty ### by Tony Rennell ### The disgraceful scene was typical of the sort of sordid events that showed that the autocratic Romanov dynasty, who for three centuries had ruled Russia, had completely lost the plot. ### Fuelled with booze and lust, Rasputin, the Mad Monk of Russia, was on the rampage, dancing wildly like a dervish round a fashionable Moscow restaurant, grabbing at the gypsy girls in the chorus line of the cabaret and loudly boasting in explicit terms about what he had been doing (and would do again) to no less a person than Her Imperial Highness Tsarina Alexandra, wife of Tsar Nicholas II and Mother of the Nation. ### And, to press home the point, he stood on a table, undid his trousers and flashed for all to see that part of his anatomy which apparently had the Empress (and hundreds of other high-born women) in his thrall. ### The police were called and threw the snarling, cursing so-called Man of God in jail. They would have pressed charges if an order had not come from the Tsar's palace in Petrograd to release him. ### Lecher: Grigori Rasputin was known as the Mad Monk of Russia ### The newspapers had a field day with the story, dwelling on every sordid detail. The message was clear. Grigori Rasputin, the Siberian peasant with the mesmeric eyes who had wormed his way into the confidence of Russia's royal family and wielded huge power in the land as a result, had exposed his true self in every sense. ### Yet the gullible Tsar — and even more so his wife Alexandra — continued not only to protect but to idolise this straggly-bearded drunken lecher. ### For many in troubled Russia, riven by social unrest, strikes, mutinies and assassinations, this degrading incident in 1915 was the the historic turning point. ### It could all have been so different. Just 50 years earlier, the Russian empire — so vast it encompassed 104 nationalities and 146 languages — had begun to embrace the modern world. Under the humane Tsar Alexander II, serfdom was abolished, giving freedom to 22 million peasants, and there were social and political reforms, including an elected assembly. ### Hopes were high for the future, too, in the capable hands of the heir to the throne, Nikolai. He had the ability and the personal charisma that might have seen through the careful liberalisation — fusing a mighty past with a changing present — that Russia needed. ### If he had lived, that is. But Nikolai died of meningitis aged 21, and the opportunity of more, much-needed modernisation was lost as the succession passed to his brother, Sasha, a loutish bear of a man who preferred hunting and drinking to intellectual pursuits. ### As Alexander III, he reverted to autocratic rule, brooking no opposition or dissent, and instilled that old-fashioned belief in the divine right of kings to his son, the boyish, slight, rather effete Nicholas. The stage was set for disaster . . . ### A bright, bold visionary monarch might have steered Russia in the right direction at this critical point in its history. But Nicholas, timid and placid to the point of paralysis, had none of those attributes. ### Coming to the throne in 1894 aged 26, he wept like a child. 'I never wanted to be Tsar,' he whined to his brother-in-law. 'What's going to happen to me and to Russia?' He was so useless at making decisions that he couldn't even organise his father's funeral. His cousin, Britain's Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), had to step in and take charge. ### Rasputin poses with Alexandra and her five children. Seated bottom right is the youngsters' governess Maria Vishnyakova ### Events also had a nasty habit of backfiring on Nicholas, even when he tried to do the right thing. At his coronation, some 400,000 packages of food and mugs of beer were laid on at Moscow's equivalent of Hyde Park for his peasant subjects to tuck into. ### Unfortunately, three-quarters-of-a- million of them turned up on a hot summer's day, and in the panicky pushing, jostling and queue-jumping, 3,000 were trampled to death. Bloody bodies were heaped onto carts and driven away. ### Then the new Tsar compounded this misfortune by failing to cancel his own celebrations — the respectful thing to do — and dancing the night away at a palace ball. When this error of judgment was pointed out to him, he reacted — typically — by feeling sorry for himself. Weak-minded and ineffectual, Nicholas was an emperor with absolute powers but without a dictator's temperament. ### What made his situation even more perilous was that he was in thrall to a domineering wife he adored, who railed at him constantly that it was his God-given duty to rule his people with a rod of iron. Live up to the legacy of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great, she urged. Autocracy was Russia's way. Whip them until they bleed and they will love you for it. ### That the 20th century was dawning and times had changed eluded her — but so did many other ingredients of a successful modern monarchy, such as compassion, understanding and good public relations. ### German-born Alexandra, known in the family as Alix, was striking and elegant with blue eyes, golden hair and high cheekbones — but her beauty disguised anxiety that bordered on hysteria, hypochondria (she complained of sciatica and constant headaches) and a complete distrust of other people that verged on paranoia. ### She was haughty. She rarely smiled. She had no close friends but was exclusively committed to her husband and children, living in a bubble that floated above all the troubles that Russia was plunging into. ### As a member of what has been called the richest family in history — worth around £34 billion at 1917 rates — it was certainly a gilded bubble, with palaces, priceless artworks and precious jewels. ### Their homes had fountains covered in gold and they wore clothes embossed with valuable gems. They even had a motor car converted to run over snow with tracks attached to the back wheels and skis on the front, a vehicle greatly enjoyed by the Bolsheviks who eventually captured it. ### However, money could not assuage their worries, especially about the future of the Russian monarchy. ### The birth of a son — after four daughters, the beautiful Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia — was a joyous affair and might have ended the royal family's anxieties about the future. ### There was a male heir at last to continue the dynasty (albeit somewhat unnecessary given at least two of the Romanov line in the past had been powerful empresses, notably Catherine the Great). ### But bad luck intervened here, too. After the umbilical cord was cut, the baby bled from his navel for 48 hours and nearly died there and then. ### Alexei, the Tsarevich, had the terrible, inherited disease of haemophilia. He would have to live his life (probably a short one anyway) wrapped in cotton wool, constantly watched, kept out of harm's way. ### His health and survival became the Tsarina's obsession — more important than the swelling ranks of anarchists, socialists and Communists calling for revolution, mass strikes in factories, cavalry charges on street demonstrators, leaving thousands dead, mutiny in army barracks and on the battleship Potemkin. ### Against Alexandra's advice to tough it out, Nicholas gave in to the mob in 1905, though reluctantly and while damning 'their insolence'. ### He agreed to civil rights for all, an elected Duma (parliament), almost universal suffrage and a prime minister to run the government on his behalf. They were major concessions and two decades earlier might have done the trick. But now it was too late. ### The unrest continued — inside the new Duma where the liberals and leftists challenged the Tsar's authority, but also outside it in councils of workers and peasants called soviets. Radical leaders such as Trotsky and Lenin ruled the streets. ### The Tsar hit back the only way he knew — with violent repression and executions by the thousands. 'Terror must be met with terror,' he ordered. ### It was in that same year of 1905 that Rasputin arrived in Petrograd from Siberia, entered the life of the royal family and quickly became, in the phrase that the instantly besotted Alexandra would use of him, 'Our Friend'. ### The Tsarina, a lost and suffering soul in search of a Redeemer, saw him as the answer to her prayers. With just a word, he seemed (to her, though not to others) to be able to cure the bleeding of her haemophiliac son. That sealed her spiritual pact with Rasputin. He called her 'Mama', she sewed a shirt for him in the compulsive relationship that grew between them. The Tsar looked on benignly, happily accepting almost as much guidance from Rasputin as his wife did. ### He refused to heed the warnings or see the danger in her closeness to this charismatic holy man with his piercing eyes, greasy beard and wandering hands. ### Though Alix wrote to Rasputin that 'I love you and believe in you', their intimacy was almost certainly not sexual. But his lechery — he never learned to keep his large hands and long fingers to himself, casually caressing bare shoulders, and groping breasts and thighs — led to gossips concluding they must be lovers. ### In Petrograd and Moscow, rumour was rife, fuelled by pornographic pamphlets that recounted his erotic adventures. His manhood was said to be a massive 14in and that he could keep it erect for as long as he liked. ### Satirists called it 'the rudder that rules Russia' because it was supposedly servicing not only the Tsarina but her four daughters and mother-in-law, along with their entire court circle of women. ### Whether any of this was true no longer mattered. The monarchy in Russia, already under threat from many sides and in desperate need of dignity and respect, sank ever deeper into disrepute among its subjects, high and low. ### A pro-monarchy MP wrote despairingly of 'this terrifying knot'. Adding: 'The Emperor insults the people by allowing into the palace an exposed libertine, while the country insults the Emperor with its awful suspicions.' ### Rasputin's malign influence grew with every year. He had unhindered access to the royal family's private chambers, simply barging in whenever he wished. ### Alix turned to him for advice on all matters and Nicholas, too, increasingly depended on his counsel and prayers. The Press, banned from mentioning his name, denounced what it called 'Dark Forces' in the Tsar's palace, to no effect. ### When the Great War broke out in 1914, with Russia pitted against Germany, Austria and Turkey, patriotic fervour at first put the Tsar back on a pedestal as leader of his nation under arms. But then bungled battles and massive losses — 1.8 million dead and captured in the first five months alone — quickly took the shine off his reputation once more. ### Deciding to take personal charge of his armies, Nicholas left Petrograd for the front, taking with him, at his wife's insistence, Rasputin's comb to run through his hair each day because, she told him, it will 'help you'. ### But he made the disastrous error of leaving the Tsarina at home to run Russia. She inevitably leaned heavily on Rasputin, who picked her ministers for her, constantly advised on policy and politics and even, absurdly, gave his opinion on military matters. ### Prime ministers were hired and fired — four in an alarming short space of time — and a despairing member of the Duma likened Russia to a speeding car with a mad chauffeur at the wheel. ### But Alix was ecstatic about the situation, writing to Nicholas: 'All my trust lies in Our Friend, who only thinks of you, Baby [Alexei, the Tsarevich] and Russia. And guided by Him we shall get through this rocky time. ### 'It will be hard fighting but a Man of God is near to guide your boat safely through the reefs.' ### But his very presence was the problem. A Russian princess, who returned home in 1916 after three years away, was astounded by how the latest story about Rasputin 'occupied every mind, in trains, in trams, on the streets'. ### A newly arrived diplomat from France noted how every conversation 'always ends up leading to Rasputin'. ### Finally, palace insiders decided he had to go. A group of nobles, led by Prince Felix Yusupov, the husband of the Tsar's niece, and Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, Nicholas's first cousin, plotted his murder. ### In December 1916 Rasputin was lured to Yusupov's palace by the prospect of women and, in a cellar, fed cakes laced with cyanide. The poison failed to do the job and he was shot down with a revolver. The body lay inert on the flagstones. No pulse. Dead. ### But then an eye opened and Rasputin leapt to his feet, foaming at the mouth, and managed to crawl outside into the snow, where the assassins pursued him and finished him off with a bullet in the brain. ### They then shoved the body into a car, drove to a bridge and heaved it, wrapped in a fur coat, into the icy river below. It rose eerily to the surface next day. ### But if his aristocratic killers had hoped his death would save the monarchy they were mistaken. It was too late. The rot that Rasputin represented had gone too far, sealed by Germany's ignominious defeat of Russia in the war. The people turned on their masters. ### As Russia descended into anarchy and rival factions fought to take charge of the government, Tsar Nicholas abdicated — just as Rasputin had predicted. He once warned Nicholas and Alexandra: 'If I die or you desert me, you'll lose your crown in six months.' ### They lost their lives, too, shot down like dogs in a cellar, just like Rasputin had been. They had revered 'Our Friend' as their personal saviour and the saviour of tsarist Russia, too. ### He turned out to be the death of both. ###  ### He came from a noble family - but then the executioner of Lenin's brother began his march to seizing power as Russia's bloodthirsty new Tsar ### by Guy Walters ### With his high-domed bald head, bristling goatee beard and intense gaze, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov — better known as 'Lenin' — looks more like an angry schoolmaster than the revolutionary head of the newly Communist Russian state. ### Sometimes nicknamed 'starik' — meaning 'old man' — the 48-year-old is renowned for his intellect and love of chess. His knack for plotting moves carefully in advance has served him well. ### His position as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, the cabinet of ministers that runs the Russian state machinery, is the result of decades of canny political manoeuvring that has made him indisputably the most powerful man in Russia. ### ladimir Ilyich Ulyanov — better known as 'Lenin' — looks more like an angry schoolmaster than the revolutionary head of the newly Communist Russian state ### 'The point of the uprising is the seizure of power — afterwards we will see what we can do with it,' he said before the Bolsheviks stormed the Winter Palace and took over Russia in October 1917. ### Indeed, despite his supposed desire to rule on behalf of the proletariat, there is something reminiscent of the autocratic Tsar in the manner in which Lenin has taken total control over the country. ### That's not where the similarities end. After all, this apparent friend of the workers is even a member of the Russian nobility. Lenin (it was typical of revolutionaries to adopt a pseudonym to help hide from the authorities) had a comfortable and happy upbringing. ### Born in April 1870 in the town of Simbirsk — an unremarkable place some 500 miles east of Moscow — young Vladimir's father, Ilya, rose to become a well-respected director of education in his province, and was awarded the Order of St Vladimir, which conferred on his family hereditary noble status. ### While his father inspected schools, his son thrived in them. Lenin was a model pupil — not only industrious and top of the class, but also exceptionally well-behaved. There was no sign of the revolutionary ardour or rebellious spirit he displayed in later years. ### However, in 1886, when Lenin was just 15, his smooth course towards professional life was to change. In January his father died, a traumatic event for any boy on the cusp on manhood. ### Worse was to come in May the following year, when his older brother Alexander, a student at university in Petrograd, was executed for conspiring to assassinate the Tsar. ### D Espite his family enjoying noble status, Lenin, his mother and his remaining siblings, were shunned by respectable society. ### When Lenin became a student at the University of Kazan that August, he saw it as an opportunity to get his own back, and he fell in with a group of agitators. After just three months, he was arrested, and when it was discovered he was related to Alexander, he was expelled. ### Back home, Lenin took over the running of the family estate, a period in his life about which little is known, largely because it does not suit the image of an ardent Marxist to have once been an exploiter of labour. For the next six years, he absorbed every article, book and pamphlet he could find on economics and Marxism, and managed to complete a law degree at home, under the auspices of Petrograd University. ### It was during this period he blossomed into a revolutionary. He took a job with a legal practice, but his heart was filled with revolution. In the mid-1890s he gave up his job and left for Petrograd, determined to involve himself in radical politics. ### In February 1897, Lenin was sentenced to internal exile in Siberia for three years. He had been arrested for his part in producing a pamphlet designed to incite the workers to revolution. ### It was exile that prompted Lenin's marriage to Nadezhda Krupskaya, a fierce Communist as committed to the cause as her husband. She too had been born into a noble family, although her parents struggled financially, and she was a gifted student. ### She was also a devoted Christian until, at the age of 21, she turned her back on God in favour of Marxism. They married — in a church, despite their professed atheism — so that she could stay with him in Siberia. ### When his exile ended in 1900, a new period of Lenin's life started. For the next 17 years, he and his wife spent their time touring Europe, forging links with fellow Communists, although given the fractious nature of those dedicated to the cause there were plenty of disputes. He visited London, Munich, Paris, Geneva, Stockholm and Krakow holding endless conferences, congresses, meetings and discussions, in which his intellect and willpower dominated proceedings. ### Bolshevik troops in action ### It was in London in 1903, at a meeting of Russia's Social Democratic Party, that he prompted the split between his hardline, Bolsheviks and the moderate Mensheviks. He has run the show ever since. ### Despite his attempts to map out the whole game in advance, events have sometimes got the better of him. The thwarted revolution of 1905, in which mass uprisings across Russia narrowly failed to oust the Tsar, came as a shock. Wrongfooted, Lenin missed what could have been his big opportunity. ### It was the Great War that finally gave him his opening. During the February revolution of 1917 the Tsar was forced to abdicate in favour of a Provisional Government led by Alexander Kerensky — Lenin was not going to be caught on the hop. ### Revolutionaries began to flock home. Thanks to the goodwill of the Kaiser, Lenin was one of them. The Germans supported him practically and financially because they suspected his revolutionary efforts would distract Russia's military and political leaders away from what was happening in the rest of Europe. ### In this, Lenin has exceeded all expectations. In Russia, he took to the streets, rallying the workers of Petrograd to the Bolshevik banner and whipping them into a fervour with his speeches. ### With the Bolsheviks seizing control in the October revolution — an almost bloodless coup started when the party's Red Guards seized key government buildings including the Winter Palace — Lenin was able to take power, and he has used it to withdraw Russia from the war. ### But Lenin now faces a dangerous civil war. Victory hangs in the balance. He has come a long way, but he has an even longer way to go if he is to secure his command over Russia. ### Whether he makes it remains to be seen. ### Advertisement"

Trump may seek Moscow’s help in eliminating Iran’s military presence in Syria. ### In recent Senate testimony, Secretary of State Pompeo admitted , “If the Russians could get the Iranians out of there, I would applaud it.” So would Israel! ### Although not a participant in the Helsinki negotiations, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu will play a pivotal behind-the-scenes role. His productive personal relationships with both Putin and Trump will serve as a catalyst for any U.S.-Russia deal on Syria. ### Netanyahu talks of his “great respect for Russia for its contributions to civilization and for the courage of its people” in the fight against Nazism. Putin describes their relationship as “good” and “trust-based.” One of his state-run think tanks said, “If this personal relationship…didn’t exist, our relationship with Israel would have been much tenser.” ### The Russia-Israel tactical alliance is an example of Realpolitik, “practical politics” — a pragmatic pursuit of foreign policy based on national interest rather than moral or ideological considerations. Neither country hides its disagreements. Israel is a democracy and Russia an autocracy. Despite holding vastly different worldviews, the trust the two men have cultivated enables them to work together wherever their interests coincide. ### Netanyahu and Trump also enjoy close personal ties. They speak frequently about a host of issues, including national security. The U.S.-Israel alliance is, in Trump’s words , “as close now as, maybe, ever before.” Netanyahu agrees : “The American-Israel alliance (has) never been stronger.” ### Although America and Russia have been adversaries and the personal relationship between Trump and Putin is yet to be defined, both men are pragmatists. Trump sees a problem and wants to fix it. “Practical politics” is what he does and he sees benefits in repairing relations with the Kremlin. Putin, yearning to be viewed as a global leader, recently said, “We are ready for dialogue (with America)…. I think it is long overdue.” ### Three pragmatists whose interests are not always the same, but whose mutual goal is restraining Iran in Syria. ### Putin intended that Iran remain in Syria as a junior partner in propping up the Assad regime, but hasn’t supported Tehran’s provocative actions against Israel or the projection of Iranian power and, with it, Islamism throughout the region. ### Since Russia entered the Syrian conflict in 2015, Netanyahu has directly conveyed to Putin that the Iranian presence in Syria is an existential threat that Jerusalem will oppose at all costs. Once he convinced Putin that Israel’s military strategy in Syria is purely defensive and not to topple the Assad regime, Russia gave the Israelis carte blanche to strike Iranian weapons deliveries to Hezbollah and Iranian military infrastructure across Syria. Putin views the Jewish state as a check on Iranian ambitions. ### Iran is now a thorn in Putin’s side. With the Assad regime secure, Putin believes Iranian military activity in Syria is no longer justified and could threaten Russia’s position there. Despite its continued warm relations with Tehran, Moscow has called for Iran, other foreign powers (except Russia) and Hezbollah to leave Syria. ### Israel’s focus, like Trump’s, is on thwarting Iran — and, to this end, Netanyahu has concluded that Putin is a useful partner. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) observed , “The Israelis have been pushing this idea of getting the Russians to push Iran out.” ### Netanyahu was wise to forge a productive relationship with both leaders. Israel will now be part of the consequential negotiations on Syria, and Netanyahu’s advice will be valuable as the Trump-Putin relationship evolves. ### In “The Tempest” that is the Middle East, Netanyahu recognized the benefit of cultivating a “strange bedfellow” — Vladimir Putin — and his “practical politics” may pay off for Israel and the U.S. ### Vice President Pence remarked , “The winds of change are blowing across the Middle East…old foes are finding new ground for cooperation.” ### As Trump would say, “We’ll see what happens.” ### Ziva Dahl is a senior fellow with the news and public policy group Haym Salomon Center.

Trump tweeted. ### Just days earlier, Trump pointed to the ""pure stupidity"" and a ""political problem"" in the United States for making it ""very hard to do something with Russia."" ### ""Anything you do, it's always going to be, 'Oh, Russia, he loves Russia,' "" Trump said during a joint news conference with his British counterpart. ### Trump's Monday morning tweet and his words and actions in the last week have only amplified concerns about his approach to Russia among US allies and lawmakers of both parties in Washington. During his swing through Brussels and the United Kingdom, Trump has repeatedly criticized US allies, called the European Union a ""foe"" and criticized the Obama administration rather than Russia in the wake of the Justice Department's indictment of 12 Russian agents who allegedly worked to hack Democrats' emails and computer networks during the 2016 election. ### Ahead of his meeting with Putin -- who is alleged to be behind the assassination of journalists and political dissidents -- the US President also lashed out again at the news media on Sunday by branding journalists ""the enemy of the people."" ### Trump again -- as he has repeatedly done -- pointed the finger at his predecessor President Barack Obama and characterized the investigation stemming from Russian election interference as a ""witch hunt."" ### ""President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it,"" Trump tweeted.

I will absolutely bring that up. I don't think you'll have any, 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.' There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think, but you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely, firmly ask the question,"" Trump said. ### Trump has sought to cool expectations in the last days leading up to the summit, saying in an interview Saturday that he planned to arrive in Helsinki ""with very low expectations."" ### ""I think that getting along with Russia is a good thing, but it's possible we won't,"" Trump said. ### Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

Then on Friday, he vaguely spoke about how ""it would be a tremendous achievement if we could do something about nuclear proliferation."" ### Trending Politics Video ### Haitian Prime Minister resigns amid fuel price protests Euronews ### One student killed as Nicaragua church siege ends Euronews ### FOX 7 Discussion: Election security Fox7 ### Johnny Olszewski Jr. talks about winning recount The Baltimore Sun ### Son of Clinton Twp.

It has been more focused on formulating its own nuclear policy and on combating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. ### U.S.-Russian strategic nuclear weapons — those capable of striking each other's territory — are governed by New Start, which was negotiated by the Obama administration in 2010. It limits each country to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads. President Barack Obama favored further cuts, but U.S.-Russian relations soured after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea. ### The New Start deal is set to expire in February 2021 unless both sides agree to extend it. The Trump administration has been reviewing its position, so it's unclear whether Trump and Putin will do more than agree that their staffs should study the possibility of an extension. Private U.S. arms control advocates are urging an extension, in part because they see value in a treaty provision allowing each side to monitor what the other is doing on strategic weapons. ### Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, says Trump and Putin could instruct their aides to begin formal work on a five-year extension of the treaty, which would not require a renegotiation of its terms or ratification by the legislative branch of either government. ### ""If they don't extend New Start, there is a worrisome possibility that by 2021 there will be no legally binding limits on the world's two largest arsenals, and as a result, all of the difficult security challenges we have with the Russians will become even more difficult to manage,"" Kimball said. ### Read Full Article ### Analysts have puzzled over Trump's likely approach to an arms control discussion with Putin. The Russian leader said in May that his military would soon begin fielding a new generation of nuclear weapons, including a globe-circling ballistic missile that he previously said could fly over either the North or the South Pole to strike targets anywhere in the world with more powerful and more numerous warheads. Putin claimed it could evade any missile defense system. ### Putin also has promoted Russia's development of a nuclear-armed hypersonic vehicle that he said is more advanced than anything in the U.S. arsenal. Hypersonic flight equates to going Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. The U.S. is working on hypersonic missile technology but has said it fears falling behind Russia and China. ### Trump and Putin seem unlikely to get into this sort of detail, given that arms control would be just one of several topics raised, including the Syrian civil war. ### Even Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, seemed uncertain how Trump would address arms control issues in Helsinki, but he predicted they would discuss U.S. accusations that Russia is violating the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. ### That was the first superpower agreement to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched and cruise missiles with ranges of between 500 kilometers and 5,500 kilometers, or about 310 miles and 3,400 miles. Washington says Moscow is violating the treaty by testing and deploying a prohibited cruise missile. Russia strongly denies any violation and has in turn charged that some elements of Washington's missile defense system violate the treaty. ### Stephan Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, sees room for a Trump-Putin agreement on resolving these violation charges. ### ""You could have verification visits by the two sides to address that,"" he said, suggesting physical inspections of perhaps the Russian missile's fuel tank. That could help resolve the question of how far the missile can fly, while also protecting against disclosure of sensitive missile technology information. ### The list of U.S. complaints about Russian behavior in the nuclear realm has grown longer in recent years. This tension is captured in the Trump administration's updated nuclear policy, which points to Russian reliance on nuclear weapons as justification for deploying new types of U.S. nuclear weapons. ### It warned that Russian strategy on the potential coercive and military uses of nuclear weapons, ""increase the prospect for dangerous miscalculation and escalation."""

The tensions created a contrast with his efforts to improve ties with Moscow, leading to bipartisan concerns about Monday's summit. ### Back home, Democrats and some Republicans called for Trump to cancel the summit after the Department of Justice announced the indictments of a dozen Russian intelligence operatives for allegedly hacking Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Putin has previously told Trump Russia did not meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ### ""Certainly I'll be asking about it,"" Trump told CBS News on Saturday. ### Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, during a phone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, urged Trump to press the issue, saying: ""For President Trump to meet with President Putin without expressing the outrage of the American people and securing real progress would be terrible for the United States and the security of our election system."" ### Trump arrived in Finland's capital a day early, while the jet carrying Putin, who wrapped up his nation’s hosting of the World Cup Sunday, touched down Monday afternoon local time and the Russian president’s motorcade whisked him straight to the neo-classical palace a dozen miles from the airport. ### Election meddling by Moscow, the annexation of Crimea and Russia’s involvement in Syria were all expected to come up in the first one-on-one talks between the nations' leaders since 2010. ### Facing pressure to get tough on Putin, Trump on Monday blamed past U.S. policies for soured relations. ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" he tweeted. ### On Sunday, Trump sought to lower expectations for any major breakthrough. ### Heading to Helsinki, Finland – looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia... ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 15, 2018 ### “… no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” Trump tweeted. ### While the election hacking issue was thrust into the spotlight on the eve of the summit, other issues awaited the leaders. ### Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman said Trump was ""highly unlikely"" to recognize Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea, but refused to rule out the possibility. ### Trump himself has been noncommittal on the issue, saying Friday during a press conference with British Prime Minister May that “we're going to see what happens"" at the Helsinki summit. ### The president claimed ahead of his summit with Putin that the Russian president would not have invaded Crimea had he been in office, calling the globally condemned annexation an “Obama disaster.” ### Putin has signaled he would like Trump to soften sanctions that Washington imposed over the annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, involvement in the Syrian civil war and allegations of Russian meddling. ### Trump signed an August 2017 law imposing additional sanctions on Russia. The law bars Trump from easing many sanctions without Congress’ approval, but he can offer some relief without a nod from Congress. ### Almost 700 Russian people and companies are under U.S. sanctions. Individuals face limits on their travel and freezes on at least some of their assets, while some top Russian state banks and companies, including oil and gas giants, are effectively barred from getting financing through U.S. banks and markets. ### The two leaders also are expected to discuss a tentative deal to move Iranian troops farther from Israel's border with Syria and Jordan, in exchange for allowing access there to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. ### U.S. officials have worried about the danger of new conflict in Syria between Israel and Iran or Iran-backed forces. The White House also seeks increased Russian oil production—a move on which Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have already agreed—to restrict Iranian export earnings. ### A National Security Council official told Fox News that Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend to prepare for the Putin meeting. ### ""Yesterday I spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump,"" Netanyahu said in Israel on Sunday. ""We discussed security and diplomatic issues arising from regional developments, chief most among them, of course, Syria and Iran. ### ""I thanked President Trump for his tough policy against Iran because since this policy has been taken, we have seen a great effect on Iran and inside Iran,"" he added. ### Putting constraints on Iran could be the top Helsinki priority of Trump and his advisers. U.S. and Russian officials have agreed on a tentative proposal that would keep Iranian forces in Syria 27 miles from Israeli border. ### Fox News' Gregg Re and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Crimea in 2014 have not been lifted, Trump approved the sale of lethal weapons to Ukraine — something Barack Obama did not do — and he has ordered missiles fired at Syrian military sites, openly targeting strategic operations and allies of Russia. ### But critics would argue that’s not enough, pointing to his delays implementing congressional sanctions and frequent praise of Putin’s leadership, as well as the reluctance to act on Moscow’s cyber aggression. They’ve also cited U.S. intelligence conclusions that the Kremlin meddled in the U.S. election in favor of Trump . ### Alexei Nikolsky | TASS | Getty Images ### President Donald Trump  and Russia's President Vladimir Putin shake hands during a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, July 16, 2018. ### In August 2017, Trump signed into law the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, despite calling it “seriously flawed.” He then bypassed a congressionally mandated deadline in January to act on the bill and impose new sanctions on Russia for the election allegations. ### Election meddling ### Perhaps the most contentious issue for the relationship between Trump and Putin is the allegation of interference by the Kremlin in the 2016 presidential election — something the entire U.S. intelligence community has confirmed but Trump continues to dispute. ### After Trump first spoke with Putin on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam last November, he told reporters that he did raise the topic of election meddling, but that the Russian leader denied the allegations. ### “He said he didn’t meddle. He said he didn’t meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One after the event. ### “Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn’t do that,’ Trump added. “And I believe — I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.” ### show chapters"

My skepticism of the official Russia narrative remains so completely unsatisfied that if mainstream media were my husband I would already be cheating on it with my yoga instructor. ### I do not believe the establishment Russia narrative. I do not believe that Donald Trump colluded with the Russian government to rig the 2016 election. I do not believe the Russian government did any election rigging for Trump to collude with. This is not because I believe Vladimir Putin is some kind of blueberry-picking girl scout, and it certainly isn’t because I think the Russian government is unwilling or incapable of meddling in the affairs of other nations to some extent when it suits them. It is simply because I am aware that the US intelligence community lies constantly as a matter of policy, and because I understand how the burden of proof works. ### At this time, I see no reason to espouse any belief system which embraces as true the assertion that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections in any meaningful way, or that it presents a unique and urgent threat to the world which must be aggressively dealt with. But all the establishment mouthpieces tell me that I must necessarily embrace these assertions as known, irrefutable fact. Here are five things that would have to change in order for that to happen: ### 1. Proof of a hacking conspiracy to elect Trump. ### In most cases, it's so basic that unproven allegations by a prosecutor in an indictment shouldn't be accepted as true one need not even point it out. In this case, pointing it out will be seen as blasphemy. Everyone should want to see the evidence on which the claims are based: https://t.co/a10klzbMRS ### — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) July 13, 2018 ### The first step to getting a heretic like myself aboard the Russia hysteria train would be the existence of publicly available evidence of the claims made about election meddling in 2016, which rises to the level required in a post-Iraq invasion world. So far, that burden of proof for Russian hacking allegations has not come anywhere remotely close to being met. ### How much proof would I need to lend my voice to the escalation of tensions between two nuclear superpowers? Mountains. I personally would settle for nothing less than hard proof which can be independently verified by trusted experts like the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity. ### Is that a big ask? Yes. Yes it is. That’s what happens when government institutions completely discredit themselves as they did with  the false narratives advanced  in the manufacturing of support for the Iraq invasion. You don’t get to butcher a million Iraqis in a war based on lies, turn around a few years later and say “We need new cold war escalations with a nuclear superpower but we can’t prove it because the evidence is secret.” That’s not a thing. Copious amounts of hard, verifiable proof or GTFO. So far we have no evidence besides the confident-sounding assertions of government insiders and their mass media mouthpieces, which is the same as no evidence. ### 2. Proof that election meddling actually influenced the election in a meaningful way. ### Even if Russian hackers did exfiltrate Democratic party emails and give them to WikiLeaks, if it didn’t affect the election, who cares? That’s a single-day, second-page story at best, meriting nothing beyond a “Hmm, interesting, turns out Russia tried and failed to influence the US election,” followed by a shrug and moving on to something that actually matters. ### After it has been thoroughly proven that Russia meddled in the elections in a meaningful way, it must then be established that that meddling had an actual impact on the election results. ### 3. Some reason to believe Russian election meddling was unwarranted and unacceptable. ### Highlighting the U.S.’s long history in meddling in other countries’ elections is not #whataboutism , but rather a highly germane point to understanding the context for allegations of Russian meddling in Election 2016, Caitlin Johnstone observes. https://t.co/OZoIzC8vIc @caitoz ### — Consortium News (@Consortiumnews) February 20, 2018 ### The US government,  by a very wide margin , interferes in the elections of other countries far, far more than any other government on earth does. The US government’s  own data shows  that it has deliberately meddled in the elections of 81 foreign governments between 1946 and 2000,  including Russia  in the nineties. This is public knowledge. A former CIA Director  cracked jokes about it  on Fox News earlier this year. ### If I’m going to abandon my skepticism and accept the Gospel According to Maddow, after meaningful, concrete election interference has been clearly established I’m going to need a very convincing reason to believe that it is somehow wrong or improper for a government to attempt to respond in kind to the undisputed single worst offender of this exact offense. It makes no sense for the United States to actively create an environment in which election interference is something that governments do to one another, and then cry like a spanked child when its election is interfered with by one of the very governments whose elections the US recently meddled in. ### This is nonsense. America being far and away the worst election meddler on the planet makes it a fair target for election meddling by not just Russia, but every country in the world. It is very obviously moral and acceptable for any government on earth to interfere in America’s elections as long as it remains the world’s worst offender in that area. In order for Russia to be in the wrong if it interfered in America’s elections, some very convincing argument I’ve not yet heard will have to be made to support that case. ### 4. Proof that the election meddling went beyond simply giving Americans access to information about their government. ### In case anyone forgot: the “hacked emails” contained multitudes of revelatory information about powerful political actors that otherwise would have been concealed from voters https://t.co/PQnOh9V3rW ### — Michael Tracey (@mtracey) July 14, 2018 ### If all the Russians did was simply show Americans  emails of Democratic Party officials  talking to one another and  circulate some MSM articles  as claimed in the  ridiculous Russian troll farm allegations , that’s nothing to get upset about. If anything, Americans should be upset that they had to hear about Democratic Party corruption through the grapevine instead of having light shed on it by the American officials whose job it is to do so. Complaints about election meddling is only valid if that election meddling isn’t comprised of truth and facts. ### 5. A valid reason to believe escalated tensions between two nuclear superpowers are worthwhile. ### The Increasing Likelihood Of Nuclear War Should Straighten Out All Our Priorities | Zero Hedge #ColdWar #NuclearWar #Russia https://t.co/njZ0K22Qnz ### — Caitlin Johnstone (@caitoz) February 6, 2018 ### After it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Russia did indeed meddle in the US elections in a meaningful way, and after it has then been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Russia actually influenced election results in a significant way, and after the case has been clearly made that it was bad and wrong for Russia to do this instead of fair and reasonable, and after it has been clearly proven that the election meddling went beyond simply telling Americans the truth about their government, the question then becomes what, if anything, should be done about it? ### If you look at the actions that this administration has taken over the last year and a half, the answer to that question appears to be harsh sanctions, NATO expansionism, selling arms to Ukraine, throwing out diplomats, increasing military presence along Russia’s border, a Nuclear Posture Review which is much more aggressive toward Russia, repeatedly bombing Syria, and just generally creating more and more opportunities for something to go catastrophically wrong with one of the two nations’ aging, outdated nuclear arsenals, setting off a chain of events from which there is no turning back and no surviving. ### And the pundits and politicians keep pushing for more and more escalations, at this very moment braying with one voice that Trump must aggressively confront Putin about Mueller’s indictments or withdraw from the peace talks. But is it worth it? Is it worth risking the life of every terrestrial organism to, what? What specifically would be gained that makes increasing the risk of nuclear catastrophe worthwhile? Making sure nobody interferes in America’s fake elections? I’d need to see a very clear and specific case made, with a ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ list and “THE POTENTIAL DEATH OF LITERALLY EVERYTHING” written in big red letters at the top of the ‘cons’ column. ### Rallying the world to cut off Russia from the world stage and cripple its economy has been been a goal of the US power establishment since the collapse of the Soviet Union, so there’s no reason to believe that even the people who are making the claims against Russia actually believe them. The goal is  crippling Russia to handicap China , and ultimately to shore up global hegemony for the US-centralized empire by preventing the rise of any rival superpowers. The sociopathic alliance of plutocrats and intelligence/defense agencies who control that empire are willing to threaten nuclear confrontation in order to ensure their continued dominance. All of their actions against Russia since 2016 have had everything to do with establishing long-term planetary dominance and nothing whatsoever to do with election meddling. ### Those five things would need to happen before I’d be willing to jump aboard the “Russia! Russia! Russia!” train. Until then I’ll just keep pointing to the total lack of evidence and how very, very far the CIA/CNN Russia narrative is from credibility. ### *  *  * ### Internet censorship is getting pretty bad, so the best way to keep seeing the stuff I publish is to get on the mailing list for my  website , which will get you an email notification for everything I publish.

The term also captures how Finland, now a member of the European Union, remained officially neutral during the Cold War. It's a status that has involved compromises. ### There are no illusions here about what the biggest threat to Finland is. ### ""It's Russia that's a potential enemy,"" Peltonen said as he showed CNN around a nuclear bunker, 18 meters below ground. ### Finland's historical neutrality and its proximity to Russia made it a choice venue for Cold War era summits, characteristics that have once again thrust it into the spotlight. ### It's not clear what Trump and Putin will agree here in Helsinki on Monday, and few details of their meeting inside the tightly guarded presidential palace have been revealed. ### The Presidential Palace in Helsinki, where Trump and Putin will meet on Monday. ### But there is no shortage of topics to discuss.

President Trump, who says he wants to ""get on"" with Russia, recently suggested he would discuss suspending military exercises in the Baltics if his Russian counterpart requested it. ### Making concessions to Russia, for the sake of getting on, is something analysts say Finland has turned into a fine art. ### ""Finland's approach to Russia is about dialogue and, in extremis, deterrence,"" said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. ### ""Your neighbors trade, your politicians and civil servants talk, but you have to be ready to defend yourself."" ### Engage with Moscow, but also prepare for the worst -- that's how tiny Finland has survived in the dark shadow of its Russian neighbor. ### The United States, with a president set on forging a better relationship with Moscow, could soon follow suit."

Undeterred, the American president was set to go face-to-face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### Trump, who has been trying to lower expectations about what the meeting will achieve, told reporters during a breakfast Monday morning with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompting a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a witch hunt. ### In his tweets, Trump continued to undermine the investigation, and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor. He claimed Obama ""was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it."" ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin's primary mission was simply to have the summit happen. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one-on-one in the Finnish presidential palace's opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will then take questions at a press conference before going their separate ways. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow's attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America's closest allies, as a ""foe."" ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump's jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over ""delinquent"" defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### ""NATO is now strong & rich!"" Trump wrote in a celebratory tweet Monday morning. During his breakfast, he said NATO had ""never been more together"" and said the summit had been ""a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love."" ### Ahead of his sit-down with with Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump has continued to unleash a series of attacks on the media, including as Air Force One descended into Helsinki. ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" Trump tweeted. ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!"" ### ""Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, ""not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime."" ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week — another chaotic stop on his European tour — that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said ""certainly I'll be asking about it"" although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can't force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a ""shameful comedy"" staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn't contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria's border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia's carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level. ### ___ ### Isachenkov reported from Moscow.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) ### President Trump's meeting today with Russian President Vladimir Putin is a pivotal moment for his administration's efforts to deter future election interference efforts by Moscow and other sophisticated actors. ### Trump entered his meeting with Putin in Helsinki armed with the sweeping indictment  of 12 Russian intelligence officers in connection with the hack on the Democratic Party in 2016, which drew the clearest connection to date between the election cyberattacks and the Kremlin. The intelligence community's attribution of the attack to Russia — and now, the indictments of specific individuals involved — can be powerful parts of a country's deterrence strategy. But experts say they could be far less effective if the president doesn't back up their conclusions. ### “Trump's reluctance to admit that the Russians did wrong tends to put a top limit on the kind of retaliation that Russia can expect from a repeat of 2016,” said Martin Libicki, chair of cybersecurity studies at the U.S. Naval Academy. ### Anything less than a strong demand that Putin back off will likely dull the effects of not just the “naming and shaming” approach the intelligence community has taken but also sanctions, indictments and other punitive measures the administration and Congress have levied. ### “The Russians believe that they have carte blanche to do something similar if it helps Trump, and Trump's failure to mention the hack, more than nominally, would not signal anything differently,” Libicki said. “Exposure by the [intelligence community], indictments, sanctions, and diplomatic reprisals emanate from the administration despite what Trump appears to want. But there are limits to what the bureaucracy would do on its own.” ### Indeed, while Trump has said he will raise election interference when he sits down privately with Putin, he has already seemed to dampen expectations that there’d be any breakthroughs. In early-morning tweets Monday, Trump blasted the Justice Department's investigation of election interference and said the United States, not Russia, was to blame for tensions between the two countries. ### President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok! ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018 ### Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt! ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018 ### And on Sunday, Trump told CBS News  that he hadn’t considered asking Putin to extradite the 12 Russian officials indicted by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, and chided the Democratic National Committee for “allowing themselves to be hacked.” And as recently as few days ago, he suggested there was little he could do if Putin denied involvement. “All I can do is say, ‘Did you?’ And, ‘Don’t do it again.’ But he may deny it,” he said at the NATO summit late last week. ### Those remarks stand in sharp contrast to statements from his top intelligence official, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, who just on Friday  compared the Russian cyberthreat to warnings before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ### “Here we are nearly two decades later and I’m here to say the warning lights are blinking red again,” Coats said at an event at the Hudson Institute, a right-leaning policy think tank. ### More broadly, Trump's administration has hit Russian individuals and businesses with tough sanctions as punishment for the 2016 election hacks and other global cyberoffensives. Deterring future cyberattacks seems to be a high priority for some of his top officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who have spoken out in recent weeks about the need to create consequences for aggression in cyberspace. ### “Mixed messages usually undermine deterrence — which is a tough job because, in this case, success means convincing the other guy that hacking doesn't pay,” said Michael Sulmeyer, the Belfer Center's cybersecurity project director at the Harvard Kennedy School. “The problem is that recent history shows that hacking pays.” ### More than a year and a half has passed since the intelligence community released its report saying Putin himself ordered the election interference campaign. By now, Trump should have plenty of information to inform his approach on the issue — and the indictment only gives him more. The new charges detail a sustained operation by officials in the Russian military agency known as the GRU that involved implanting malware on Democrats’ computer systems and stealing troves of documents with the goal of impacting the election. It also names specific agents and military units, one of which worked out of a building just a few miles from the Kremlin. ### But both sides will surely be watching closely to see what Trump says and the tone he takes. “If the most recent indictments do not convince Trump that Russia is squarely to blame and he does not make this issue front and center at Helsinki, he is giving Putin the green light for Russia to continue its efforts this November,” CNN's Asha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent and a national security lecturer at Yale's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, wrote  Sunday. ### From Nicholas Burns, a former top diplomat and Russia expert who served Republican and Democratic presidents: ### Key issue for Trump-Putin Summit—Putin fired the first salvo in a new cyber war against the U.S. in 2016. Trump has never acknowledged the attack, never responded to it. Putin has not paid a price. Trump needs to do his job defend our country. https://t.co/Nb1WCg5kUh ### — Nicholas Burns (@RNicholasBurns) July 15, 2018 ### From a Republican senator: ### A better thing, Mr. President, would be to declare: ""Russia is the enemy of America and our allies, and we will expose and respond to their continued cyber-attacks against our nation."" https://t.co/qNvgGRA58T ### — Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) July 16, 2018 ### Trump is meeting with Putin one-on-one, raising still more questions about the president's exchanges with the Russian leader. Around this time last year, Trump met with Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Germany and emerged saying he and Putin had talked about creating a  new ""impenetrable""  cybersecurity unit to guard against election hacking. Trump quickly abandoned the idea following broad condemnations from lawmakers. There was also some confusion surrounding what the two leaders told each other: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Trump had accepted Putin’s assurance that Moscow didn’t carry out a hacking and disinformation campaign. Trump didn’t say whether he believed Putin’s denial. ### You are reading The Cybersecurity 202, our must-read newsletter on cybersecurity policy news. ### Not a regular subscriber? ### SIGN UP NOW ### PINGED, PATCHED, PWNED ### Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta during a Clinton rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Jan. 30, 2016. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) ### PINGED: The Russian hackers' election interference tool kit included spearphishing emails, keystroke loggers and the X-Agent malware, according to Friday's indictment,  The Washington Post's Ellen Nakashima and Shane Harris reported on Friday. “The indictment also reflects an aggressive but somewhat inartful operation in which hackers used the same computer servers to launder money by using the online currency bitcoin as they did to lure their victims and to register sites they used for hacking,” my colleagues wrote. ### Hackers from the GRU's Units 26165 and 74455 pursued their interference efforts on multiple fronts. They targeted Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's email account with a spearphishing email in March 2016, infiltrated the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee first in April 2016 and later the Democratic National Committee, Nakashima and Harris reported. “On June 22, the indictment stated, WikiLeaks sent a private message to Guccifer 2.0 asking to have access to the material, saying 'it will have a much higher impact' on its site,” my colleagues wrote. “The GRU made repeated attempts to transfer the stolen DNC emails to WikiLeaks beginning in late June 2016.” The indictment says that the anti-secrecy group on July 18 confirmed receiving the stolen data, according to Nakashima and Harris. ### The Kremlin complex, center, stands above rooftops in this panoramic skyline of Moscow on April 17, 2013. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg) ### PATCHED: The indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officials shed light on the GRU, a Russian military spy agency that has been linked to several brazen operations including in Ukraine and Syria, according to the New York Times's Andrew E. Kramer . “From the shooting down of a civilian airliner over Ukraine to operations in Syria and the United States electoral hacking, the organization’s recent history has been entangled with some of Russia’s most contentious actions, analysts and security researchers say,” Kramer wrote on Friday. “The indictment unsealed on Friday singled out two signals-intelligence units focused on computer espionage — one based near Gorky Park in central Moscow and the other in an outlying district near a shopping mall.” ### The Obama administration in December in 2016 and the Treasury Department in March of this year imposed punitive measures on members of the GRU over interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to the Times. “Inside Russia, one of the two units cited in Friday’s indictment, Unit 26165, had a reputation as an elite group,” Kramer wrote. “In 2016, Vzglyad, an online news portal, described members of the unit as being 'able to decipher any code within three minutes and re-encrypt it without breaking away from writing a doctoral dissertation on quantum physics.'” ### Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen addresses the National Association of Secretaries of States in Philadelphia on July 14. (Mel Evans/Associated Press) ### PWNED: Nielsen said there are no signs so far that Russia has embarked on an effort to interfere in the 2018 midterms that would be similar in “scale or scope” to 2016, but she also noted that the Mueller indictment is proof that foreign interference in U.S. politics will face “consequences,” the Wall Street Journal's Dustin Volz and Alexa Corse report . Nielsen, who was addressing a conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State in Philadelphia on Saturday, said that “any attempt to interfere in our elections — successful or unsuccessful — is a direct attack on our democracy and is unacceptable."" “Intelligence agencies were observing 'persistent Russian efforts using social media, sympathetic spokespeople and other fronts to sow discord and divisiveness amongst the American people,' Ms. Nielsen said, adding that those efforts were 'not necessarily focused on specific politicians or political campaigns,'” Volz and Corse wrote. ### The Associated Press's Naira Davlashyan and Angela Charlton also reported that U.S. intelligence agencies have found no indications yet that Russia is planning to carry out a specific interference campaign ahead of the midterm elections. “There is Russian activity, to be sure,”  Davlashyan and Charlton wrote. “But it appears aimed less at swaying the U.S. Congress one way or another and more at proving to fellow Russians that democracy is unsafe — and thereby legitimizing Putin’s autocratic rule at home.” ### — More cybersecurity news: ### The Illinois state election board said Friday that it is likely the state referred to in special counsel Robert Mueller’s latest indictment as having been hacked into by Russian intelligence officers. ### The Hill ### THE NEW WILD WEST ### — The Wall Street Journal's Gabriel T. Rubin notes that Russian hackers failed to hide their tracks online as they used bitcoin to purchase servers and domain names. “Using bitcoin allowed the hackers to 'avoid direct relationships with traditional financial institutions' such as banks that would have had stronger controls against money laundering, the indictment said,” Rubin wrote. “Still, since all bitcoin transactions are recorded on the blockchain—the distributed ledger technology that provides the backbone for the cryptocurrency system—U.S. investigators were ultimately able to link the transactions to the Russian government.” ### — Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry dismisses accusations of interference. “Russia’s foreign ministry said there was no evidence the 12 people indicted by the United States on Friday were linked to military intelligence or hacking into the computer networks of the U.S. Democratic party,” Reuters reported on Friday . ### — Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Sunday said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that he doesn’t see much point in seeking to hold the Russian government accountable for interfering in the past U.S. presidential election. “I think really we mistake our response if we think it’s about accountability for the Russians,” Paul told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “They’re another country, they’re going to spy on us. They do spy on us. They’re going to interfere in our elections. We also do the same.” Paul also said he thinks it is unlikely that Russia will extradite the 12 Russian intelligence officers that were indicted Friday in the Mueller probe. “I don’t think Russia is sending anyone back over here for trial the same way we wouldn't send anybody over there for trial,” Paul said. ### — More international cybersecurity news: ### Trump has called for the fugitive NSA leaker’s execution and once guaranteed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would hand him over. But there’s no sign that Trump is pressing the issue. ### Politico ### CHAT ROOM ### — Peiter Zatko, a cybersecurity expert who goes by the hacker name Mudge, tweeted on Friday that he helped advise Democrats during the 2016 campaign: ### During the last election the Democrats reached out to me. ### I was happy to help and made it clear that if a reasonable candidate from an opposition party asked for my advice I would provide similar counsel in regards to improving computer, network, and information security. ### 2/n ### He said he struggled to convince the people he advised to strengthen their cyberdefenses. ### Biggest pushback, from people now touting themselves as candidates for security advisors to new politicos, was surprising: ### They refused to require 2fa: it would be annoying. ### They pushed back on gsuite to enable document control/access/auditing: another email is too much. ### 6/n ### — Mudge (@dotMudge) July 14, 2018 ### He also said that had been considered for a top cybersecurity position in the Trump administration but was eventually turned down because he had advised Democrats during the campaign. ### After the election my name started to float around inside the Oval Office of the incumbent as a possible option for the “Cyber Czar” (or similar) role. ### People reached out to me to see if I would be receptive. ### I relayed that if I could help my country I would consider it. ### 9/n ### — Mudge (@dotMudge) July 14, 2018 ### PUBLIC KEY ### A security guard walks past a building of ZTE's Beijing research and development center on June 13.

Several lawmakers from both parties have said that ZTE threatens U.S. national security and there is opposition on Capitol Hill to the Trump administration's decision to strike a deal with the company to salvage it. The Commerce Department had enacted punitive measures against ZTE in April but Trump tweeted in May that he intended to help save the firm. “While we lifted the ban on ZTE, the Department will remain vigilant as we closely monitor ZTE’s actions to ensure compliance with all U.S. laws and regulations,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement on Friday. ### — “Pennsylvania officials disclosed on Friday that they recently had to shut down the state’s online system for requesting birth and death records for about a week after someone with apparent inside knowledge made unauthorized changes,”  the Associated Press's Mark Scolforo reported . “State officials told The Associated Press the changes were 'cosmetic modifications' but the intrusion triggered an extensive cyber investigation.” ### — More cybersecurity news about the public sector: ### The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center will be the hub for all projects that exceed $15 million. ### Nextgov ### PRIVATE KEY ### Microsoft President Brad Smith speaks during the panel Economic Development at the National Governor Association 2018 winter meeting in Washington. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) ### — Microsoft wants the U.S. government to regulate one of its key technologies: facial recognition tech,  my colleague Drew Harwell reports . In a blog post , Microsoft President Brad Smith called for Congress to create a bipartisan and expert commission to study how facial recognition tools are used and recommend new measures to rein them in.“This technology can catalog your photos, help reunite families or potentially be misused and abused by private companies and public authorities alike,” Smith said. “The only way to regulate this broad use is for the government to do so.” ### More cybersecurity news from the private sector: ### ZERO DAYBOOK ### Today ### The Atlantic Council hosts an event on Russian interference in elections in the United States and other countries. ### DFRWS USA 2018 conference in Providence, R.I., through July 18. ### Coming soon ### House Judiciary Committee hearing on how Facebook, Google and Twitter filter content on July 17. ### The opening of CyberGym NYC will include several discussions on cybersecurity in New York on July 18. ### The American Enterprise Institute hosts Rep.

Anti-fascist protesters carried signs with expletive-laden insults. Free traders, anti-war Ukrainians, environmentalists and rainbow flag-waving gay rights supporters all vied for attention from the world's media. ### In a city proud to defend the right to protest, demonstrators were scattered about. Some stayed at barriers erected by police to try to register their complaints as the world leaders sped by in armor-plated vehicles for their summit at Finland's presidential palace. ### Recommended Video: ### Now Playing: ### US President Donald Trump said he had 'low expectations' for the summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Finland on Monday.    Speaking to CBS News, Trump said that nothing bad"" and ""maybe some good"" would come out of the meeting.    He added that he would raise the subject of the 12 Russian intelligence officers who were charged by a federal grand jury for hacking the Democrats ahead of the 2016 election.   Russia has repeatedly denied those allegations and has said it is looking forward to the talks as a way to improve relations.    Trump has also said he wants to discuss nuclear arms control, Ukraine, and Syria with Putin.    Meanwhile, protests broke out in Helsinki on Sunday. About 2,500 people demonstrated in support of human rights, democracy, and the environment ahead of the summit.    Finland is seen as a neutral venue to hold the talks as it is not a member of the US-led NATO military alliance. ### Media: Euronews ### Others marched by Helsinki landmarks, far away from the leaders' gathering but in clear view of curious residents and tourists. ### At the city's Senate Square, about 20 male ""pregnant Trumps"" and 20 women wearing pink gags railed against a Trump order reinstating what critics call a ""global gag rule"" that bans providing federal money to international family-planning groups that perform abortions or provide information about them. ### Another march that drew hundreds of people was a mishmash of messages — some supporting German Chancellor Angela Merkel and some shouting ""Fascists go home!""  Some marchers questioned the legitimacy of Trump's election victory since he lost the popular vote. Another sign read: ""A woman's place is in the Resistance."" ### ""I don't think the two people meeting today are going to care whether we are here or not, frankly,"" said Helsinki protesters Tina Aspiala, 43. ""It's more of a global solidarity against a lot of things that are messed up, and I think that that's why it's worth coming out."" ### Some marchers had professionally designed banners while others scrawled slogans like ""Not Welcome"" onto homemade posters or warned of a looming apocalypse. ### On Sunday, 1,500 people marched through the city to promote human and sexual rights, democracy and environmental issues. Organizers for ""Helsinki Calling"" said the protest wasn't aimed directly against the U.S. or Russian presidents but was designed to focus on key global issues. ### ""We celebrate the Helsinki spirit here,"" said Timo Heikkinen, a 50-year-old from Helsinki.  ""And we welcome everybody who respects human rights and democracy and doesn't share fake news."" ### ___ ### Iuliia Subbotovska in Helsinki contributed. ### Most Popular ### 1"
1687,washingtontimes.com,2018-07-15T18:58:40-04:00,"Print ### By Jennifer Harper -          The Washington Times -                         Sunday, July 15, 2018 ### Six-out-of-10 voters approve of President Trump’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland on Monday, says a Fox News poll — including 81 percent Republicans, 56 percent of 39 percent of Democrats. So Mr. Trump ’s got that going for him. Sort of. ### The press, however, has stretched coverage of this high-stakes encounter in all directions — gauging the chances of success, tossing critical barbs at the White House, and in some cases, making a dramatic public plea. ### Helsingin Sanomat, a Helsinki-based newspaper and the largest in the Nordic region, has a message for both leaders when they sit down together. The news organization has placed 300 notices around the host city, advising “Welcome to the Land of Free Press,” in both English and Russian — on enormous electronic billboards in some cases. ### “This is a statement on behalf of critical and high-quality journalism. As we welcome the presidents to the summit in Finland, we want to remind them of the importance of free press. The media shouldn’t be the lap dog of any president or regime,” says Kaius Niemi, senior editor-in-chief. ### Meanwhile, multiple news organizations also wonder whether first lady Melania Trump will be a gracious presence after the aforementioned meeting, as she was during the G-20 summit in Germany last year. Mrs. Trump was seated next to Mr. Putin during a formal dinner, and was seen having a pleasant conversation which included plenty of smiles. The first lady speaks five languages and media speculation was rampant: Was she speaking German or Russian? ### Some news coverage this time around is verging on extreme, however. ### “President Trump is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, and the liberal media were in full campaign mode as they pushed speculation the president was a Russian agent meeting with his handler. CNN’s Brian Stelter admitted as much during Sunday’s ‘Reliable Sources,’ saying, ‘ Trump opponents will speculate that he’s really a Russian agent, having a meeting with his handler, betraying America.’ While he did say that, Stelter also declared that no one could trust the president’s account of the meeting and gave those conspiracy theories room to grow,” writes Nicholas Fondacaro, an analyst for Newsbusters.org, a conservative press watchdog. ### “Stelter kicked off the program by casting doubt over whether or not the president was trustworthy enough for us to believe his account of the one-on-one meeting Putin . ‘No aides, no note-takers. So, we’ll never really know what is said because, really, can we trust either man? No. We can’t,’ he bitterly spat. The CNN host bemoaned about how long-gone were the days of presidents who spoke only in truth and commanded power. ‘But not now. Not anymore,’ he decried,” Mr. Fondacaro recounts in his analysis. ### MATTIS CLEARS THE AIR ### If it’s not one thing, it’s another. In recent days, the news media pushed a narrative that the Pentagon is on clean-up duty after President Trump’s recent NATO meetings. NBC News in particular offered a report quoting “Pentagon leadership” and “one diplomatic official” — suggesting that the top brass was reassuring one and all that all was well between America and its traditional allies. But wait. One member of the “Pentagon leadership” is unfamiliar with this. ### “I just heard about this story that the Pentagon’s in damage control. That was fascinating. I love reading fiction. It was stimulating to read it,” Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis told curious reporters. ### But he’s a fair guy, even when dealing with anonymously sourced reports that are less than complimentary. ### “People are entitled to their own opinion, even if it’s not fact-based,” Mr. Mattis told the press gaggle. ### THE PRESIDENT’S GOLF BAG ### Even President Trump’s golf equipment warrants coverage. ### “Spotted a POTUS golf bag being loaded onto AF1. Red, white and blue with presidential seal, and DONALD TRUMP in block letters. Gold tag attached reads DONALD TRUMP,” noted New York Times reporter Katie Rogers noted in the White House pool report on Sunday. ### POTUS, of course, is president of the United States, AF1 is Air Force One. The simple description is in contrast to a ProPublica investigation released in March which broached the idea that Mr. Trump , or at least his commercial enterprise, was in the wrong in the golf department. ### “The Trump Organization ordered golf course markers with the Presidential Seal. That may be illegal. The president’s company has ordered a set of presidential seal replicas for its golf course tee markers, raising more ethics questions,” the group said, noting that under federal law, the presidential seal use is permitted only for official government business. ### “Ethics experts have long been on the lookout for signs that the Trump Organization would exploit the office of the presidency for commercial gain. Several said that using the presidential seal on the company’s golf courses would fall into this category,” wrote analyst Katherine Sullivan. ### FOX NEWS HAS THE ‘GOOD GETS’ ### Fox News anchor Chris Wallace has landed an exclusive interview with Vladimir Putin after his meeting with President Trump — Mr. Putin ’s first engagement with a Western journalist in over a year. In the industry, this is known as a “good get,” and it will air Monday. ### “I will have the first and only interview that the Russian president will give to Western journalists. We’re going to sit down for a half-hour, no holds barred, no subjects off limits,” Mr. Wallace says. “I want to delve into Vladimir Putin and what he wants for his country.” ### There are other “good gets,” though. Fox News prime time host Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson each will interview Mr. Trump following the meeting. Mr. Hannity’s interview will be presented at 9 p.m. EDT on Monday, Mr. Carlson’s interview will air at 8 p.m. EDT on Tuesday. ### POLL DU JOUR ### •59 percent of U.S. voters approve of President Trump’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin; 81 percent of Republicans, 56 percent of independents and 39 percent of Democrats agree. ### • 33 percent overall say Mr. Trump should not meet with Mr. Putin ; 14 percent of Republicans, 25 percent of independents and 54 percent of Democrats agree. ### •53 percent overall say Mr. Trump has “not been tough enough” on Russia ; 32 percent of Republicans, 47 percent of independents and 75 percent of Democrats agree. ### •35 percent overall say Mr. Trump’s way of dealing with Russia is “about right”; 57 percent of Republicans, 30 percent of independents and 14 percent of Democrats agree. ### Source: A Fox News poll of 1,007 registered U.S. voters conducted July 9-11. ### •Chatter, stray facts to [email protected]"
1693,washingtonpost.com,2018-07-16T05:13:28-04:00,"Politics ### Ahead of Putin summit, Trump faults U.S. ‘stupidity’ for poor relations with Russia ### President Trump attends a working breakfast with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto in Helsinki on Monday. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) ### by Philip Rucker , Anton Troianovski and Seung Min Kim July 16 at 4:59 AM Email the author ### HELSINKI — Hours before meeting Russian President Vladi­mir Putin one-on-one for a high-stakes summit here Monday, President Trump echoed Moscow’s view by saying the United States — not Russia — was to blame for hostilities between their countries. ### Although most U.S. officials argue Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, use of a nerve agent on British soil and aggression in Ukraine and Syria have worsened relations, Trump instead faulted “U.S. foolishness and stupidity,” as well as the expansive Justice Department investigation into Russia’s election intrusion. ### “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” Trump tweeted Monday morning as he prepared for his meeting with Putin. ### Trump is facing immense pressure to aggressively confront Putin over Russia’s election interference, especially after the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officials last Friday and charged them with hacking and stealing Democratic emails, as part of a broad subterfuge operation that U.S. intelligence agencies believe was ordered by Putin to help elect Trump. ### But Trump’s comments Monday were in sync with the argument Putin and his government have long made, which is that the policies of the Obama administration — as well as the investigation into election interference, which Putin repeatedly has denied — inflamed tensions between the to nuclear superpowers. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s official Twitter account liked Trump’s “U.S. foolishness and stupidity” tweet . ### Trump — who has been reticent to criticize Putin and has said he admires the Russian autocrat’s leadership style and strongman image — will meet with Putin at 1 p.m. here (6 a.m. ET) at the Presidential Palace, a neoclassical residence facing Helsinki’s heavily touristed Baltic Sea waterfront. ### The two leaders first plan to meet alone, without their advisers, for 90 minutes. They then will be joined by their delegations for a working lunch, followed by a joint press availability. Trump then will fly home to Washington. ### Trump is joined in Helsinki by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, chief of staff John F. Kelly and other advisers, including National Security Council Russia expert Fiona Hill. ### Earlier in his Europe trip, Trump told reporters he would raise the election interference issue with Putin, although he indicated that he would not be too stern, saying he assumes Putin will deny responsibility, and then they would move on to other topics. ### In another Monday morning tweet, Trump sought to pin blame for the matter on former president Barack Obama. ### “President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!” Trump wrote, referencing first 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and then former FBI agent Peter Strzok, who testified before Congress in a combative hearing last week. ### Trump arrived with first lady Melania Trump in Helsinki late Sunday, after spending the weekend golfing at his property in Scotland. Aboard Air Force One, the president aired some of his grievances on Twitter ahead his upcoming summit with Putin. ### “Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough — that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” Trump wrote. ### And after a week of denigrating the U.S. news media on foreign soil, Trump continued in his tweetstorm: “Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct! This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country — but at some point, it will heal!” ### Trump began his day Monday in this Nordic capital by meeting Finnish President Sauli Niinisto for breakfast, along with their wives. When a reporter asked his message for Putin, Trump replied, “We’ll do just fine.” ### Trump also touted the unity of NATO, saying the treaty alliance of 29 nations that is a Western bulwark against an expansionist Russia, has “never been stronger than it is today.” ### Last week in Brussels, Trump upended the NATO summit with demands that European allies increase their defense spending commitments. On Monday in Helsinki, Trump claimed credit for forcing the hands of his counterparts. “It was a little bit tough at the beginning,” he said, “but it turned out to be love.” ### Putin was set to land in Helsinki around noon local time with fresh momentum after presiding over the World Cup final in Moscow, a tournament that many observers — including Trump — hailed as a success. ### Beyond spreading a positive image of Russia, the World Cup also gave Putin a chance to exercise his diplomatic chops ahead of the Helsinki summit amid a revolving door of visiting world leaders. On Sunday alone, Putin met with French President Emmanuel Macron; Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban; Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic; and Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. ### Last week, Putin separately received Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stoking speculation that Putin would discuss Iran’s presence in Syria with Trump. ### Russian officials have kept expectations low, emphasizing that the very fact of the meeting is an important step forward after years of tensions between Moscow and Washington. Ahead the summit, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov praised Trump’s pragmatism in an interview with pro-Kremlin broadcaster RT. ### “Our president is very pragmatic, very open and consistent,” Peskov said, referring to Putin, according to the Interfax news agency. “He always says that the interests of Russia and the people of Russia are the main thing to him. And therefore he respects the fact that Donald Trump has the same attitude to his country.” ### For Putin, the setting of the summit provides something of a home-turf advantage. Although Finland is a member of the European Union and is a neutral nation, it borders Russia and is familiar to Putin, as Helsinki is just up the Bay of Finland from his hometown of St. Petersburg. ### This vibrant Nordic capital, which in the summertime glistens with sunlight late into the evening, holds significant resonance for U.S.-Russia affairs as a neutral site for leaders of the two countries to meet. ### In 1990, then-president George H.W. Bush met in Helsinki with then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to show a unified front against then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein amid escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf. And in 1997, then-president Bill Clinton and then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin held a two-day summit here to discuss arms control and the addition of former Soviet countries into NATO. ### Trump has said he has low expectations for Monday’s summit with Putin, and heads into it without the kind of pre-scripted outcomes typical at such international meetings. Rather, he sees the meeting as a chance to build a better rapport with Putin and foster warmer relations between the United States and Russia. ### “Right now, there’s no trust in the relationship, and because of that, problem-solving is practically impossible,” U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “So this is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama, and quite frankly some of the danger, out of the relationship right now.” ### Trump and his advisers have sought to temper expectations for the summit, which is expected to include discussions over the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, a Reagan-era arms-control agreement and the prospect of extending a 2011 nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia. ### The president declined to outline his objectives in an interview with CBS News in advance of the summit, and his advisers have said the mere act of holding the direct meeting with Putin is a “deliverable.” ### Back in Washington, lawmakers from both parties have implored Trump to aggressively confront Putin. ### “President Trump should have only one message for Putin (on Monday): Quit messing with America,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said on Twitter early Monday, arguing that Trump should not be “dignifying” the Russian president by granting a meeting. ### Clinton tweeted , “Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?” ### Putin’s allies say that last Friday’s indictments represented the latest effort by the Washington establishment to derail Trump’s effort to improve relations with Russia. ### “It seems to us the opponents of the improvement of U.S.-Russia relations should not be allowed to endlessly exploit this harmful topic, which is being kept afloat artificially,” Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said ahead of the summit, according to Interfax."

With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### Recommended Video: ### Now Playing: ### The Kremlin and the White House say the summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump will take place in Helsinki on July 16 ### Media: Time ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ""I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,"" Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### ""The fact that we're having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,"" said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. ""What is important here is that we start a discussion."" ### Trump has been drawn to the spectacle of the summit and has expressed an eagerness to recreate in Helsinki the media show of last month's Singapore summit when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Even as many NATO leaders made supportive noises this week, the Helsinki summit has raised fears in many global capitals that Trump will pull back from traditional Western alliances, allowing Putin to expand his sphere of influence. ### Back home, too, there is wariness on Capitol Hill, with a number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans urging Trump to cancel the summit in the wake of the explosive indictments. ### But Trump has vowed that he can handle Putin, whom he has taken to referring to as a ""competitor"" rather than an adversary. ### And Trump in recent days has outlined some of the items he'd like to discuss, including Ukraine. Though the president has said he was ""not happy"" about Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, he puts the blame on his predecessor and says he will continue relations with Putin even if Moscow refuses to return the peninsula. ### Trump also said he and Putin would discuss the ongoing war in Syria and arms control, negotiations that White House officials have signaled could be fruitful. ### ""I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,"" the president said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. ""We've been modernizing and fixing and buying.  And it's just a devastating technology.  And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it's a very, very bad policy."" ### But it is the matter of election meddling, including fears Russia could try to interfere in the midterm elections this fall, that could play a central role in the summit talks or loom even larger if not addressed. In neither of Trump's previous meetings with Putin — informal talks on the sidelines of summits last year in Germany and Vietnam — did the president publicly upbraid the Russian leader, prompting questions about whether he believed the former KGB officer's denials over his own intelligence agencies' assessments of meddling. ### Trump repeatedly has cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking of his Democratic rivals and disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise it with Putin even as he downplayed its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think.  But you never know what happens, right?  But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### WHAT PUTIN WANTS ### For Putin, sitting down with Trump offers a long-awaited chance to begin repairing relations with Washington after years of spiraling tensions. ### Putin wants the U.S. and its allies to lift sanctions, pull back NATO forces deployed near Russia's borders and restore business as usual with Moscow. In the longer run, he hopes to persuade the U.S. to acknowledge Moscow's influence over its former Soviet neighbors and, more broadly, recognize Russia as a global player whose interests must be taken into account. ### These are long-term goals, and Putin realizes that no significant progress will come from just one meeting. More than anything else, he sees Monday's summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### ""Russia-U.S. ties aren't just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. ""It's unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don't meet."" ### Moscow views Trump's criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump's election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament's upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won't engage in vague talk about ""illusory subjects,"" such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia's return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he's likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be ""pointless"" to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea's status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine's push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### ""Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,"" Lukyanov said. ""But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident."" ### ___"
1798,cnbc.com,2018-07-16T05:47:26-04:00,"CNBC.com ### Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images ### US President Donald Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin hold a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, on July 7, 2017. ### As President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin prepare for a head-to-head on Monday, nearby superpower China will be paying the most attention to the relationship dynamic between the two leaders, analysts told CNBC. ### The Trump-Putin summit taking place in Helsinki , Finland, this week “could present China with important strategic opportunities as well as offering valuable lessons for its own relationship with the U.S. president,” John Ferguson, director of global forecasting at analysis firm Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC via e-mail. ### The U.S. president’s hot-and-cold relationship with traditional allies, combined with his willingness to open bilateral dialogues with countries known historically for their rockier relationship with the White House, is an ongoing narrative of his presidency. ### Trump’s potential to cede to Putin on issues such as Russia’s presence in Crimea or NATO’s exercises in the Baltic region could, therefore, set a precedent for Beijing’s furthering of its own geopolitical ambitions, Ferguson said. This includes control over the South China Sea and the sovereignty of Taiwan. ### But, any indication of U.S.-Russian collaboration over denuclearizing North Korea , a country with which both China and Russia share a border, could diminish Beijing’s influence in the ongoing saga. ### “China is a central player in the Korean Peninsula, but if Mr Trump can increase Russian leverage over North Korea, it will lessen his need to rely too heavily on China's support,” Ferguson suggested. ### China ultimately unfazed by Trump-Putin summit ### But while Beijing could be paying attention to Trump’s diplomatic style, it is unlikely to be worried by any developments in U.S. economic and foreign policy, according to two other experts. ### For Kent Kedl, a senior partner at consultancy Control Risks specializing in Asia, Monday’s summit will have little impact on the U.S.-China trade war that is currently roiling markets. Kedl told CNBC via telephone that he did not see the U.S. president trying to rally a coalition against trade adversary China, as “Trump’s way is to divide and conquer.” ### China views Russia as a useful decoy while it serves its own interests, according to Kerry Brown, associate fellow of the Asia-Pacific Programme at think tank Chatham House. “China doesn’t see Russia as a geopolitical threat,” he told CNBC via telephone, but instead views the country as a “useful idiot” whose service is “distracting the West.” ### Though geographically huge, Russia’s economy is dwarfed by the U.S.’ and China’s, which are the world’s largest and second largest respectively. This contributes to Brown’s argument that ultimately, Russia is a “marginal player in U.S.-China relations.” ### But for Ferguson, despite Russia’s only “peripheral” involvement in the ongoing global trade war, American openness to strike deals with Russia could inform China’s own approach. ### Beijing’s own hosting of Trump last November was domestically lauded as a success, indicating that despite trade war worries, it considers itself capable of dealing with the volatile president. ### But, “no-one knows the trajectory after a Trump summit,” Kedl said. ### show chapters"

Trump laid out a list of topics for discussion that notably did not include Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. ### ""We have not been getting along well for the last number of years,"" Trump said as he and Putin sat down at the Presidential Palace in Finland's capital. ""But I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship. ... I really think the world wants to see us get along."" ### Putin, for his part, said he and Trump have maintained regular contact by phone and meeting at international events but ""the time has come to have a thorough discussion on various international problems and sensitive issues."" He added: ""There are quite a few of them for us to pay attention to."" ### Putin struck a casual pose during Trump's remarks, slouching in his chair with his legs wide and eyes low. He nodded along to some of Trump's remarks before they were translated, showcasing his fluency in English. Trump leaned forward in his chair, his hands tented in front of him and frequently glancing over at the Russian president. At one point, he shot Putin a wink. After Trump concluded his remarks, American reporters shouted several questions about whether he would bring up election meddling during his discussions with Putin. ### Trump did not respond; Putin appeared to smirk. ### With that, the two leaders gave a quick handshake and their private meeting in the opulent Gothic Hall was under way. Just the two of them, each with a translator. ### The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States — and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea — for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow's aggression may go unchallenged. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming ""many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" ### The summit, which was being closely monitored by rattled world capitals, was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump's presidential campaign. Undeterred, the American president was set to go face to face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian's leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British queen, among many others. ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn't ""expect anything"" from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. Not mentioned: Election meddling or Syria. ### Trump said last week that he would raise the election-meddling issue with Putin, but said he didn't expect Putin to budge on his denials. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### They'll continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."" ### ___ ### Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Ken Thomas and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report. ### ___"

1873,foxnews.com,2018-07-15T13:15:13-04:00,"Trump-Putin summit could improve US-Russia relations -- And yes, that is a good thing ### Expectations and objections for the Trump-Putin summit ### Insight from Jonathan Swan, who covers the White House for Axios, and Michael Gordon, national security correspondent for the Wall Street Journal. ### Heading into his summit in Finland Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Trump has an important goal: improve relations with the world’s second-ranked nuclear power – but only if doing so will benefit the United States. ### “Getting along with Russia would be a good thing, not a bad thing,” the U.S. president said in April – a sentiment he has voiced many times before and since, going back to his days as a presidential candidate. ### President Trump – despite what his critics say – is not a naïve fool who will sell out the United States and our allies and make ridiculous concessions to Putin. And he understands that improving relations with Russia and changing Russian behavior is no easy task. But he also believes it’s worth a try. ### The plain truth is that Russia is too big and too important a nation for any U.S. president to simply refuse to deal with. And because of that, it’s to our mutual benefit for America and Russia to no longer be enemies. ### Sure, our interests don’t overlap enough to consider a wide-ranging partnership or an alliance. But we can work together on some things, even if we will inevitably be opposed on others. ### The truth is, the bitter distrust and hatred shared by many in Moscow and Washington today should have ended with the Cold War. But unfortunately, this didn’t happen. Russia and America now find themselves trying to repair the most broken of relationships. ### I can’t help but wonder if this might have all been avoided. History tells us there could have been a different path, especially for Russia, if a fundamental question was answered once and for all: what is Russia’s place in the world? ### Right now we seem destined to repeat a dangerous cycle of U.S.-Russia tensions reminiscent of the darkest days of the Cold War. ### Does Russia belong in the West, thanks to a shared cultural and religious foundation, joining institutions like the European Union or even NATO? ### Or is Russia so unique that it is a civilization separate from the West, thanks to its large territory straddling Europe and Asia? Does that mean Russia and the West will be locked in a clash of civilizations for all time? ### Having grown up in the early 1990s, I was one of many Americans who cheered for Russia to join the West – hoping to see an end to decades of strife with America and its allies, and a real conclusion to the Cold War. ### This might even be what President Trump himself refers to when he talks about wanting a better relationship with Moscow. He surely remembers a time where the future seemed bright and it looked like West and East might no longer be divided. ### It may sound foolish today to hope for good relations between the U.S. and Russia. But history tells us that the most bitter of enemies can become allies in a fairly short amount of time. Our friends and foes change with the years. ### Look back to World War II – just a blink of the eye in the timeline of history. Germany, Italy and Japan were America’s mortal enemies – and the Soviet Union was our ally. ### No one knows the exact number of people who died in that horrible conflict, but estimates are that over 60 million people lost their lives. Yet today, German, Italy and Japan are our allies – while Russia is our adversary. ### And right now we seem destined to repeat a dangerous cycle of U.S.-Russia tensions reminiscent of the darkest days of the Cold War. ### As he works to improve relations with Russia – cautiously, pragmatically and with his eyes wide open – President Trump should keep five important truths in mind heading into his summit with President Putin. ### First, the Cold War never really ended – there was just a brief intermission. ### A rogue Russia seems ready to confront the West at every turn. From invading parts of its old empire twice, to rebuilding its military might over the last decade, to attacking the foundations of our democracy through cyberwarfare, Moscow has made it clear: it will pursue its interests with great vigor – and isn’t afraid to take on America. ### Second, the breakup of the Soviet Union was the geopolitical event of the last 50 years. ### The Soviet flag stopped flying over the Kremlin on Christmas Day, 1991. That was a historic Christmas present to our nation – the ultimate victory for us and our allies. ### We should recall how the left cheered when President Obama tried to reset U.S.-Russia ties. They should, at the very least, give President Trump the space to see what is possible. ### But the breakup still leaves the most bitter of tastes in most Russians mouths. Think how most Americans would feel if our nation suddenly broke up into 15 separate countries, as the Soviet Union did. How could this be anything but a traumatic experience? ### One of the most powerful empires of all time died overnight, leaving Russia economically broken and beaten – a nation that experienced one of the most rapid collapses in all of human history. ### There is a bitterness in the hearts of many of Russia’s leaders, including Putin. A quest to reclaim past glory is clearly on his mind. And history tells us that can be a very dangerous thing indeed. ### Third, no matter what those on the left say, America is clearly in a commanding position in any confrontation with Russia. ### Russia is in a state of relative decline that won’t be easy to halt. Its economy is a tinderbox, thanks to Western economic sanctions, poor planning, and oligarchs who are more inclined to fill their own pockets than turn Russia into the economic powerhouse it should be. ### As Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., pointed out some years ago, Russia is more of a giant gas station than anything else, with no global brands or truly innovative products to sell or showcase. ### With declining demographics and real questions over who will succeed Putin when he leaves office, Russia is clearly a troubled state – and no match for a resurgent America. ### Fourth, despite a history of rocky relations with the U.S. going back to the Russian Revolution in 1917, there are areas of shared interest for our two nations to build on. ### For example, both nations should work to end conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, which have been the cause of recent tensions in the U.S.-Russia relationship. ### Moscow and Washington also have clear reasons to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) , which is set to expire in the next few years. ### Both nations should also work together to establish rules of the road and a clear set of norms in cyberspace. Neither side has any interest in seeing conflicts waged on the Internet break out into a shooting war between nuclear superpowers. ### Fifth, Washington must view the U.S.-Russia relationship in the context of a rising China – the true threat to America’s national interest for decades to come. ### Moscow and Beijing share strong ties now. But over the long term, Russia is surely concerned about the future, as China grows ever stronger on its doorstep. ### As China become more powerful and prosperous, it has sought to undo the post-World War II order in Asia. China feels that arrangement is outdated because it was crafted when China was weak and broken, part of a century of humiliation that must be atoned for. ### From claiming parts of the sea as its own “blue-water territory,” trying to subjugate and diminish Taiwan’s democracy, and using its newfound economic military muscle to dominate Asia, Beijing seeks to turn the vast Indo-Pacific region into its own sphere of influence. ### China, at some point, could turn its attention to the nearly empty stretches of land in Russia’s Far East , some of which were part of Chinese empires of the past . With vast tracts of land filled with nearly limitless natural resources on Beijing’s doorstep, Moscow would be wise to be wary – and consider stronger ties with America as an insurance policy of sorts. ### As China and America buried decades of strife to take on the Soviet Union, we may someday see Moscow and Washington work together in the same way to contain Beijing’s future aspirations. ### Finally, no matter what happens at the Trump-Putin summit Monday, all Americans should be rooting for President Trump. All of us benefit when there is dialogue between even the most bitter of adversaries – especially ones that have thousands of nuclear warheads that could turn our planet into atomic ash. ### We should recall how the left cheered when President Obama tried to reset U.S.-Russia ties. They should, at the very least, give President Trump the space to see what is possible. But we know they won’t. And that is a real shame."

(Jorge Silva/Reuters) ### President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in Helsinki on Monday for a highly anticipated summit that could cool or raise tensions between the two world leaders. ### On the table: Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the ongoing militarization of Crimea and working through “a range of national security issues,” in the words of White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders — all set against the ongoing probe into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia. ( On Friday , special counsel Robert S. Mueller III filed an indictment charging 12 Russian intelligence officers with conspiring to hack Democrats before the election. Multiple lawmakers called on Trump to cancel the summit if he is not prepared to hold Putin accountable.) ### But Helsinki has been the backdrop for these meetings before, some more fruitful than others. ### Through the height of the Cold War to the post-Soviet era, three other presidents have ventured to Finland — which stayed neutral during the Cold War and is not a member of NATO — to host a Washington-meets-Moscow tete-a-tete. ### 1975: Gerald Ford and Leonid Brezhnev ### Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, second from left, poses with U.S. President Gerald Ford during their first private meeting in Helsinki on July 31, 1975. On the left, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and on the right, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. (Getty Images/AFP) ### Ford and Brezhnev came to Helsinki during the high point of detente, an era of de-escalation during the Cold War. Thirty-five European heads of state convened at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to sign the Helsinki Accords, which sought to ease relations between Europe’s eastern and western blocs by recognizing the legitimacy of its postwar boundaries. ### In meetings, Ford and Brezhnev discussed strategic weaponry, but, as the New York Times reported, “reached no specific agreements on means to limit nuclear arms.” Then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger even said “it would be incorrect to claim any particular achievements” on arms restrictions after a two-hour session. ### Of course, not all of Ford and Brezhnev’s conversations were relayed to the press, as noted by Jan M. Lodal in the Atlantic last year . Lodal served on Ford’s policy team as an arms-control expert at the summit. Lodal kept a close eye on Brezhnev — who he was talking to, how he was acting. At one moment, Lodal saw Brezhnev draw a pill from his pocket, then discard the thin pill wrapper into his ashtray. ### If he could get his hands on that wrapper, Lodal wrote, maybe the Americans could pinpoint any health problems the Russian leader was keeping under wraps. ### Lodal said he then watched as Brezhnev’s interpreter handed Brezhnev a small sheet of paper. After giving it a careful read, Brezhnev tore the paper to bits and dumped the shards into his ashtray. ### Lodal’s interest was piqued. After the Soviet delegation cleared the room, Lodal emptied Brezhnev’s ashtray into his pocket. ### The pill wrapper left no traces of medication, but the torn-up sheet of paper revealed a secret of its own: a word-for-word conversation between Ford and Brezhnev in which the Russian leader offered his government’s support for Ford’s reelection. ### “I wish to tell you confidentially and completely frankly that we in the Soviet leadership are supporters of your election as president to a new term as well,” Brezhnev said . “And we for our part will do everything we can to make that happen.” ### 1990: George H.W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev ### U.S. President George H.W. Bush holds a framed cartoon presented to him by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in Helsinki on Sept. 9, 1990. (Doug Mills/AP) ### In August — one month before the summit — Iraq invaded Kuwait, prompting Bush to impose economic sanctions on Saddam Hussein’s government and join an international coalition urging Iraqi troops to withdraw from Kuwait. ### Still, Gorbachev arrived at the summit burdened by the USSR’s deteriorating economic situation. The first Gulf War loomed. ### As The Post’s Dan Balz reported in September 1990, Bush and Gorbachev agreed to sanction Iraq, and Bush supported Gorbachev’s reforms within the crumbling USSR. At the start of the summit, Bush said that if nations around the world could “isolate Iraq and deny Saddam the fruits of aggression, we will set in place the cornerstone of an international order, more peaceful, stable and secure than any that we have known.” ### Before returning home, both Bush and Gorbachev warned Hussein that they would go beyond economic sanctions if Iraq remained in Kuwait. Bush raised the possibility of military intervention, while Gorbachev said he would aim for a political solution before putting boots on the ground. ### The dialogue marked an unprecedented show of cooperation between two nations that for decades had seemed on the brink of war. Too little, too late: The Soviet Union collapsed the following year. ### 1997: Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin ### Russian President Boris Yeltsin, left, and U.S. President Bill Clinton shake hands at the presidential palace in Helsinki on March 20, 1997. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) ### At the start of the two-day summit, Yeltsin said he and Clinton must “depart as friends as we’ve done in the past.” ### It was a promising start to talks, washed down with wine, champagne, salmon and reindeer in the presidential palace, according to the Times. Yeltsin and Clinton had met 11 times before and arrived in Helsinki to discuss arms control and the inclusion of former Soviet bloc nations into NATO. ### Yeltsin argued that NATO’s eastward expansion was a mistake but said he could not realistically stand in the way. He and Clinton agreed to negotiate a new arms-control treaty that would cut back the number of deployed strategic warheads over the coming decade. Clinton also agreed to give Russia a more legitimate role in the Group of Seven global powerhouse of industrialized nations. ### Then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright championed “historic progress” toward European security, nuclear arms reduction and economic cooperation with Russia. ### And she hinted at the spirit of Helsinki summits, past, present and, perhaps, future. ### “What we have seen today is an exercise in statesmanship at the highest levels — two presidents who have not agreed on everything,” she said, “but have showed true leadership and cemented their cooperation.” ### Read more Retropolis:"

Now it’s Trump’s turn. ### Russians have borne the weight of failed leadership for so long that it’s hard to blame them for their stooped backs and acquiescence. Trump should stand up for them, though. If he cooperates in Putin’s charade by treating the Russian president as an important world leader — not just an annoying one — Trump will be complicit in the exploitation of the Russian people.

Glasser ### 7:37 A.M. ### Trump’s tweet seemed to confirm the worst fears of those who worried that the President came to Helsinki determined to make friends with Putin. ### Photograph by Mikhail Metzel / TASS via Getty ### President Donald Trump has set the stage for this historic meeting, the first formal session between U.S. and Russian leaders since Putin’s illegal annexation of Crimea, in 2014, in an extraordinary way, tweeting this morning, “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” The President’s decision to blame hostile relations between the two Cold War adversaries on his own country was quickly noted by the Russian side, and the tweet was even liked by the official account of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Blame America First,” tweeted a piqued former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, in response. No matter what else it accomplishes, this meeting in Helsinki will undoubtedly count as the first such session in which Kremlinology has morphed into Twitterology for the thousands of journalists gathered here to interpret the proceedings based on the sparse information that has been officially handed out. ### Trump’s tweet ignored history and facts on so many levels, and seemed to confirm the worst fears of those in many parties who worried that the American President came to Helsinki determined to make friends with Putin, rather than hold him to account for actions that range from the Russian incursion into Ukraine to election meddling in the United States. They didn’t even need to speculate about Trump’s intentions: he openly broadcast them in the days leading up to the meeting, in a series of statements to the press in which he mused about the positive “relationship” he hoped to build with Putin, while excoriating allies and blasting the European Union as a “foe” of the United States. ### As for the agenda, it remains a mystery, with none of the standard “deliverables” in place that would normally be negotiated well in advance of such a meeting. Speculative reports have emerged that Trump and his advisers have been debating whether to pursue an agreement with Putin on Syria that would presumably involve a reduced American presence in the country in exchange for a Russian commitment to pressure Iran to reduce its military presence there. But then again, no one really knows, and that’s the point for this American President: all eyes must remain on him, or at least his Twitter account. ### Susan B.  ### Sign up for our daily newsletter and get the best of The New Yorker in your in-box. ### Go"

But their summit Monday in Helsinki, the seaside capital of Finland, promises to outdo their past face-to-face encounters. ### For starters, Trump and Putin are meeting at Finland's Presidential Palace that overlooks the Baltic Sea instead of in a sparsely decorated, windowless room in a bustling convention hall. ### Trump and Putin will first meet one on one before they are joined by aides for an expanded discussion that extends into lunch. The leaders are expected to take questions from journalists at the conclusion of the summit, which would mark the first time they have done so together. ### Trump has insisted on the meeting, saying it will be a ""good thing"" if sitting down with Russia's leader improves relations between the U.S. and Russia. But Trump's efforts to meet have been complicated by a continuing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and skepticism about his outreach to Putin. ### ""I don't know him. I met him twice, maybe three times. Two-and-a-half times,"" Trump said last week in Britain. ""If we could develop a relationship which is good for Russia, good for us, good for everybody, that would be great."" ### A look at Trump's past meetings with Putin. ### JULY 2017, in GERMANY: ### Just half an hour had been blocked out for Trump and Putin to meet in Hamburg, Germany, during a summit of leaders of the world's largest economies. The presidents ended up talking for more than two hours. Midway through, Melania Trump was sent in to help wrap things up. Trump and Putin continued to talk for another hour. ### The U.S. said Trump opened the meeting by pressing Putin on Russian election meddling and that Putin denied being involved. ### Putin said they discussed Ukraine, Syria and other issues, including terrorism and cybersecurity. They also discussed the nuclear threat from North Korea. ### ___ ### JULY 2017, also in GERMANY: ### Trump and Putin had a second conversation during a leaders' dinner on the same day as their first meeting, though the fact that they had spoken again was not disclosed in real time. ### The White House and National Security Council later confirmed the evening conversation after it became public knowledge. The meal was hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and was open only to leaders and their spouses, along with one translator per couple. ### The White House played down the ""meeting,"" stressing that Trump spoke with many leaders during the meal. Officials said he spoke again with Putin as the event was ending because the Russian president was seated next to Mrs. Trump. Trump also spoke to Putin using Russia's translator; the U.S. translator did not speak Russian. ### But Ian Bremmer, a foreign affairs columnist and president of a consulting firm, said Trump and Putin spoke for nearly an hour, based on reports from two people who attended the dinner. ### ___ ### NOVEMBER 2017, in VIETNAM: ### Trump and Putin were expected to hold formal talks while both attended the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang. But shortly before Air Force One landed in Vietnam, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced there would be no such meeting after all. She blamed scheduling conflicts. ### The lack of a formal meeting didn't keep Trump and Putin from interacting.

Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. ### President Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg on July 7, 2017. They will meet Monday in Helsinki. (Evan Vucci/AP) ### Since his reelection in March, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s public approval has slipped , according to a state-controlled polling service. This month, the Kremlin moved to raise the retirement age — an unpopular measure that even the World Cup fever in host nation Russia couldn’t conceal. Russia’s economy is stagnant, with low growth predicted through 2020. Western sanctions, imposed after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, have taken a toll by limiting Russian banks’ access to international financing. The Kremlin has had to dip into its foreign currency reserves, and the Russian central bank has had to shore up the nation’s banking sector, which increasingly looks like a Ponzi scheme. ### Abroad, Crimea remains firmly under Russian control, but according to one Ukrainian poll, only 8 percent of Ukrainians have a positive view of Russia’s political leadership. Russian intervention has kept Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in power but hasn’t produced peace in Syria’s civil war. Despite the West’s internal tensions — on display at the recent NATO summit, as President Trump traded barbs with European leaders — Russia’s position is insecure. ### To appease his public, Putin needs Trump — and Russia needs the United States — more than Trump and the United States need him. But from the way Trump deals with Putin, you’d never know it. ### In “ The Art of the Deal ,” in a section titled “ Use Your Leverage ,” Trump starts out with, “The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.” But in the past two weeks alone, he  appeared to open the door to recognizing Crimea’s annexation, told a campaign rally crowd that “Putin’s fine, he’s fine, we’re all fine,” and said , in advance of his summit with Putin, “perhaps we’ll talk about” ending NATO military exercises in the Baltics. Trump’s heaping praise on Putin, his stoking of an artificial crisis at NATO, and his Sun interview undercutting the authority of British Prime Minister Theresa May play right into Putin’s hands and suggest that he’s keen to gain Putin’s favor. On Friday, the Justice Department announced the indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officers on charges of interference in the 2016 election, but this has not derailed the summit. Taken together, these moves look like an effort to approach Putin with a conciliatory tone belying the leverage Trump and his administration have in dealing with Putin, if the president chose to use it. ### Consider that in addition to sanctions, the United States has significant economic and military leverage at its disposal. At the NATO summit, Trump singled out Germany as “ captive to Russia ,” referencing Nord Stream 2 — a planned Russian pipeline project that would increase European dependence on Russia gas. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline would deliver Russian gas through the Baltic Sea, transiting through Germany. It would effectively allow Russia to bypass Ukraine as a transit route, cutting Ukraine off from billions of dollars in transit fees . Even before Trump railed against the project, Trump administration officials signaled that the United States would consider sanctioning companies involved in the project over concerns about European energy security. Such a move would effectively kill the pipeline, costing the main stakeholder — Russian state-controlled Gazprom — billions in investments and lost revenue. Russia’s vulnerable economy would feel the hit. ### Trump is fresh from a NATO summit that, despite his fuming over European defense spending, made significant strides in deterring Russia. While only eight European countries currently meet the 2-percent-of-GDP benchmark for defense spending, according to the 2018 NATO communique, “two-thirds of Allies have national plans in place to spend 2% of their Gross Domestic Product on defence by 2024.” The communique, signed by all members, including the United States, contained strong language affirming NATO support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and condemning the “illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea,” which the allies vowed not to recognize. At the top of the Kremlin’s list of complaints is NATO’s growth and increased U.S. forward presence in the Baltic States and Eastern Europe. Putin will probably raise these grievances to Trump, but Trump should not bend: Ensuring European security through NATO is the greatest deterrent against Russian aggression. When he’s face to face with Putin, rather than entertaining his long-held concerns about NATO, Trump should emphasize NATO’s unity and the common transatlantic stance on Ukraine. ### [ I’ve been in meetings with Putin. Here’s what Trump can expect. ] ### Putin knows that he needs to deliver a deal to Trump so that the president can declare the one-on-one summit a success. With that in mind probably, Putin has stepped up efforts to mediate a deal on a pullback of Iranian forces from the Israeli border — a demand made by Israel and the United States. According to a Bloomberg News  report , the agreement would replace Iranian militias with Syrian government forces, which is less objectionable to Israel. To broker the agreement, Putin met a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the day after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But Russia’s ability to enforce such a deal is limited, as Russia would probably have to commit ground troops to monitor and enforce the arrangement — something Putin will be unwilling to do at a time when his popularity is shaky. Trump should remain skeptical of Russians bearing gifts. The Middle East deal looks less like a real deliverable and more like Kabuki theater. Rather than being taken in by Putin’s promises and repeating the mistake President Barack Obama made when he accepted Russian assurances on Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal, Trump should be aware that Russia will not take any steps to endanger its alliance with Iran. Until that changes, U.S. and Russian interests in the Middle East will be at odds. ### Ultimately, Putin sees Trump as a potential gateway for achieving what has alluded him with past presidents: American acceptance of Russian influence in what it considers its “near abroad” and a return to business as usual, despite Russian occupation of Crimea, war in Ukraine’s Donbas region, interference in U.S. and European elections, Russian violations of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, Russia’s cultivation of Syria as a client state and other acts, such as the heinous, widely reported nerve agent attack in the United Kingdom that NATO assessed was “highly likely that the Russian Federation was responsible for” with “no plausible alternative explanation.” ### Business as usual would mean an end to sanctions, return of Russian diplomatic properties in the United States (some confiscated by order of Obama, some by Trump) and renewed bilateral dialogue on arms control and nuclear nonproliferation. Putin probably also dreams of the United States scaling back its security and defense commitment to Europe, which would leave the continent more vulnerable to Russian influence. These are all things that Trump has and Putin wants. With the Justice Department indictments adding extra political pressure on the summit, Putin is unlikely to get these concessions in Helsinki, but if he’s playing a long game, Helsinki is just the beginning. If he eventually convinces Trump that the U.S. stance toward Russia should be softened to match the kind words the president has offered about him, he will be closer to extending Russian influence in Europe and weakening America’s. ### [ On Russian state TV, Putin has already won the summit with Trump ] ### And that is Putin’s motivation for the summit: Just meeting with Trump is already a win for him at home, showing Putin on an equal footing with the American president, making joint decisions about global affairs. With Russia’s continued information warfare against democracies, European allies have been frustrated with Trump’s solicitous behavior toward Putin. Despite the policy successes of the NATO summit, allies are nervous that Trump will be swayed by the warm relationship building between him and Putin and go back on his commitments to Europe. ### Trump doesn’t appear to appreciate that Putin has to keep an eye on his own domestic politics. It might seem strange to think of someone in power for 18 years as either president or prime minister, widely seen as an authoritarian who wants to be president for life, as someone concerned about approval ratings. And, clearly, data is limited and not always reliable when it comes to public opinion in Russia. But the Kremlin has learned that aggressive foreign policy can deliver big wins at home: In 2014, Russia’s annexation of Crimea gave Putin a major boost in approval ratings. He was already at 84 percent before Russia’s Syria intervention in 2015, and he still got a 4 percent boost. When ratings start to slip — even slightly, as they have recently — many in Europe worry that another act of aggression will be quick to follow. ### Rather than trying to curry favor with Putin, Trump should realize that it’s Putin who needs to curry favor with him. Russia is in a weak position, and Trump should take advantage of this weakness — as he has done with European allies. At a minimum, he should avoid weakening his own position by encouraging Putin to grasp for more than he already has. We know Putin knows how to play this game. Trump calls himself the ultimate dealmaker. He should put some of his professed skill to use by withholding the concessions that Putin desires. It’s too late to withhold a face-to-face meeting, but he could double down on sanctions, increasing the cost to Russians of Putin’s Ukraine policy, and (though unlikely) he could confront the Russian president on election interference. If Trump treats this summit as transactional, it’s an opportunity to see what Russia, not the United States or its allies, is willing to do to, as he says, “ get along .” ### Alina Polyakova Alina Polyakova is the David M.

The Finnish capital hosted numerous Cold War-era negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, and both presidents are eager to portray themselves as the leaders of two superpowers prepared to make their mark on history. But while the location and parties involved might be familiar, the similarities between the upcoming meeting in Finland and its Cold War antecedents stop there. ### Unlike past U.S. presidents that came to Helsinki as ambassadors for the Western world, Trump comes as the man who is throwing it into chaos. Before departing for his European trip earlier this week, Trump quipped that his sit-down with the Russian president “may be the easiest of them all.” The meetings that preceded it were certainly difficult. While the final communiqué from the NATO summit contained unified and tough language against Russia ahead of the meeting in Finland, much of that has been undercut by Trump’s own behavior and rhetoric. The NATO summit was by all accounts tense—most notably with Germany— who Trump accused of being “captive to Russia” due to plans to build a new gas pipeline. The dark cloud of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election—as well as the recent indictment of Russian military intelligence officers by a federal grand jury—will keep the issue of election interference and Trump’s seeming unwillingness to press Putin on the issue in the spotlight. “Trump is going to Helsinki after having shown a lot of disdain for the Western alliance and lots of praise for Putin,” Angela Stent, a former U.S. national intelligence officer on Russia and a professor at Georgetown University, told me. “I’d think that’s making Putin quite pleased.” ### While the Finnish capital has been abuzz with around the clock preparations to knit together a smooth and efficient event on only a few weeks’ notice, the meeting in Helsinki has been producing anxiety across the West. On the one hand, expectations remain low. The word “summit,” used to denote a high-level meeting with a pre-arranged agenda, quickly vanished from official documents after it was announced in late June. Instead, Helsinki will be a flashy one-day event with an unstructured agenda that has largely come about due to Trump’s reported personal desire to meet with Putin, rather than the need to discuss a particular issue at the highest level. But the specter of a potential grand bargai n also hangs over the meeting. Trump has, for example, hinted about recognizing Moscow’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, sparking concerns that the U.S. president’s desire to “ get along ” with Russia could lead to concessions. ### All of this sets up the meeting in Helsinki as a historic, yet potentially hollow event, as the city plays host for the American and Russian leaders against a very different geopolitical backdrop than in the past. “This is not a meeting about substance, it is a meeting about being disruptive and trying to captivate the world,” Andrew Weiss, a former director for Russian, Ukrainian, and Eurasian Affairs on the National Security Council staff, told me. “Trump is trying to show his critics that even with the constraints on him, he still can force a new phase in U.S.-Russia relations,” Weiss said. ### This places Finland in an awkward spot. The country has shed its Cold War balancing act of appeasing Moscow while trying to integrate with Europe and today occupies an uneasy position as a Western country that shares an 833-mile border with Russia. Hosting the two presidents is both an opportunity for the government to showcase itself diplomatically and a source of national pride dating back Finland’s historical role as a mediator. ### But Putin and Trump’s coming arrival has also produced a good deal of unease. Not only are both men uniquely unpopular in the country—83 percent of Finns have a negative view of Trump and 76 percent have a negative view of Putin, according to recent poll—but the possibility of a rapprochement between them, and how it could affect the rest of the world, has unnerved some observers. “We don’t want these two leaders to cut deals over our heads,” Heidi Hautala, the vice president of the European Parliament, told journalists at a press conference in Helsinki on Friday. Hautala, a Finnish Member of European Parliament, is part of a large demonstration underway on Sunday in Helsinki organized by journalists, activists, and politicians to protest Putin and Trump’s domestic agendas and give a platform to global problems like climate change, inequality, and human-rights abuses that are unlikely to be discussed during the meeting with the two presidents. ### The diplomacy of human rights has a storied history in Helsinki. A 1975 summit with the United States, the Soviet Union, and 33 other countries helped codify their international protection, and Finland has since celebrated its role as a host country for talks and warmly welcomed leaders from Moscow and Washington. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev’s international reputation as a reformer led to a rockstar’s embrace in 1990. During the same visit, President George H.W. Bush shook hands and greeted Finns at an outdoor market before saying “Long live Finland!” from his limousine’s loudspeaker to the crowd. The city also played enthusiastic host to President Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin during their 1997 summit. ### Such a welcome is unlikely this time around. Trump’s attacks on the press, tough immigration policies, and sexist comments clash with the values of the majority of Finns. Similarly, Putin’s annexation of Crimea and sabre-rattling around the Baltic Sea have brought back memories of Finland’s difficult history with the Soviet Union that saw it fight two wars, cede territory, and have Moscow interfere in its domestic affairs. “We’re proud that Finland is able to bring these leaders here and push for dialogue,” Abdirahim “Husu” Hussein, a Finnish politician and activist involved in the protest, told me, “but both these guys are helping to diminish the status Europe and what it stands for. We need to make sure that human rights are not silenced during this meeting.” Organizers said they were expecting roughly 10,000 people to show up ahead of the protest (although only 2,400 said they are going on the demonstration’s Facebook page as of this writing). ### Putin’s political prisoners and other human-rights issues are unlikely to be on the agenda, however. Instead, Trump and Putin are said to be tackling a wider range of issues, but it remains to be seen if the meeting can produce any concrete results. “The practical outcomes for this are not clear at all,” Elena Chernenko, the foreign editor of the Russian newspaper Kommersant, told me. “But there is a desire to agree to something and take home a deliverable to move forward on.” The Kremlin would welcome any form of relief from sanctions due to its annexation of Crimea and role in the war in eastern Ukraine, but a 2017 law bars Trump from easing those sanctions without approval from the U.S. Congress. Arms control remains another potential area for discussion. Neither side has started talks on what to do when New START, a treaty between the two countries to cut their nuclear arsenals to 1,550 deployed warheads, expires in 2021. Putin and Trump could agree to trigger a provision and extend the treaty by five more years. But Trump rejected Putin’s offer to extend the agreement in a February 2017 phone call and John Bolton, Trump’s national-security adviser, remains an outspoken critic of the treaty. It’s possible Trump could ask for Russian assistance in Syria to limit Iran’s presence on the ground, but experts question Moscow’s ability to truly rein in Iran. ### In the end, Monday’s meeting will likely be designed to open the door to future discussions. The Kremlin is aware that Trump’s domestic problems make a rapprochement between Russia and the United States unlikely, but simply getting the meeting is itself a victory for Putin. Russia remains isolated from the West, but Trump’s deteriorating relations with European allies, and his apparent willingness to give Putin a pass on election interference, open the door for Moscow to end its isolation on its own terms. ### “Trump has created new divisions and given plenty of openings to exploit,” said Weiss. “As with much of what Trump does, it doesn’t require the Russians to do much except sit back and reap the knock on effects.” ### We want to hear what you think.

Add your two cents. ### Authored by Craig Murray, ### In my last post I set out the official Government account of the events in the Skripal Case. Here I examine the credibility of this story. Next week I shall look at alternative explanations. ### Russia has a decade long secret programme of producing and stockpiling novichok nerve agents. It also has been training agents in secret assassination techniques, and British intelligence has a copy of the Russian training manual, which includes instruction on painting nerve agent on doorknobs. ### The only backing for this statement by Boris Johnson is alleged “intelligence”, and unfortunately the “intelligence” about Russia’s secret novichok programme comes from exactly the same people who brought you the intelligence about Saddam Hussein’s WMD programme, proven liars. Furthermore, the question arises why Britain has been sitting on this intelligence for a decade and doing nothing about it, including not telling the OPCW inspectors who certified Russia’s chemical weapons stocks as dismantled. ### If Russia really has a professional novichok assassin training programme, why was the assassination so badly botched? Surely in a decade of development they would have discovered that the alleged method of gel on doorknob did not work? And where is the training manual which Boris Johnson claimed to possess? Having told the world – including Russia -the UK has it, what is stopping the UK from producing it, with marks that could identify the specific copy erased? ### The Russians chose to use this assassination programme to target Sergei Skripal, a double agent who had been released from jail in Russia some eight years previously. ### It seems remarkable that the chosen target of an attempt that would blow the existence of a secret weapon and end the cover of a decade long programme, should be nobody more prominent than a middle ranking double agent who the Russians let out of jail years ago. If they wanted him dead they could have killed him then. Furthermore the attack on him would undermine all future possible spy swaps. Putin therefore, on this reading, was willing to sacrifice both the secrecy of the novichok programme and the spy swap card just to attack Sergei Skripal. That seems highly improbable. ### Only the Russians can make novichok and only the Russians had a motive to attack the Skripals. ### The nub of the British government’s approach has been the shocking willingness of the corporate and state media to parrot repeatedly the lie that the nerve agent was Russian made, even after Porton Down said they could not tell where it was made and the OPCW confirmed that finding. In fact, while the Soviet Union did develop the “novichok” class of nerve agents, the programme involved scientists from all over the Soviet Union, especially Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia, as I myself learnt when I visited the newly decommissioned Nukus testing facility in Uzbekistan in 2002. ### Furthermore, it was the USA who decommissioned the facility and removed equipment back to the United States. At least two key scientists from the programme moved to the United States. Formulae for several novichok have been published for over a decade. The USA, UK and Iran have definitely synthesised a number of novichok formulae and almost certainly others have done so too. Dozens of states have the ability to produce novichok, as do many sophisticated non-state actors. ### As for motive, the Russian motive might be revenge, but whether that really outweighs the international opprobrium incurred just ahead of the World Cup, in which so much prestige has been invested, is unclear. ### What is certainly untrue is that only Russia has a motive. The obvious motive is to attempt to blame and discredit Russia. Those who might wish to do this include Ukraine and Georgia, with both of which Russia is in territorial dispute, and those states and jihadist groups with which Russia is in conflict in Syria. The NATO military industrial complex also obviously has a plain motive for fueling tension with Russia. ### There is of course the possibility that Skripal was attacked by a private gangster interest with which he was in conflict, or that the attack was linked to Skripal’s MI6 handler Pablo Miller’s work on the Orbis/Steele Russiagate dossier on Donald Trump. ### Plainly, the British governments statements that only Russia had the means and only Russia had the motive, are massive lies on both counts. ### The Russians had been tapping the phone of Yulia Skripal. They decided to attack Sergei Skripal while his daughter was visiting from Moscow. ### In an effort to shore up the government narrative, at the time of the Amesbury attack the security services put out through Pablo Miller’s long term friend, the BBC’s Mark Urban, that the Russians “may have been” tapping Yulia Skripal’s phone, and the claim that this was strong evidence that the Russians had indeed been behind the attack. ### But think this through. If that were true, then the Russians deliberately attacked at a time when Yulia was in the UK rather than when Sergei was alone. Yet no motive has been adduced for an attack on Yulia or why they would attack while Yulia was visiting – they could have painted his doorknob with less fear of discovery anytime he was alone. Furthermore, it is pretty natural that Russian intelligence would tap the phone of Yulia, and of Sergei if they could. The family of double agents are normal targets. I have no doubt in the least, from decades of experience as a British diplomat, that GCHQ have been tapping Yulia’s phone. Indeed, if tapping of phones is seriously put forward as evidence of intent to murder, the British government must be very murderous indeed. ### Their trained assassin(s) painted a novichok on the doorknob of the Skripal house in the suburbs of Salisbury. Either before or after the attack, they entered a public place in the centre of Salisbury and left a sealed container of the novichok there. ### The incompetence of the assassination beggars belief when compared to British claims of a long term production and training programme. The Russians built the heart of the International Space Station. They can kill an old bloke in Salisbury. Why did the Russians not know that the dose from the door handle was not fatal? Why would trained assassins leave crucial evidence lying around in a public place in Salisbury? Why would they be conducting any part of the operation with the novichok in a public area in central Salisbury? ### Why did nobody see them painting the doorknob? This must have involved wearing protective gear, which would look out of place in a Salisbury suburb. With Skripal being resettled by MI6, and a former intelligence officer himself, it beggars belief that MI6 did not fit, as standard, some basic security including a security camera on his house. ### The Skripals both touched the doorknob and both functioned perfectly normally for at least five hours, even able to eat and drink heartily. Then they were simultaneously and instantaneously struck down by the nerve agent, at a spot in the city centre coincidentally close to where the assassins left a sealed container of the novichok lying around. Even though the nerve agent was eight times more deadly than Sarin or VX, it did not kill the Skripals because it had been on the doorknob and affected by rain. ### Why did they both touch the outside doorknob in exiting and closing the door? Why did the novichok act so very slowly, with evidently no feeling of ill health for at least five hours, and then how did it strike both down absolutely simultaneously, so that neither can call for help, despite their being different sexes, weights, ages, metabolisms and receiving random completely uncontrolled doses. The odds of that happening are virtually nil. And why was the nerve agent ultimately ineffective? ### Detective Sergeant Bailey attended the Skripal house and was also poisoned by the doorknob, but more lightly. None of the other police who attended the house were affected. ### Why was the Detective Sergeant affected and nobody else who attended the house, or the scene where the Skripals were found? Why was Bailey only lightly affected by this extremely deadly substance, of which a tiny amount can kill? ### Four months later, Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess were rooting about in public parks, possibly looking for cigarette butts, and accidentally came into contact with the sealed container of a novichok. They were poisoned and Dawn Sturgess subsequently died. ### If the nerve agent had survived four months because it was in a sealed container, why has this sealed container now mysteriously disappeared again? If Rowley and Sturgess had direct contact straight from the container, why did they not both die quickly? Why had four months searching of Salisbury and a massive police, security service and military operation not found this container, if Rowley and Sturgess could? ### I am, with a few simple questions, demolishing what is the most ludicrous conspiracy theory I have ever heard – the Salisbury conspiracy theory being put forward by the British government and its corporate lackies. ### My next post will consider some more plausible explanations of this affair."

Undeterred, the American president is set to go face-to-face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompting a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a witch hunt. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV spectacle that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin’s primary mission was simply the occurrence of the summit. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington could find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one-on-one in the Finnish presidential palace’s opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor’s throne room. The leaders will then take questions at a press conference before going their separate ways. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow’s attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America’s closest allies, as a “foe.” ### “I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,” Trump said. ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump’s jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over “delinquent” defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### And on the eve of his meeting with Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump unleashed a series of attacks on the media as Air Force One descended into Helsinki, complaining that Democrats and the press were unlikely to give him credit for any summit accomplishments. ### “Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” Trump tweeted. “Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!” ### In his next tweet, he congratulated Putin on hosting “one of the best ever” World Cup tournaments. ### “Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,” said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, “not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime.” ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week — another chaotic stop on his European tour — that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'” said Trump, invoking a television detective. “There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question.” ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said “certainly I’ll be asking about it” although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn’t have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can’t force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia’s constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week’s indictment as part of a “shameful comedy” staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn’t contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria’s border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia’s carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level."

(Markus Schreiber/AP) ### President Donald Trump has no obvious goal and no agreed-upon agenda other than basking in the global spotlight when he meets in Helsinki on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### Share story ### Eli Stokols ### Los Angeles Times (TNS) ### HELSINKI — When President Donald Trump flew to Singapore last month to meet with Kim Jong Un, he had a clear agenda: try personal diplomacy, rather than insults and threats, in a still-unsuccessful effort to persuade North Korea to give up its arsenal of nuclear weapons. ### But Trump has no obvious goal and no agreed-upon agenda other than basking in the global spotlight when he meets in Helsinki on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, apparently planning to wing it — much as he did in Singapore — in hopes of charming the former KGB officer. ### Although Trump himself proposed the summit in March, only one White House aide, national-security adviser John Bolton, has met with senior Russians officials, a departure from typical planning. The two sides similarly have set no “deliverables,” tangible results that are normally determined long before a high-stakes summit. ### Summit suds ### A small Finnish craft brewery is paying a humorous tribute to the Helsinki summit. ### Rock Paper Scissors Brewing has issued a limited-edition lager depicting cartoon U.S. and Russian presidents on its label, with text for Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin saying “Let’s Settle This Like Adults” and “Making Lager Great Again.” ### The beer has been in high demand since it hit the shelves nationwide a few days ago and the whole 10,000-bottle run sold out. Samples have been delivered to the U.S. and Russian embassies in Helsinki. CEO Samuli Huuhtanen said Saturday that “a couple of good beers can help any negotiations,” especially if followed by a visit to a Finnish sauna. ### The Associated Press ### Trump has sought to lower expectations of any breakthrough on the critical policy and security divisions between the U.S. and Russia, including the Kremlin’s interference in the U.S. election in 2016, its illegal seizure of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine, its military role and support for Iranian forces in Syria, and the New START arms-control treaty set to expire in 2021. ### Most Read Nation & World Stories ### Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. ### “We go into that meeting not looking for so much,” Trump said Thursday after he had bashed Germany and roiled the NATO summit in Brussels, rifts that Putin is likely to applaud given his antipathy to the military alliance that is the continent’s main bulwark against Russian aggression. ### Trump exhibited remarkable nonchalance about what he called his “loose meeting” with the Russian strongman, whom he has never publicly criticized. “Hopefully, someday, maybe he’ll be a friend,” he said. ### Russia’s efforts to subvert the 2016 U.S. elections grew far more clear Friday when the Justice Department announced criminal charges against a dozen Russian intelligence officers for the systematic hacking of computers used by Hillary Clinton’s campaign, the Democratic National Committee, state boards of elections, and other entities. ### Trump said Friday in Britain that he would bring the issue up with Putin. But he did not condemn the Kremlin-backed operation or suggest he would demand a halt to what has now been laid out in two federal indictments and confirmed by U.S. intelligence agencies, and the House and Senate intelligence committees. ### “I will absolutely, firmly ask the question, and hopefully we’ll have a very good relationship with Russia,” he said. ### Many foreign-policy experts in Washington and in allied capitals fear that Trump may offer to ease sanctions, trim U.S. military operations in Europe, or make other concessions to Putin during a lengthy scheduled private meeting, without aides, early Monday. ### They point to Trump’s private meeting with the North Korean dictator on Sentosa Island on June 12. Afterward, Trump unexpectedly said he had agreed to halt joint U.S. military exercises with South Korea, a concession to Kim that blindsided the Pentagon and allies in Seoul and Tokyo. ### Indeed, asked if he would consider scrapping military exercises in the Baltic states if Putin asked him to, Trump replied, “Perhaps we’ll talk about that,” raising alarms in the front-line states. ### “I don’t even dare to speculate,” said one official from a NATO member state when asked about his expectations for Helsinki. “It’s so unpredictable right now in the current circumstances.” ### Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and Russia who served as a deputy secretary-general of NATO, said the summit “raises apprehensions” in Europe that Trump’s “going to become more friendly toward a brutal dictator than he is to his own allies.” ### Anything Trump says to undercut the NATO declaration that Russia’s annexation of Crimea was “illegal and illegitimate” would ease international pressure on Putin and be tantamount to “codifying aggression,” Vershbow said. ### Stephen Hadley, who served as President George W. Bush’s national-security adviser, said Trump’s willingness to engage with Putin shouldn’t be viewed as a blunder in and of itself. ### “Putin is a spoiler all around the world, trying to frustrate the U.S. everywhere,” Hadley said. “At some point, we’ll need to find a way to get a more constructive relationship with Russia. Trump could be able to do that.” ### Other analysts view Trump’s eagerness to meet Putin, with all the theatrics a summit will entail, as a diplomatic coup for Moscow since it remains under U.S. and international sanctions for its seizure of Crimea in 2014. ### The meeting “is Putin’s victory. He was waiting for this moment since 2014,” said Vladimir Frolov, an independent political analyst in Russia. “The positive atmospherics of the ‘historic and monumental summit’ will do.” ### Putin’s goal is “to clear the air, ratchet down the tensions and reset the relationship back to normal without yielding any ground on Ukraine and Crimea, Russian meddling and the intervention in Syria,” Frolov said. ### The Russians “aren’t going to expect much in the way of practical points to come out of the meeting,” said Mark Galeotti, a senior fellow at the Institute of International Relations in Prague and an expert on European security issues. “This will simply give them an opportunity to really encourage Trump to lob a grenade into Western unity, without the Kremlin really having to do much themselves.” ### The U.S. “remains the world’s only real superpower,” he added. “But the capacity of America to be able to leverage that for positive leadership is diminished pretty much every time Trump opens his mouth.” ### Trump’s outreach to Putin is all the more mystifying since it is at odds with his own administration’s far more wary stance on Russia. The U.S. ambassadors to Russia and NATO, for example, have expressed more traditionally hawkish views of Russia’s intentions and operations. ### Even those State Department and Pentagon officials who support his efforts to improve relations with Russia worry the president is being naive about the danger Putin poses to U.S. interests and allies. ### As on other fronts, Trump has made it clear he will rely largely on his instincts over advice from experts. His top Russia adviser, Fiona Hill, won’t even be in the meetings with Putin. ### “He made a calculation long ago that he doesn’t want a more antagonistic relationship with Russia,” said Jim Hanson, a Trump ally who is president of the Security Studies Group, a think tank in Washington. ### Hanson believes Trump could try to enlist Putin to keep Iran and its affiliated militant groups out of Syria, where they and Russian troops support President Bashar Assad’s government in the civil war. ### He speculated that Trump might agree to withdraw the 2,000 or so U.S. troops in Syria, something he and Putin would like. ### On July 6, the Kremlin denied Russian news reports that the withdrawal of Iran-backed militias would top the agenda at the summit. Bolton, Trump’s national-security adviser, said last week that the meeting could produce a “larger negotiation on helping to get Iranian forces out of Syria.” ### Russia appeared to shoot that down, however.

""But I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship. ... I really think the world wants to see us get along."" ### Putin, for his part, said he and Trump have maintained regular contact by phone and meeting at international events but ""the time has come to have a thorough discussion on various international problems and sensitive issues."" He added: ""There are quite a few of them for us to pay attention to."" ### Putin struck a casual pose during Trump's remarks, slouching in his chair with his legs wide and eyes low. He nodded along to some of Trump's remarks before they were translated, showcasing his fluency in English. ### Trump leaned forward in his chair, his hands tented in front of him and frequently glancing over at the Russian president. At one point, he shot Putin a wink. ### After Trump concluded his remarks, American reporters shouted several questions about whether he would bring up election meddling during his discussions with Putin. ### Trump did not respond; Putin appeared to smirk. ### With that, the two leaders gave a quick handshake and their private meeting in the opulent Gothic Hall was under way. Just the two of them, each with a translator. ### The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States — and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea — for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow's aggression may go unchallenged. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming ""many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" ### The summit, which was being closely monitored by rattled world capitals, was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump's presidential campaign. Undeterred, the American president was set to go face to face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian's leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British queen, among many others. ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn't ""expect anything"" from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. Not mentioned: Election meddling or Syria. ### Trump said last week that he would raise the election-meddling issue with Putin, but said he didn't expect Putin to budge on his denials. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### They'll continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."""

Undeterred, the American president was set to go face-to-face with Putin , the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### Trump , who has been trying to lower expectations about what the meeting will achieve, told reporters during a breakfast Monday morning with Finland’s president that he thought the summit would go “fine.” ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompting a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a witch hunt. ### In his tweets, Trump continued to undermine the investigation, and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia ’s efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump ’s favor. He claimed Obama “was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it.” ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin’s primary mission was simply to have the summit happen. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one-on-one in the Finnish presidential palace’s opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor’s throne room. The leaders will then take questions at a press conference before going their separate ways. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia ’s 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow ’s attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America’s closest allies, as a “foe.” ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump ’s jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over “delinquent” defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### “NATO is now strong & rich!” Trump wrote in a celebratory tweet Monday morning. During his breakfast, he said NATO had “never been more together” and said the summit had been “a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love.” ### Ahead of his sit-down with with Putin , who has cracked down on the free press, Trump has continued to unleash a series of attacks on the media, including as Air Force One descended into Helsinki. ### “Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” Trump tweeted. “Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!” ### “ Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,” said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia , Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin , she added, “not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime.” ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia . ### Trump said in Britain last week - another chaotic stop on his European tour - that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,’” said Trump , invoking a television detective. “There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question.” ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said “certainly I’ll be asking about it” although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn’t have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can’t force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia ’s constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week’s indictment as part of a “shameful comedy” staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia -U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn’t contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria’s border with Israel - a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia ’s carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level. ### ___"

2311,latimes.com,2018-07-15T06:14:21-04:00,"Helsinki is probably happy to be modestly hosting the Trump-Putin summit. (No boast) ### Jul 15, 2018 | 3:00 AM ### | Helsinki, FINLAND ### Helsinki Mayor Jan Vapaavuori stands on a balcony of City Hall overlooking the Finnish capital's market square and waterfront. (Sabra Ayres / Los Angeles Times) ### A few days before the summit between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the mayor of Helsinki stood in front of a large oil painting in a City Hall conference room and pondered the images. ### The artist’s delicate depiction of the Finnish capital’s central market square in 1877 captured Finland’s unique geopolitical position, Jan Vapaavuori said. ### Advertisement ### “On the left in the painting, you see the white Lutheran church, which represents our history with the West,” the mayor said. “To the east, you see the Russian Orthodox church, representing our history with the East. We are in the middle, with the two sides influencing us.” ### When Trump and Putin meet here on Monday for their first official sit-down summit, it will be the fourth time that Helsinki has hosted a meeting between leaders from Moscow and Washington, acting as a fulcrum between East and West. ### It comes, of course, at a time of especially fraught relations between the two nuclear powers. ### The first two summits were between the United States and the Soviet Union, which collapsed in 1991. The first was in 1975, when President Ford met with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev before and after a European-wide conference that resulted in the signing of the Helsinki Accords. The agreements were an attempt to improve relations between the communist East and the West. ### From left, President Ford, Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev and Soviet Prime Minister Andrei Gromyko in front of the Soviet Embassy in Helsinki in August 1975. (Vesa Klemetti / Associated Press) ### “At the conference in 1975, heads of states from 35 countries in Europe and North America suddenly appeared in Helsinki; it was a grand spectacle,” said Heikki Hakala, a Finnish journalist specializing in foreign and security policy. Hakala was 7 at the time and remembers waiting outside the Finnish parliament to wave at the VIP guests. “I was wearing a U.S.A. 1776 T-shirt with stars and stripes on it.” ### At one point in 1985, it appeared likely that President Reagan would meet Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Helsinki, but their first summit was ultimately held in Geneva. Gorbachev did meet a U.S. leader , President George H. W. Bush, in Helsinki in 1990, just a year before the breakup of the Soviet Union. Seven years later, President Clinton met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin to negotiate START III, a nuclear disarmament treaty, although it was never signed. ### From the archives: Yeltsin Leaves a Winner Despite NATO Impasse » ### Finland has a long and complicated history with Russia. The Nordic country became part of the Russian Empire after it was wrestled from Sweden in 1808. ### Helsinki might never have become the Finnish capital had it not been for the Russian Empire. The capital had been Turku, to the west, until Russian Czar Alexander I moved it to Helsinki in 1812, away from the Swedes and closer to St. Petersburg. ### Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917, the year of the Russian Revolution, but remained keenly aware of the military threat from the neighboring Soviet Union. The two countries fought a brief war in 1939 at the start of World War II when Moscow tried a land grab. Finland prevailed, but Helsinki realized that as a small country with a powerful neighbor, pursuing ties with the West meant maintaining a delicate dialogue with its giant eastern neighbor. ### “I think that with the careful balancing act there was a lot of dialogue,” said Hanna Smith, a specialist on Russia at the European Center of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, a nonprofit research group in Helsinki. “That is seen as beneficial to small countries.” ### Now Vapaavuori hopes that the Trump-Putin summit will be the start of the world seeing Finland as more than just a balancing act between East and West. ### “I’m more interested in the 2,000 journalists and other people coming for the summit than I am in Mr. Putin or Mr. Trump,” said Vapaavuori, who was elected in 2017. ### Finns describe themselves as practical, pragmatic and sensible. ### When the mayor’s office released a strategic plan this year to develop Helsinki into a leading international conference hub, it called the plan “Helsinki: The Most Functional City in the World.” A 60-page booklet promotes, among other things, the city’s rankings in safety (second in the world, 2017), public transportation (first in the world, 2017) and happiness ( first out of 156 countries surveyed, 2018). ### Advertisement ### Helsinki's south harbor, market square and the Swedish Embassy. (Mauritz Antin / EPA/Shutterstock) ### “We place very well in different rankings, but still, we are not that well known yet,” Vapaavuori said. “One of our challenges is that the capitals of Sweden and Denmark have more or less the same strengths that we have, but they are much better known.” ### Eager to take advantage of the influx of the global mass media coming for the summit, the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the mayor’s office joined forces to set up a media center at the Finlandia House in downtown Helsinki. ### They called it “Probably the Happiest Media Center in the World.” ### Finns are known also for being modest and humble; hence, the “probably.” ### In addition to assisting journalists covering the summit, the media center said in a news release that it will feature “quality services, Finnish food specialties, a shipping container converted into a sauna and a cozy Helsinki Lounge furnished with Finnish design, where you can watch the FIFA World Cup Final.” ### Not everyone is happy about the summit taking place in Helsinki. Helsinki for Human Rights, a coalition of nonpartisan groups in Finland, said thousands would march through the city center Sunday to “raise issues which the presidents of the United States and Russia usually do not address,” including threats to human rights and democracy, freedom of speech and the press, international security, and the environment. ### If some Helsinki residents aren’t as enthusiastic about hosting the Trump-Putin summit, it may be more about timing than politics. With the country’s long, cold winters and months of mostly dark days, practically all of Finland goes on holiday for most of July. Many head to lake cottages outside the city to take advantage of the warm weather and long days of sunlight. ### But fewer people means less traffic in the city center on the day of the event, the mayor said. ### ""I take a very pragmatic approach to what happens next: No one knows if the summit will end as a success or a failure,"" he said. ""But on the other hand, no one will praise the host city if it's a success, and no one will blame us if it's a failure. For a small city, which is really good but has an awareness problem in the rest of the world, we know this is of course a big opportunity for us."" ### Today's Headlines Newsletter"

With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### SIGN UP ### Be the first to know. ### No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. ### SIGN ME UP! ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ""I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,"" Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### ""The fact that we're having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,"" said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. ""What is important here is that we start a discussion."" ### Trump has been drawn to the spectacle of the summit and has expressed an eagerness to recreate in Helsinki the media show of last month's Singapore summit when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Even as many NATO leaders made supportive noises this week, the Helsinki summit has raised fears in many global capitals that Trump will pull back from traditional Western alliances, allowing Putin to expand his sphere of influence. ### Back home, too, there is wariness on Capitol Hill, with a number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans urging Trump to cancel the summit in the wake of the explosive indictments. ### But Trump has vowed that he can handle Putin, whom he has taken to referring to as a ""competitor"" rather than an adversary. ### And Trump in recent days has outlined some of the items he'd like to discuss, including Ukraine. Though the president has said he was ""not happy"" about Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, he puts the blame on his predecessor and says he will continue relations with Putin even if Moscow refuses to return the peninsula. ### Trump also said he and Putin would discuss the ongoing war in Syria and arms control, negotiations that White House officials have signaled could be fruitful. ### ""I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,"" the president said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. ""We've been modernizing and fixing and buying.  And it's just a devastating technology.  And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it's a very, very bad policy."" ### But it is the matter of election meddling, including fears Russia could try to interfere in the midterm elections this fall, that could play a central role in the summit talks or loom even larger if not addressed. In neither of Trump's previous meetings with Putin — informal talks on the sidelines of summits last year in Germany and Vietnam — did the president publicly upbraid the Russian leader, prompting questions about whether he believed the former KGB officer's denials over his own intelligence agencies' assessments of meddling. ### Trump repeatedly has cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking of his Democratic rivals and disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise it with Putin even as he downplayed its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think.  But you never know what happens, right?  But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### WHAT PUTIN WANTS ### For Putin, sitting down with Trump offers a long-awaited chance to begin repairing relations with Washington after years of spiraling tensions. ### Putin wants the U.S. and its allies to lift sanctions, pull back NATO forces deployed near Russia's borders and restore business as usual with Moscow. In the longer run, he hopes to persuade the U.S. to acknowledge Moscow's influence over its former Soviet neighbors and, more broadly, recognize Russia as a global player whose interests must be taken into account. ### These are long-term goals, and Putin realizes that no significant progress will come from just one meeting. More than anything else, he sees Monday's summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### ""Russia-U.S. ties aren't just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. ""It's unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don't meet."" ### Moscow views Trump's criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump's election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament's upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won't engage in vague talk about ""illusory subjects,"" such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia's return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he's likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be ""pointless"" to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea's status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine's push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### ""Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,"" Lukyanov said. ""But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident."""

Evan Vucci, File AP Photo ### Nuclear arms race is an expected topic for Trump-Putin talks ### By ROBERT BURNS AP National Security Writer ### July 14, 2018 04:22 PM ### WASHINGTON ### President Donald Trump seems of two minds on nuclear weapons. He muses about eliminating them but also has called for a U.S. buildup and bragged about his nuclear ""button."" ### In March, while forecasting a face-to-face meeting on this topic with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said in the same breath that an arms race was ""getting out of control"" and that he would never allow any country to have weapons ""even close to what we have,"" although Russia already does. ### How these seemingly competing instincts will play out in his talks Monday with Putin in Helsinki could profoundly affect the direction of U.S. defense policy. ### Before leaving a NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday, Trump was asked by a reporter whether he would raise long-standing U.S. allegations that Russia is violating a Cold War-era nuclear arms treaty, and whether he favors extending a separate treaty that he has criticized in the past as disadvantaging the U.S. ### SIGN UP ### Be the first to know. ### No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. ### SIGN ME UP! ### His one-word answer to the two-part question was ""yes"" — the first public indication that he wants to extend the New Start treaty, which expires in three years. Then on Friday, he vaguely spoke about how ""it would be a tremendous achievement if we could do something about nuclear proliferation."" ### Yet Trump's administration has shown little interest in negotiating further reductions in American and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. It has been more focused on formulating its own nuclear policy and on combating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. ### U.S.-Russian strategic nuclear weapons — those capable of striking each other's territory — are governed by New Start, which was negotiated by the Obama administration in 2010. It limits each country to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads. President Barack Obama favored further cuts, but U.S.-Russian relations soured after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea. ### The New Start deal is set to expire in February 2021 unless both sides agree to extend it. The Trump administration has been reviewing its position, so it's unclear whether Trump and Putin will do more than agree that their staffs should study the possibility of an extension. Private U.S. arms control advocates are urging an extension, in part because they see value in a treaty provision allowing each side to monitor what the other is doing on strategic weapons. ### Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, says Trump and Putin could instruct their aides to begin formal work on a five-year extension of the treaty, which would not require a renegotiation of its terms or ratification by the legislative branch of either government. ### ""If they don't extend New Start, there is a worrisome possibility that by 2021 there will be no legally binding limits on the world's two largest arsenals, and as a result, all of the difficult security challenges we have with the Russians will become even more difficult to manage,"" Kimball said. ### Analysts have puzzled over Trump's likely approach to an arms control discussion with Putin. The Russian leader said in May that his military would soon begin fielding a new generation of nuclear weapons, including a globe-circling ballistic missile that he previously said could fly over either the North or the South Pole to strike targets anywhere in the world with more powerful and more numerous warheads. Putin claimed it could evade any missile defense system. ### Putin also has promoted Russia's development of a nuclear-armed hypersonic vehicle that he said is more advanced than anything in the U.S. arsenal. Hypersonic flight equates to going Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. The U.S. is working on hypersonic missile technology but has said it fears falling behind Russia and China. ### Trump and Putin seem unlikely to get into this sort of detail, given that arms control would be just one of several topics raised, including the Syrian civil war. ### Even Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, seemed uncertain how Trump would address arms control issues in Helsinki, but he predicted they would discuss U.S. accusations that Russia is violating the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. ### That was the first superpower agreement to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched and cruise missiles with ranges of between 500 kilometers and 5,500 kilometers, or about 310 miles and 3,400 miles. Washington says Moscow is violating the treaty by testing and deploying a prohibited cruise missile. Russia strongly denies any violation and has in turn charged that some elements of Washington's missile defense system violate the treaty. ### Stephan Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, sees room for a Trump-Putin agreement on resolving these violation charges. ### ""You could have verification visits by the two sides to address that,"" he said, suggesting physical inspections of perhaps the Russian missile's fuel tank. That could help resolve the question of how far the missile can fly, while also protecting against disclosure of sensitive missile technology information. ### The list of U.S. complaints about Russian behavior in the nuclear realm has grown longer in recent years. This tension is captured in the Trump administration's updated nuclear policy, which points to Russian reliance on nuclear weapons as justification for deploying new types of U.S. nuclear weapons. ### It warned that Russian strategy on the potential coercive and military uses of nuclear weapons, ""increase the prospect for dangerous miscalculation and escalation."""

The arguments feed the Kremlin narrative that democracy is dangerous unless it is carefully “managed.” ### Russian commentators and editorialists who consider the European Union hostile, troublesome or irrelevant welcomed Trump’s criticism of longtime European allies as “foes” to the U.S. ### Russia’s state-run Channel One said Trump’s meetings in Britain and contentious appearance at the NATO summit last week were secondary to Monday’s summit, saying: “After all, he was just passing through Brussels and London on the way to Helsinki.” ### Konstantin Kosachev, head of the upper house of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, wrote in Izvestia that Monday’s talks come at a time when “so-called ‘peace-loving’ Europe is afraid of peace talks between U.S. and Russia.” ### Russian media did have rather tempered expectations of how much Putin can concretely get from the summit, but hoped for progress on solutions for Syria and Mideast tensions. ### Heading into the summit, Trump denounced the American news media as the “enemy of the people,” despite constitutional protections for freedom of the press. ### The Russian media scene is a different beast. Under Putin, the government has assumed control or sway over most broadcasters and mainstream media and put pressure on critical reporting online. Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some outspoken Russian journalists. ### A protest sign for the summit posted on a Helsinki bus stop Monday read “Unpleasant things will happen to Journalists who ask Putin questions.” ### Despite clear interest in Russia in Putin’s meeting with Trump, the summit wasn’t the No. 1 item on many Russian newscasts or websites Monday: That honor went to the World Cup, and Russia’s own global image. ### ANGELA CHARLTON"

I don't think you'll have any, 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.' There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think, but you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely, firmly ask the question,"" Trump said. ""And hopefully, we'll have a very good relationship with Russia."" ### Instead, the U.S. president is setting his sights on establishing a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) between the United States and Russia to continue decades of progressive nuclear disarmament between the two countries, the source told CNN. The source said Trump has been fired up about making progress on extending the U.S. and Russia's denuclearization treaty, now known as New Start which is set to expire in 2021. ### Trump sees progress on an arms control treaty as the likeliest area of progress for the Trump-Putin summit, the source said. ### ""The proliferation is a tremendous -- I mean, to me, it's the biggest problem in the world, nuclear weapons. Biggest problem in the world,"" Trump said on Friday. ""So, we could do something to substantially reduce them -- I mean, ideally get rid of them. It's -- maybe that's a dream."" ### The White House declined a CNN request for comment. ### But as Trump and Putin prepare to arrive in Helsinki, the source with knowledge of the discussions said there is still no set, organized agenda for the summit. Privately, Trump has also made clear that he is unsure how the summit will unfold and what the outcome will be, the source said. ### The risks of the meeting, the source said, are if Trump offers something for free -- such as reducing U.S. support for Ukraine or offers ambiguity on Crimea. Or if Trump's bonding with Putin emboldens Europeans who want to lift sanctions on Russia -- the new Italian government, Hungary or Austria. ### Trump and U.S. officials have made clear they intend to raise a series of issues during the Helsinki summit, from the ongoing civil war in Syria to Russian actions in Ukraine to cyberactivities and North Korea. ### Trump believes his discussions with Putin on Syria could yield the crude beginnings of a deal, but any agreement would be very preliminary. Trump, who is eager to withdraw U.S. troops from the country, would like for Russia to get the Iranians to pull out of Syria, according to the source, but many experts within and outside the administration see that as an unrealistic demand the Russians will not be able to deliver on. ### On North Korea, Ukraine and cyber issues, the potential outcomes of Trump and Putin's talks seem less clear. ### The source with knowledge of Trump's discussions said Putin is still eager to form a joint Russia-U.S. cybersecurity unit, which remains unlikely. The source said it is possible Trump and Putin agree to a working-level dialogue on cybersecurity issues. ### On North Korea, the source said Russian officials do not believe Trump's maximum pressure campaign has worked, but agree on the objective of nonproliferation and want to be involved in the denuclearization talks. ### The United States, though, would rather continue its bilateral talks with North Korea. However, this source believes it's likely Putin will offer technical assistance, such as expertise in the removal of nuclear material and that Trump may well agree to Russian involvement in some way, which would also be something of a win for Putin. ### Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

2430,newsbusters.org,2018-07-15T16:07:01-04:00,"‘Cannot Be Trusted’: CNN Promotes Conspiracies After Slamming Liar Trump ### Reddit ### By Nicholas Fondacaro | July 15, 2018 3:21 PM EDT ### President Trump was set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, and the liberal media were in full campaign mode as they pushed speculation the President was a Russian agent meeting with his handler. ### CNN’s Brian Stelter admitted as much during Sunday’s Reliable Sources, saying, “Trump opponents will speculate that he's really a Russian agent, having a meeting with his handler, betraying America.” While he did say that, Stelter also declared that no one could trust the President’s account of the meeting and gave those conspiracy theories room to grow. ### Stelter kicked off the program by casting doubt over whether or not the President was trustworthy enough for us to believe his account of the one-on-one meeting Putin. “No aides, no note-takers. So, we'll never really know what is said because, really, can we trust either man? No. We can't,” he bitterly spat. ### The CNN host bemoaned about how long-gone were the days of presidents who spoke only in truth and commanded power. “But not now. Not anymore,” he decried: ### What President Trump says is so frequently false or nonsensical that his words don't have the same meaning, the same power, the same impact as past presidents. It's a shame but it's true. Trump simply cannot be trusted. He has proven this himself time and time again. It's his own lies and his own contradictions that have proven it. ### Interestingly enough, if you swapped out the references to Trump and replaced them with references to the media, it still worked. ###  ###  ### While Stelter proceeded to rail against the President and “Trump partisans who will proclaim him to be a strong leader, improving the U.S./Russia relationship” in the vacuum of trusted accounts, he leaned on those liberal conspiracy theorists to drive his message home. ### First up was, CNN national security analyst Samantha Vinograd who asserted that Trump and Putin had a lot in common since they were both “propaganda machines”. “And Donald Trump has proven himself to be a tool, a Russian tool for spreading that misinformation and disinformation,” she declared. Stelter failed to mention she was a former Obama official, which meant her analysis was biased. ### Appearing not at all bothered by the assertion and not one to miss a chance to attack Fox News, Stelter tried to slime Chris Wallace for being the one who managed to snag a Putin interview for the powerhouse network. “Exactly. He knows that Fox is the president's preferred outlet. And he knows how to play his asset. And Donald Trump, either wittingly or unwittingly, is an asset of the Russian government,” Vinograd agreed. ### Stelter seized onto her accusation of Trump being a Russian spy asset and turned to fringe conspiracy theorist and New York magazine writer, Jonathan Chait to share his wild accusation that Trump had been helping Russia in the U.S. since the late 1980’s. ### “Well, what I was trying to do in this story is to make the case that we've been behind the facts on the Russia story since the beginning,” he argued. “We keep catching up, we keep assuming the truth is just one or two steps ahead of us. And there's so much incriminating information. Much of it has been forgotten.” Chait appeared to hang his accusation on the claims of anti-Trump, former CIA-Director John Brennan. And he begged for people to believe him. ### Clearly into the craziness, Stelter was fearful that “these conversations end up sounding like they’re conspiracy theories in the same way that, you know, I say Sean Hannity is engaging in that kind of behavior”. ### Reliable Sources had become a place where media-televangelist Brian Stelter could sing the praises of the cult. It’s a place where hypocrisy could flourish. It’s a place where he could denounce the President for the lies he told while telling his own. Contrary to the network’s slogan, facts were not first there. ### This is CNN. ### The transcript is below, click ""expand"" to read: ###  ### 11:00:45 AM Eastern [1 minute 38 seconds] ### (…) ### BRIAN STELTER: But first, one of the world's big mysteries. How will we know what really happens when Trump and Putin get together? Right now, hundreds of journalists are descending on Helsinki. 1,500 reporters from 61 countries have applied for credentials to cover the U.S./Russia meeting. But they're going to have very little access to the key events. Putin and Trump plan to meet for a private conversation one-on-one conversation before official talks begin. No aides, no note-takers. So, we'll never really know what is said because, really, can we trust either man? No. We can't. ### In the past, the U.S. President's words have projected power and shaped global decisions. What the president said meant something. It meant a lot. But not now. Not anymore. What President Trump says is so frequently false or nonsensical that his words don't have the same meaning, the same power, the same impact as past presidents. It's a shame but it's true. Trump simply cannot be trusted. He has proven this himself time and time again. It's his own lies and his own contradictions that have proven it. And that is why this is a profound test for journalists. How do you cover a person who twists truth like it's a game? Just saying, oh, well the president said, that is not sufficient anymore, if it ever was. ### (…) ### 11:03:38 AM Eastern [33 seconds] ### STELTER: Typically, usually, the truth comes out. But it might not this time. Not when Trump and Putin meet privately. Of course, nature and the media both abhor a vacuum. So the unknowns are going to be filled up by Trump partisans who will proclaim him to be a strong leader, improving the U.S./Russia relationship. At the same time, Trump opponents will speculate that he's really a Russian agent, having a meeting with his handler, betraying America. The divide is that stark. ### (…) ### 11:05:53 AM Eastern [4 minutes 39 seconds] ### STELTER: With regards to all the reporting that has been done, about Trump’s views of Putin and views of Russia, Samantha Vinograd, what do we know for sure about he's walking into? What do we know for sure about Trump’s attitude? ### SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, we definitely know that Trump and Vladimir Putin have a few things in common when it comes to the media. Both of them happen to be propaganda machines. They spread misinformation, disinformation, and sow divisions in the United States. That’s Russia’s mission we know from the intelligence community. And Donald Trump has proven himself to be a tool, a Russian tool for spreading that misinformation and disinformation. ### (…) ### STELTER: I wonder what it means, if anything, that Putin has selected Fox's Chris Wallace to sit down with, to have an exclusive conversation after the meeting. It seems like Putin knows to go to Fox. But at the same time, Wallace is a really tough interviewer. ### VINOGRAD: Exactly. He knows that Fox is the president's preferred outlet. And he knows how to play his asset. And Donald Trump, either wittingly or unwittingly, is an asset of the Russian government. If you're Vladimir Putin, you're going into this meeting and you’re thinking, “Okay, I have my playbook, I'm going to flatter President Trump, he likes compliments. I'm going to talk to him about conspiracies within the United States. And I'm going to talk about things that he likes and things that he trusts, like Fox News."" ### Imagine if Putin had said, “No, I'm going to go give an interview to CNN or MSNBC.” President Trump's spine would have been up, he would have been worried that Putin was going to say something that he didn't like. This way, President Trump is incredibly comfortable going into this meeting. To use president trump's words from a few days ago, he's easy. President Trump is an easy target. ### STELTER: You talked about him being an unwitting Russian asset. Jonathan Chait, you went a step further in your cover story for New York magazine this week. If we could put in on screen, I think. You talked about whether President Trump has actually been a Russian asset for decades! Now, you acknowledge this is unlikely, but you're making the point that it's possible. ### JONATHAN CHAIT: Yeah. ### STELTER: Talk us through it. ### CHAIT: Well, what I was trying to do in this story is to make the case that we've been behind the facts on the Russia story since the beginning. When the hack was first reported, nobody thought that Russia was actually trying to help Donald Trump. We keep catching up, we keep assuming the truth is just one or two steps ahead of us. And there's so much incriminating information. Much of it has been forgotten. ### One of the things I begin with is the fact that the former CIA director, John Brennan, received intercepts from European intelligence agencies of Russian officials talking about their connections to the Trump campaign. And then Brennan came out and said that he thinks Putin has something secret, some blackmail leverage over the President of the United States. That's an astonishing charge. And it's made by someone who actually has some information at his disposal and I think we should actually take it seriously. ### STELTER: Is there a risk, Jonathan, these conversations end up sounding like they’re conspiracy theories in the same way that, you know, I say Sean Hannity is engaging in that kind of behavior? ### CHAIT: There certainly is a risk. I mean, I think you have to be cautious about what the facts show. You can't get ahead of the facts, you can't say this definitely happened when you think possibly it just happened. You have to look at other possibilities, as I do. In every step, I try to show where there could be innocent explanations. Sometimes when someone does something that doesn't make sense, sometimes people do things that don't make sense, and you have to be open to that. ### But look, when you have serious information and you’ve got serious figures making these charges, I think you actually have to, not just blind yourself to the outcomes that they're putting right in front of your face, but say, this is one of the things that might actually be where the story is going. ### (…)"

What, do you think our country’s so innocent? Take a look at what we’ve done, too. We’ve made a lot of mistakes. . . . So, a lot of killers around, believe me.” ### There was strong and vocal pushback at the time from most elected Republicans. ### -- Over the past several days, as Trump again engaged in a spree of whataboutism and moral relativism ahead of today’s summit in Helsinki with Putin, far fewer GOP lawmakers have called him out. ### Piers Morgan, the former CNN host and a one-time contestant on “Celebrity Apprentice,” interviewed Trump aboard Air Force One for the Daily Mail as he visited the United Kingdom. As the president discussed his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Morgan interrupted: “He’s a ruthless dictator.” ### “Sure he is,” Trump said. “He’s ruthless, but so are others. I mean, I could name plenty of others that we deal with that you don’t say the same thing about. I mean plenty of the people that I deal with are pretty ruthless people.” ### Asked if Putin would be in that group, Trump replied: “I can’t tell you that. I assume he probably is. But I could name others also. Look, if we can get along with Russia, that’s a good thing.” ### Then, in an interview that aired Sunday , CBS’s Jeff Glor asked Trump at his golf course in Scotland to identify the “biggest foe globally right now.” Trump named the European Union, which includes many of America’s closest historic allies. “Well, I think we have a lot of foes,” the president said. “I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now you wouldn't think of the European Union, but they're a foe. Russia is foe in certain respects. China is a foe economically … But that doesn't mean they are bad. It doesn't mean anything. It means that they are competitive.” ### Trump also continued his pattern of blaming the American victim, not the foreign attacker. The president attacked the Democratic National Committee for allowing itself to get hacked and Barack Obama for not more forcefully responding, rather than the Russian government for conducting the hacks. “We had much better defenses. I’ve been told that by a number of people. We had much better defenses, so they couldn’t,” Trump said on CBS, referring to his campaign and the Republican National Committee. “I think the DNC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing themselves to be hacked. They had bad defenses and they were able to be hacked.” ### Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer, visits a shooting range at the Russian Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate in Moscow in 2006. (Dmitry Astakhov/Sputnik/Kremlin Pool/AP) ### -- Trump hasn’t changed, but the Republican Party has. CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Sunday how Trump should hold Putin accountable after a dozen Russian officials were indicted last week for orchestrating a massive hacking campaign to interfere with American democracy. Paul replied that it is unrealistic to hold Moscow accountable. ### “They are going to interfere in our elections. We also do the same,” said Paul, citing a study that he said shows the United States interfered in the elections of other countries 81 times during a 50-year period in the last century. “So, we all do it. What we need to do is make sure our electoral process is protected.” ### Paul, who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, has always been a libertarian, but he often tried to downplay this side of his worldview when he sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Now that Trump is in control, he’s talking much more like his father again. ### -- Even traditional hawks are now minimizing what the Russians did in 2016. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who chairs the Europe subcommittee on Foreign Relations, said after returning from a July Fourth visit to Moscow that Congress overreacted to Russia’s interference in our elections. “I've been pretty upfront that the election interference — as serious as that was and unacceptable — is not the greatest threat to our democracy,” he told the conservative Washington Examiner . “We've blown it way out of proportion — [as if it's] the greatest threat to democracy . . . We need to really honestly assess what actually happened, what effect did it have, and what effect are our sanctions actually having, positively and negatively.” ### Would he feel the same way if Russia interfered in his 2016 reelection campaign to help Russ Feingold, his Democratic opponent? ### “Johnson’s remarks to the Examiner were highlighted by Russian state media,” Roll Call reported . “The Russian news agency TASS reported on Johnson’s comments, as did Sputnik International.” ### Pressed on his comments last week during an appearance on WOSH, an AM talk radio station in Oshkosh, Johnson doubled down on his position that the U.S. faces more serious threats than election hacking. “It’s very difficult to really meddle in our elections,” the senator said. “It just is. These are locally run. It’s almost impossible to change the vote tally. My concern would be violating the voter files, but we have those issues anyway and there are plenty of controls on that. … From a standpoint of using social media, we spent a couple of billion dollars on the last election. They, maybe, spent a couple hundred thousand.” ### -- “Most countries would meddle and play in our domestic elections if they could, and some of them have,” Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said recently. “We have to be realistic [that] nations are going to do what is in their [national] interest. We’ve done a lot of things, too.” ### Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, made that comment to the Examiner as he prepared to lead a delegation of Senate Republicans on a CODEL to Russia. The group was in Moscow when the Senate Intelligence Committee published a bipartisan report that validated the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in 2016 election on the personal orders of Putin. ### “I’m not here today to accuse Russia of this or that or so forth,” Shelby told the speaker of the Duma in Moscow during the controversial trip . ### Shelby later sought to clarify that he was not saying Russia and the U.S. are the same, and that he is not excusing everything Moscow has done. “I was just stating the reality of it,” he told the Daily Beast . ### -- It’s hard to be surprised anymore, but it is nonetheless surreal to read quotes from Republican senators that sound like they might have been uttered instead by Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn or Chalmers Johnson. Conservatives like Jeane Kirkpatrick hammered peacenik liberals for this sort of relativism during the Cold War . Republicans used to be the ones who not only espoused American exceptionalism but accused Democrats of acting like the United States was just another name on the United Nations roster, somewhere between Albania and Zimbabwe. ### As Ronald Reagan told the National Association of Evangelicals in 1983, “I urge you to beware the temptation of … blithely declaring yourselves above it all and to label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire.” ### -- Trump, who took out full-page newspaper ads to attack Reagan’s foreign policy during the 1980s (even as it was winning the Cold War), has remade the Republican Party in his image over the past three years. The president has shown a consistent impulse to blame “both sides.” After the violence in Charlottesville last August, Trump said there are “two sides to a story.” He attacked counterprotesters for acting “very, very violently” as they came “with clubs in their hand” at the neo-Nazis and KKK members who were protesting the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue. “You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent, and nobody wants to say that,” Trump said. “Do they have any semblance of guilt? Do they have any problem? I think they do!” ### -- To be sure, there are notable holdouts. Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), battling brain cancer, put out a rare statement calling on Trump to cancel today’s meeting — if he is “not prepared to hold Putin accountable.” ### “Putin is a murderer,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) tweeted Sunday night. “He has ordered the assassinations of political adversaries and used outlawed chemical weapons to do it. He oversees Russian military units that shot down Malaysian flight 17 and murdered almost 300 civilians. … Putin is a crook and a liar. He has broken almost every agreement he has signed with the United States, including on Syria and Ukraine. He has become one of the world's richest men through embezzlement and stealing from his own people.” ### -- Paul’s comments on the Sunday shows were deeply revealing. The senator was adamant that he was not engaging in moral equivalency, but he suggested multiple times that the Kremlin was reacting to U.S. policy. Among the supposed provocations: Hillary Clinton calling for free and fair elections in Russia when she was secretary of state. “One of the reasons they really didn't like Hillary Clinton,” he told Tapper on CNN, “is they found her responsible for some of the activity by the U.S. in their elections under the Obama administration.” ### Explaining his decision to vote against a resolution expressing support for NATO last week, Paul reached back even further: “The provocation of pushing NATO forward after … James Baker promised [Mikhail] Gorbachev in 1990 when Germany unified that we would not go, the West would not go, one inch beyond Germany, and yet, a couple years later, under the Clinton administration, we kept pushing, pushing, pushing. … From Russia's perspective, they see NATO expansion as a threat. … Part of their militarism and part of their nationalism problem may be inherent to the tides of the current century there, but it's also in reaction to policy from the West as well.” ### -- This view is squarely outside the mainstream among foreign policy experts in both parties. Col. James McDonough, the U.S. Army’s attache to Poland, highlighted “Russia’s Moral Hypocrisy” in a piece for Task and Purpose magazine this spring: “Russian soldiers occupy Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine in violation of all international norms. Through these occupations Moscow enables the pirate state of Transnistria, enables the backwards ‘independence’ of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, strips Crimea from its internationally recognized sovereign, and feeds the Russian separatist movement in the Donbass.  After supporting Libyan leader Mommar Khadafi for years, the Kremlin now backs one of his henchmen, warlord Khalifa Hafter, instead of the Western-backed, and UN-recognized, Government of National Accord, reportedly in exchange for military basing rights in eastern Libya. Further east in Sudan, Russia is exporting arms to the government of Omar al-Bashir whose abysmal record on human rights has left him shunned by more civilized countries. Most alarmingly, Russia has cozied up to Iran, the most significant exporter of terrorism in the Middle East, and Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, whose atrocities against his own people are now well known to the world. Russia’s bedfellows reek, and yet Moscow does not mind the smell. And where on the globe has Russian foreign policy been a force for justice and decency? Nothing comes to mind.” ### If you want to go deeper, here are two recent pieces that capture what was until recently a bipartisan consensus: ### “Russia and America Aren't Morally Equivalent. There is no comparison between Russian efforts to undermine elections and American efforts to strengthen them,” by Princeton professor Thomas Melia in the Atlantic . ### “Russia’s nefarious meddling is nothing like democracy assistance,” by Daniel Twining, president of the International Republican Institute, and Kenneth Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute,  in The Washington Post . ### -- Paul announced during a separate appearance Sunday on Fox News that he’s planning a trip to Russia next month with members of the libertarian Cato Institute. “We’ll be talking to the president after Helsinki and asking him if there’s something we can follow up on,” the Kentucky senator told Ed Henry. “I think there are a lot of simplistic people out there on both sides of the aisle that are criticizing President Trump. Engagement is a good idea. Even during the height of the Cuban missile crisis, there was a direct line of communication between [John] Kennedy and [Nikita] Khrushchev. … We don’t want to mistakenly amble into a war because we were in close proximity and didn’t know it.” ### -- In March, the Russian Embassy in Washington tweeted a picture of Paul meeting with Ambassador Anatoly Antonov. It said that the two men had discussed “improving” and “restoring” relations. A few minutes later, the embassy deleted that tweet. The picture was later reposted with a more anodyne caption that used neither of those words, according to Business Insider . ### -- Asked on CBS if he’ll demand Putin to extradite the dozen Russians who have been indicted by the Justice Department, Trump said: “I hadn’t thought of that.” ### “Well, I might,” he added. “But, again, this was during the Obama administration. They were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration.” ### “It’s pretty silly for the president to demand something that he can’t get legally,” national security adviser John Bolton said on ABC. “The Russians take the position — you can like it or not like it — that their constitution forbids them to extradite Russian citizens.” ### U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman added on NBC that the FBI will “no doubt” work with the embassy to submit the request, but he noted that this “doesn’t necessarily mean that the Russians are going to follow through.” ### Paul said on CNN that making such a request would “be a moot point”: “I don't think Russia is sending anyone back over here for trial, the same way we wouldn't send anybody over there for trial.  No country with any sovereignty or sense of sovereignty is sending anybody to another country for trial.” ### BLINKING RED LIGHTS: ### -- It was overshadowed by the indictments, but the nation’s top intelligence official gave a very significant speech on Friday afternoon at the Hudson Institute think tank in D.C. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana, likened the cyber threat today to the climate before Sept. 11, 2001, when intelligence channels were “blinking red” with warning signs that a terrorist attack was imminent. ### “Here we are nearly two decades later, and I’m here to say the warning lights are blinking red again,” Coats said, according to the Associated Press . “The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, in coordination with international partners, have detected Russian government actors targeting government and businesses in the energy, nuclear, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors. … We are seeing aggressive attempts to manipulate social media and to spread propaganda focused on hot-button issues that are intended to exacerbate socio-political divisions.” ### Coats added that intelligence analysts are not seeing the identical sort of electoral interference as two years ago. “However, we fully realize that we are just one click on a keyboard away from a similar situation repeating itself,” he said. “These actions are persistent. They’re pervasive and they are meant to undermine America’s democracy on a daily basis, regardless of whether it is election time or not.” ### -- Here are three other sobering stories that should be on your radar: ### 1. The same Russian military intelligence service accused of disrupting our 2016 election is also believed to be responsible for the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, England, earlier this year.  Ellen Barry, Michael Schwirtz and Eric Schmitt report in today’s New York Times: “British investigators believe the March 4 attack … was most probably carried out by current or former agents of the service, known as the G.R.U., who were sent to his home in southern England … British officials are now closing in on identifying the individuals they believe carried out the operation[.] [The Justice Department’s Friday indictment] detailed a sophisticated operation … carried out by a Russian military intelligence service few Americans know about. But analysts and government officials say the G.R.U. [serves] as an undercover strike force for the Kremlin in conflicts around the world. The agency has been linked to Russia’s hybrid war in Ukraine, as well as the annexation of Crimea in 2014. It has been involved in the seizing of Syrian cities on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad. In more peaceful regions, the G.R.U. is accused of creating political turmoil, mobilizing Slavic nationalists in Montenegro and funding protests to try to prevent Macedonia’s recent name change.” ### 2. “Russia Hawk Axed From National Security Council Right Before Trump-Putin Summit,” by the Daily Beast’s Kate Brannen and Spencer Ackerman : “The circumstances of retired Army Colonel Richard Hooker’s departure from the National Security Council on June 29 are in dispute. It’s not clear whether Hooker was forced out or if his detail on the NSC came to its natural end. But what’s not in doubt is that for the past 15 months, Hooker was senior director for Russia, Europe and NATO. … Hooker ended his tour on the National Security Council early after he discussed information pertinent to Russia with foreign officials without proper authorization, according to two government officials. … A former NSC official strongly denied [that] account.” ### 3. “A senior FBI official overseeing a government task force that addresses Russian attempts to meddle in U.S. elections has left the government for a job in the private sector,” the Wall Street Journal’s Dustin Volz reported Saturday . “Jeffrey Tricoli had been coleading the FBI foreign influence task force until June, when he left government work for a senior vice president job at Charles Schwab Corp. … Mr. Tricoli, an 18-year veteran of the FBI who became a section chief of the bureau’s cyber division in December 2016, didn’t respond to requests for comment sent to his personal email and LinkedIn account. ### “The reason for Mr. Tricoli’s departure wasn’t clear. But it adds to questions among some tech companies and lawmakers about how much the administration, and the task force in particular, are doing to protect future elections from Russian meddling. ### “Clint Watts, a former FBI agent and author of a book about information wars on social media, said the Trump administration has shown little interest in addressing Russian meddling, leaving the FBI’s efforts to tackle foreign influence ‘reactive’ instead of anticipatory.” ### -- Hard feelings watch: Jeb Bush named “ The Manchurian Candidate ” as the greatest political novel of all time. “It is a good read and shows that the Russians have always tried to get involved in our elections,” the former Florida governor told Steve Israel for a feature that ran this weekend . ### And Hillary Clinton posed this question on Twitter last night: ### Great World Cup.

It had already attracted attention as conservative figures came forward to say the comedian had tricked them into appearing in the new show. Hank Stuever reviews the first episode : “Cohen concluded the show disguised as Col. Erran Morad, an Israeli commando who comes to Washington to promote ‘Kinderguardians,’ a new program to teach and arm schoolchildren as young as 3 to use firearms to protect themselves. (Children who are younger are not ideal, Morad says, because of ‘the terrible twos.’) That he finds willing advocates in the gun lobby … to join his effort is not all that surprising. It’s not even surprising that he finds a rather pathetic bunch of current and former lawmakers … to tape enthusiastic endorsements for Kinderguardians. ### “Instead, the surprising thing is that this all seems normal. Whatever shame or embarrassment might once have accompanied an unflattering appearance in one of Cohen’s elaborate stunts hardly matters anymore. We’re fresh out of shame in this country right now. Whatever blows Cohen might land by way of exposing hypocrisy — well, that doesn’t seem to have much effect anymore. … If nothing else, ‘Who Is America?’ might cause its audience to examine its own double standards. To giggle at and delight in Cohen’s pranks is to believe that you can have it both ways: that you can be horrified at the collapse of truth and democracy, and then laugh at a guy who seeks to undermine whatever remains of trust. As watchably galling as Cohen’s techniques may be, America in 2018 doesn’t really seem like the right time or place for it.” ### -- “[I]t becomes clear that Baron Cohen — a consummate troll himself — is a perfect foil to the current political climate of grift and trolling,” BuzzFeed News’s Charlie Warzel writes . “As the last two years have shown, the #MAGA style of politics is less an ideology than it is about breaking the system through an insurgent style of media hacking and alternate-reality creation. … Though the stakes may be somewhat lower, Baron Cohen’s brand of comedy wields a similar kind of recklessness. … He wholly rejects the ‘they go low, we go high’ ethos, opting instead to wrestle in the mud with his subjects. … Baron Cohen is a worthy adversary for the most disingenuous in our politics and culture. He pits bad faith against bad faith and the result is something that seems like the truth — but it isn’t easy to watch. And somehow, that feels fitting for our current moment.” ### GET SMART FAST:​​ ### France defeated Croatia 4-2 in the World Cup championship final.

But in the run-up to this year’s midterms, Republicans in the region are seeking to highlight their differences with the commander in chief — and the ways they could act as a check on his unpredictable behavior. David Weigel reports from New Albany, Ohio: “Ohio overall swung dramatically toward Trump in 2016, part of a near sweep of the Midwest … But doubts about the ongoing tariff battle and about the administration’s agenda on health care, spending and immigration have changed the terrain. Rather than back the president and Republicans, the Midwest has begun to flirt with candidates who would keep them in check. In Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio, Democratic senators once thought to be endangered have rebounded and are in fairly safe positions . . . Republicans in the region have been forced into a difficult choice. They can declare independence … Or they can side with a president whose actions, while popular among Republicans, are decidedly not so among other voters who will decide November’s elections.” ### -- Obamacare has transformed from a Republican attack point to a Democratic rallying cry. Sean Sullivan reports : “Democratic candidates and groups are trumpeting support for popular elements of President Barack Obama’s signature law and attacking Republicans for trying to rescind them in last year’s failed repeal-and-replace effort. Liberal activists are also seeking to convince centrist senators that confirmation of Trump’s new Supreme Court nominee … would increase the odds that the law known as Obamacare would be dismantled by the courts. The strategy marks a dramatic turnabout from the previous two midterms when many Democrats avoided defending Obamacare, and illustrates the extent to which the law has taken root as millions of Americans have come to depend on it.” ### -- Trump’s campaign tactics are gaining in popularity with candidates on both sides of the aisle. Jenna Johnson reports : “In races across the country, other Republican candidates — and some Democrats — also are branding their opponents with unflattering nicknames, tweeting in all caps, refusing to apologize for things that politicians once apologized for, being proudly politically incorrect, circulating false information, calling their hometown newspapers “fake news,” releasing damaging information about their opponents and generating controversy to get headlines, even unflattering ones. A Republican candidate for California’s state legislature, copying Trump’s foray against President Barack Obama, has even  launched a birther movement , demanding proof that his Democratic opponent is a legal citizen of the United States. … But it’s unclear if the tactics will work for many candidates other than Trump, who had a cache with his voters unmatched by most seeking office.” ### -- Trump has raised $90 million for his reelection campaign, with less money going toward legal fees. Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Anu Narayanswamy report : “Trump’s campaign committee and two fundraising committees that are joint operations with the Republican National Committee — Trump Victory and the Trump Make America Great Again Committee — together raised $17.7 million in the second quarter, for a total of about $90 million in the 2018 cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records filed Sunday evening. … [The campaign’s] attorneys' fees totaled $338,254, or less than 10 percent of the $3.6 million it spent from April through June, filings show. That represents a drop of nearly $500,000 since the first quarter of 2018, and a notable decline from the last quarter of 2017, when legal fees surged to $1.1 million.” ### -- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes has raised millions of dollars from grass-roots contributors eager to reward the California Republican for backing Trump against Russia collusion accusations. The Washington Examiner’s David M. Drucker reports : “[Nunes] closed the period with $5.7 million in cash on hand to spend on his re-election campaign. The congressman's second quarter haul is nearly three-and-a-half times the remarkable $1.25 million he raised in the first three months of the year, and comes after his political team invested in a national small-dollar fundraising program that kicked off after the House Intelligence Committee completed its investigation into the 2016 presidential campaign. … Nunes' colleagues are taking notice as well. The congressman is in-demand as a campaign surrogate, and is scheduled in the next three months to travel the country raising money for incumbents, challengers, and open-seat candidates.” ### Secretary of Defense James Mattis arrives Friday at Olso International Airport. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images) ### ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN: ### -- As Trump spent the bulk of his Europe trip lashing out at U.S. allies and upbraiding NATO, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has taken the opposite tack — keeping such a low profile that he’s oftentimes appeared nearly invisible. Greg Jaffe and Missy Ryan report : “On the rare occasions he has spoken, the Pentagon chief did not refer to his boss. Mattis traveled with Trump to the NATO summit in Brussels but remained offstage when [Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton] joined Trump during the president’s impromptu news conference. … Even as senior Pentagon officials insist they have never been more united, Mattis often seems to be having a different conversation with allies than Trump. His defense strategy, published in December, stresses the importance of alliances, especially in Europe, and orders the U.S. military to ramp up its capabilities to counter the threat posed by Russia.” ### Former Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel said Trump’s remarks put Mattis in an almost “untenable position”: “He can’t dismiss what the president said, so he’s got to finesse it. [Mattis] has, at times, sought to ‘finesse it’ by ignoring in public any presidential statements that seem to run counter to [his] overall approach to the military.” ### “Despite Trump’s statements in Brussels and Britain, Mattis has a positive story to tell about NATO, said current and former defense officials. Mattis is ‘winning the war’ in terms of securing support for Pentagon initiatives, such as a new NATO training mission in Iraq … The alliance also committed last week to a Mattis-backed proposal [on rapid deployments, which are] seen as essential to counter any Russian aggression on NATO’s eastern periphery. ### “Mostly, though, Mattis continued to strike a posture that was the tonal opposite of his boss. ‘I reiterate that I am here to listen,’ he said in Zagreb. ‘You live here, and each of you knows this neighborhood best.’” ### -- Another top National Security Council member announced her resignation — becoming the latest senior official to head for the exits since Bolton took over. Jennifer Arangio served as director for international organizations and alliances on the council, but she had reportedly clashed with others in the White House — including senior policy aide Stephen Miller — over Trump’s immigration crackdown and hard line policies toward refugees. ( Vox News ) ### -- House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) said he will not support the push by Trump loyalists to impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. “For what? Impeach him for what? No,” Gowdy said on CBS's “Face the Nation.” He added, “I've had my differences with Rod Rosenstein. I talk to him quite often privately, which again is a lot more constructive than the public hearings we have. … He's a Trump appointee. So is [Attorney General] Jeff Sessions. So is [FBI Director] Chris Wray. If President Trump is dissatisfied with Rod Rosenstein, he can fire him with a tweet.” ( Politico ) ### -- The FBI’s 2018 internal “climate survey” found that, under Trump, rank-and-file confidence in the bureau’s senior leadership has taken a direct hit. Lawfare Blog’s Benjamin Wittes and Scott Anderson published the results: “Across an array of metrics, both at headquarters and in the FBI’s 56 field offices, employees still express high esprit de corps about the FBI itself and their work for the bureau. But when asked about confidence in the vision of the FBI director, the value of direct communications from him, the honesty and integrity of senior bureau leaders, or respondents’ respect for those leaders, there is a striking drop in confidence from previous years.” ### -- Jared Kushner’s family company used loud construction and rent hikes to push out those in rent-stabilized apartments in favor of luxury condo buyers. From the AP’s Bernard Condon and Garance Burke : “The hammering and drilling began just months after [Kushner’s] family real estate firm bought a converted warehouse apartment building in the hip, Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Tenants say it started early in the morning and went on until nightfall, so loud that it drowned out normal conversation, so violent it rattled pictures off the walls. So much dust wafted through ducts and under doorways that it coated beds and clothes in closets. Rats crawled through holes in the walls. … [O]ver the past three years, more than 250 rent-stabilized apartments — 75 percent of the building — were either emptied or sold as the Kushner Cos. was converting the building to luxury condos. Those sales so far have totaled more than $155 million, an average of $1.2 million per apartment.” “You have to be ignorant or dumb to think this wasn’t deliberate,” one former resident said. ### -- Canada’s largest department store, Hudson's Bay, pulled Ivanka Trump’s merchandise from its website and confirmed it will begin “winding down” sales of her eponymous clothing line at their chain of brick-and-mortar stores. The New York Times’s Ian Austen reports : “The move by the retailer, which also owns Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor … comes at a time when many Canadians say they are boycotting American products because of [Trump’s] decision to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum as well as his repeated insults of [Justin Trudeau] . . . More than 2,000 Canadians responded to a recent request from [the Times] for their reaction to Mr. Trump’s actions with a mix of anger, betrayal, bafflement and sadness. Hudson’s Bay has also been targeted by several campaigns … that urge consumers to stay away from retailers that offer Trump family merchandise. In a brief statement, Hudson’s Bay made no reference to boycotts . . . Instead, it suggested that Ms. Trump’s brand was not particularly successful.” ### Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leads a cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. (Sebastian Scheiner/AP) ### THE NEW WORLD ORDER: ### -- A trove of Iranian nuclear documents stolen by Israeli intelligence during a daring raid earlier this year are shedding new light on the extent of Tehran’s past weapons research, including evidence that the country had obtained explicit weapons-design information from a foreign source and was nearing the development of critical weapons technology before the research was halted.  Joby Warrick reports from Tel Aviv : “Iran’s ambitious, highly secretive effort to build nuclear weapons included extensive research in making uranium metal as well as advanced testing of equipment used to generate neutrons to start a nuclear chain reaction … While Iranian officials halted much of the work in 2003, internal memos show senior scientists making extensive plans to continue several projects in secret, hidden within existing military research programs. ’The work would be divided in two: covert (secret structure and goals) and overt,’ an Iranian scientist writes in one memo, part of a 100,000-document archive seized in a daring raid [of the storage facility] … The stolen documents contain no revelations about recent nuclear activity and no proof that Iran has violated the 2015 nuclear accord [and] U.S. officials had long known of Iran’s pre-2004 nuclear weapons research, which the Obama administration cited explicitly in prodding Iran to accept the historic deal[.]” ### -- “How Israel, in Dark of Night, Torched Its Way to Iran’s Nuclear Secrets,” by the New York Times’s David E. Sanger and Ronen Bergman : “The agents arrived that night, Jan. 31, with torches that burned at least 3,600 degrees, hot enough, as they knew from intelligence collected during the planning of the operation, to cut through the 32 Iranian-made safes. But they left many untouched, going first for the ones containing the black binders, which contained the most critical designs. When time was up, they fled for the border, hauling some 50,000 pages and 163 compact discs of memos, videos and plans. … The morning shift of Iranian guards would arrive around 7 a.m., a year of surveillance of the warehouse by the Israeli spy agency had revealed, and [the Mossad agents] knew exactly how much time they had to disable the alarms, break through two doors, cut through dozens of giant safes and get out of the city with a half-ton of secret materials …” ### -- Theresa May says Trump told her that Britain should “sue” the European Union for a quicker Brexit. Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim report : “'He told me I should sue the E.U. — not go into negotiations. Sue them. Actually, no, we’re going into negotiations with them,’ May told the BBC in an interview that published Sunday. It is unclear how such a lawsuit would work for Britain, a member of the European Union, but Trump has often threatened lawsuits in dealmaking. The two leaders have disagreed on how May should handle the exit from the bloc, with Trump frequently haranguing her to hurry the process. Trump has often begun phone calls with her by asking her to rush the process.” ### -- The Trump administration is seeking direct talks with Taliban officials in the hopes of negotiating an end to America’s longest war. The New York Times’s Mujib Mashal and Eric Schmitt report : “The shift to prioritize initial American talks with the Taliban over what has proved a futile ‘Afghan-led, Afghan-owned’ process stems from a realization by both Afghan and American officials that [Trump’s] new Afghanistan strategy is not making a fundamental difference in rolling back Taliban gains. While no date for any talks has been set, and the effort could still be derailed, the willingness of the United States to pursue direct talks is an indication of the sense of urgency in the administration to break the stalemate in Afghanistan.” ### -- South Korean conservatives, who initially had high hopes for Trump’s presidency, have strongly opposed his outreach to Kim Jong Un. Adam Taylor reports : “In a nation where the political right has long based its policies on deep animosity toward North Korea and unfailing support for the U.S. military alliance, conservatives now find themselves dealing with an American leader who is not only willing to meet with and praise Kim, but who publicly muses about withdrawing troops. South Korea’s rightists are in the midst of a full-blown identity crisis. And the effect can be seen in electoral votes and opinion polls.” ### With the Supreme Court building in the background, Judge Brett Kavanaugh arrives for meetings last week on Capitol Hill. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) ### THE SUPREME COURT: ### -- “On abortion and other issues, Kavanaugh’s heroes are more conservative than Kennedy,” by  Robert Barnes and Ann E. Marimow : “Both Kavanaugh and now-Justice Neil M. Gorsuch subscribe to an originalist interpretation of the Constitution associated with Justice Clarence Thomas and the late Justice Antonin Scalia, and clearly not with [Anthony] Kennedy. [Both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh clerked for Kennedy.] . . . In his speeches and writings, Kavanaugh is often noncommittal, describing in detail how different justices on the Supreme Court approach cases rather than offering what he thinks would be the best way. But it is clear he would look to the approach employed by Scalia and [the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist]. Kavanaugh thinks the Constitution affords the executive branch broad powers. At the same time, he would be far less likely than other judges to declare a law ambiguous and thus defer to an administration’s agency interpretations of regulations and implementation.” ### -- There is growing focus on Kavanaugh's record vis-a-vis the rule of law. “He would very specifically and most profoundly exempt the president from [special counsel investigations],” Bob Bauer and Ryan Goodman write on Slate . “Indeed, Kavanaugh would go much further in exempting the president not only from prosecution and indictment but also from Department of Justice investigations while in office — and not only investigation but also depositions or questioning in civil litigation or criminal investigations. Under Kavanaugh’s proposal for a revamped prosecutorial structure, the president could nominate a special prosecutor to investigate alleged wrongdoing in the executive branch, but the president could never be one of the investigation’s targets. … What’s more, Kavanaugh’s proposals for a reform of the independent counsel arrangement would leave the president with unfettered authority to protect his own administration from accountability under the law.” ### -- “Ed Kavanaugh’s career may shed light on his son’s hostility to government regulation, a major reason conservatives are so enthralled by his nomination to the Supreme Court,” the New York Times’s Scott Shane, Steve Eder, Rebecca R. Ruiz, Adam Liptak, Charlie Savage and Ben Protess report . “He spent more than two decades in Washington as a top lobbyist for the cosmetics industry, courting Congress and combating regulations from the [FDA] and other agencies. … In current parlance, as an old friend put it, the elder Mr. Kavanaugh and his associates were ‘swamp creatures,’ using money and connections to fend off demands for safer products and greater transparency about ingredients. He was a golf partner of Tip O’Neill … who weighed in to support Martha Kavanaugh’s nomination to a judgeship. He was paid $13 million, including his retirement package, in 2005, his last year at the Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrance Association.” ### Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks during a Rally Against Separation in Boston. (Winslow Townson/AP) ### 2020 WATCH: ### -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been taking the most definitive steps recently to prepare for a run against Trump, but three of her colleagues — Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) — as well as former vice president Joe Biden are not far behind her. The New York Times’s Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin, who spoke to nearly 50 Democtatic insiders, report : “All five have been traveling the country, raising money for Democrats and gauging the appeal of their personalities and favorite themes. As a group, they are a strikingly heterogeneous array of rivals for Mr. Trump, embodying the Democratic Party’s options for defining itself: They are distinguished by gender and race, span three decades in age and traverse the ideological and tonal spectrum between combative Democratic socialism and consensus-minded incrementalism. Yet absent, at least so far, is either an obvious political phenom like [Barack Obama] or an establishment-backed juggernaut in the mold of Hillary Clinton. Unlike the last few Democratic primaries, the unsettled race evokes the sprawling nomination fights of earlier decades — lacking a dominant figure and seemingly inviting new leaders to rise. ### “Interviews with about four dozen lawmakers, consultants and party leaders revealed a mood of emphatic uncertainty: Senior Democrats see their party in a historically volatile state, and they are wary of attempting another Clinton-style coronation. But many Democrats believe the party’s turn left, combined with the rising fury of progressive women and the grass-roots appetite for a political brawler, have created an especially inviting environment for Ms. Warren.” ### -- Mayors are also muscling their way into the 2020 presidential race at a never-before-seen rate — with at least three Democratic city leaders already weighing potential bids. Politico’s David Siders reports: “No mayor has ever sprung directly from City Hall to the White House. But that historic streak stands to be tested in 2020 … [The mayors are] exploiting a newfound opening for politicians at the municipal level, one enabled by broader economic and cultural forces, among them the rise of the Democratic Party’s diverse and ascendant Obama coalition. … In part, the opportunity for Democratic mayors is a product of the party’s failings elsewhere. With Democrats out of power in Washington and in many state capitals, large, heavily Democratic cities have become progressives’ power centers of last resort, with an increasingly diverse media landscape offering exposure to a previously anonymous class of politicians.” ### “Cities are powerful forces now; they’re almost like city-states,” said former San Antonio mayor Henry Cisneros. “While it is perfectly plausible that a governor … can run, [why isn’t] it plausible that a mayor of a major, global epicenter of power like New York or Los Angeles or Chicago … shouldn’t be plausible at the presidential level?” ### -- Many people in the business and political spheres are encouraging Starbucks founder Howard Schultz not to run for president. Politico’s Ben Schreckinger reports : “Wall Street analysts are wary, and company leadership is nervous, about the effect a Democratic bid by its chairman emeritus could have on Starbucks’ business, given its bipartisan customer base. If that weren’t discouraging enough, his retirement last month set off a boomlet of pundits urging him not to run. And his recent appearance at a private gathering of political donors convened by Mitt Romney inspired indifference.” ### Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez departs after a press conference in New York. (Peter Foley/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) ### THE DEMOCRATIC CIVIL WAR: ### -- “Is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Win a Fluke or a Harbinger?” by the New Yorker's David Remnick : “Not long ago, [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez was mixing margaritas. Today, she is the embodiment of anti-corporate politics and a surge of female candidates in the midterm elections. … [Over] dinner, Ocasio-Cortez bris­tled at the establishment dismissals, [including Nancy Pelosi, who called her victory a ‘local phenomenon’]. She did not doubt that there were many factors in her win—her identity as a young woman, as a Latina, as a daugh­ter of a working-class family—but she had also out-organized a party boss, hammered away at immigration and health-care issues, and brought out new voters. ‘I’m twenty-eight years old, and I was elected on this super-idealistic plat­form,’ she said. ‘Folks may want to take that away from me, but I won. When you hear ‘She won just for demographic reasons,’ or low turnout, or that I won because of all the white ‘Bernie bros’ in Astoria—maybe that all helped. But I smoked this race. I dominated. And I am going to own that.’ … The more complicated question was how she was going to own her identity as a democratic socialist.” ### -- Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) took personal responsibility for his primary loss to Ocasio-Cortez in his first extended interview since the election. “This loss is on me,” Crowley told Margaret Brennan on “Face the Nation.” “I did not do as I preach. You know, I talk about all politics being local. I didn’t remind folks of my accomplishments. I didn’t talk about what I had done to help people in my district . . . I just took that for granted, I think.” Crowley, who got into a Twitter spat with Ocasio-Cortez just three days earlier, added that Democrats should focus on defeating Republicans rather than fighting internally. “What we really need to do is take that energy that’s been focused in terms of internal bouts and focus that on Republicans and win seats that Republicans hold today if we really want to make a difference,” Crowley said.

Miller: “Across the country, mothers and fathers are slowly being reunited with the children they last saw being led away by Border Patrol agents weeks or months ago. Experts warn that many of these children may be deeply traumatized by their experiences. Their voices have seldom been heard during the frenzied debate over family separation. ‘I felt like a prisoner,’ said Diogo De Olivera Filho, a 9-year-old from Brazil who spent five weeks at a shelter in Chicago, including three weeks in isolation after getting chickenpox.

The new tariffs announced Thursday would hit $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, especially consumer goods, including the popular hats sported by Trump supporters around the nation … David Lassoff is the manager of a California-based company that sells a range of novelty items online. He told ABC News his company, IncredibleGifts, typically imports the red hats from China and embroiders them in the U.S. But now the company may have to complete both tasks in the U.S., which could raise prices significantly.” “There might be a limited quantity [of hats] in the future. We’re trying to make sure we have enough hats in stock now, so if things change, we’re prepared,” he said. ###  ### HOT ON THE RIGHT ### “Former congressman Joe Walsh explains how Sacha Baron Cohen tricked him into supporting arming toddlers with guns,” from Travis M.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) ### Purchase: Order Reprint ### HELSINKI — With rattled world capitals watching, President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin are ready to go one-on-one in a summit that plays out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the investigation into Russian election meddling and fears that Moscow's aggression may go unpunished. ### Monday's meeting was condemned in advance by an assortment of members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump's presidential campaign. Undeterred, the American president is set to go face-to-face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompting a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a witch hunt. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV spectacle that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin's primary mission was simply the occurrence of the summit. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington could find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one-on-one in the Finnish presidential palace's opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will then take questions at a press conference before going their separate ways. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow's attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America's closest allies, as a ""foe."" ### ""I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,"" Trump said. ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump's jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over ""delinquent"" defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### And on the eve of his meeting with Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump unleashed a series of attacks on the media as Air Force One descended into Helsinki, complaining that Democrats and the press were unlikely to give him credit for any summit accomplishments. ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" Trump tweeted. ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!"" ### In his next tweet, he congratulated Putin on hosting ""one of the best ever"" World Cup tournaments. ### ""Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, ""not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime."" ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week — another chaotic stop on his European tour — that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said ""certainly I'll be asking about it"" although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can't force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a ""shameful comedy"" staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn't contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria's border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia's carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level."

But in advance of the talks, Trump listed a series of topics that did not include Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. ### ""We have not been getting along well for the last number of years,"" Trump said after arriving at the Presidential Palace in Finland's capital, where the leaders are meeting. ""But I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship. ... I really think the world wants to see us get along."" ### Putin, for his part, said he and Trump have maintained regular contact through phone calls and meetings at international events but ""the time has come to have a thorough discussion on various international problems and sensitive issues."" He added: ""There are quite a few of them for us to pay attention to."" ### Their opening one-on-one session had been scheduled to run 90 minutes. The Russians said it lasted two hours and 10 minutes. The White House wouldn't immediately confirm the timing. ### The summit, which is being closely watched around the world, was not the first time Trump and Putin have held talks. They met on the sidelines of world leader meetings in Germany and Vietnam last year. But Monday's session was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump's presidential campaign. ### Trump said last week that he would raise the meddling issue again with Putin, but questions have been swirling about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the interference that prompted a special investigation probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."" ### Addressing reporters before the one-on-one meeting, Putin struck a casual pose during Trump's remarks, slouching in his chair with his legs wide and eyes low. He nodded along to some of Trump's remarks before they were translated, showcasing his fluency in English. Trump leaned forward in his chair, his hands tented in front of him and frequently glanced over at the Russian president. At one point, he shot Putin a wink. After Trump concluded his remarks, American reporters shouted several questions about whether he would bring up election meddling during his discussions with Putin. ### Trump did not respond; Putin appeared to smirk. ### With that, the leaders gave a quick handshake and their private meeting in the opulent Gothic Hall was under way. Just the two of them, each with a translator. ### They continued the discussion with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. They'll conclude the summit by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Out on the streets, the summit attracted a grab-bag of protesters, with abortion-rights activists wearing artificially bulging bellies and Trump masks, anti-fascist protesters bearing signs with expletive-laden insults, and free traders, anti-war Ukrainians and gay rights supporters making their voices heard. ### The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States — and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea — for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow's aggression may go unchallenged. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming ""many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" ### The Russian foreign ministry responded by liking Trump's tweet and then replying: ""We agree."" ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian's leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British queen, among many others. ### Several dozen Trump supporters, many waving American flags and sporting ""Make America Great Again"" caps, cheered Trump near his waterfront hotel in Helsinki. Two held up a handwritten banner that read ""God Bless D & M Trump."" ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn't ""expect anything"" from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders met alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. Not mentioned: Election meddling or Syria. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a ""shameful comedy"" they claim has been staged to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties. ### In tweets Monday, Trump continued to undermine the investigation and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor. He claimed Obama ""was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it."" ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or the easing of crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action.

During Putin's 18 years in power he's met every U.S. President since Bill Clinton. ### George W. Bush said he looked into Putin's eyes to get a sense of his soul, while President Obama sought a ""reset"" in relations with Russia. ### But relations are at a low point -- circumstances which, in spite of Russia's meddling in U.S. democracy and unilateral annexation of Crimea from Ukraine , Mr. Trump blamed overnight squarely on his own predecessors in the United States. ### So, what does it mean to sit down and negotiate with Vladimir Putin? ### CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer says Putin came from nowhere in 2000 to become one of the most controversial and famous leaders on the planet. He's a complex personality and it has taken almost two decades for the West to understand how he operates. ### Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron, Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic and FIFA President Gianni Infantino attend the ceremony during which the World Cup trophy was awarded to Croatia, July 15, 2018. ### SPUTNIK/REUTERS ### Last night, during World Cup celebrations in the pouring rain, Putin stayed dry -- sheltered diligently by his loyal staff. Putin is often called a modern day czar. He walks and talks like a man in absolute control. ### Trained as a KGB agent during the Cold War, it is in Putin's DNA to view the United States as an adversary. He's an old-fashioned ""He-Man,"" says Palmer; the very opposite of politically correct. ### At the negotiating table, Putin's tactics are known to include mind games. He brought his dog to a meeting with the German leader Angela Merkel, who's afraid of them, and once kept President Obama waiting for 40 minutes. ### Putin is also populist who can turn on the charm, especially during his regular, epic ""Ask The President"" televised call-in shows. ### He loves wealth and the trappings of power, at almost any cost. Putin brazenly stood center stage at the Sochi Olympics while Russian athletes were doping on an industrial scale. ### He respects strength -- military and political. Putin has a black belt in judo, and opponents say he's nimble, and ruthless. ### John Cipher, a former CIA officer stationed in Moscow, says Putin is ""going to look for subtle signals and vulnerabilities that he can take advantage of in the meeting -- and a one-on-one meeting is the best opportunity to do that."" ### Vladimir Putin once said the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest catastrophe of the 20th Century. Everything he says and does is about reversing that collapse; in short, making Russia great again."
2549,washingtontimes.com,2018-07-15T07:06:47-04:00,"US official: Russia using social media to divide Americans ### Search ### Should President Trump withdraw the U.S. from NATO? ### Question of the Day ### Print ### By GEOFF MULVIHILL -          Associated Press -                         Saturday, July 14, 2018 ### PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The U.S. homeland security secretary said on Saturday there are no signs that Russia is targeting this year’s midterm elections with the same “scale or scope” it targeted the 2016 presidential election. ### Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen spoke at a convention of state secretaries of state, an event that’s usually a low-key affair highlighting voter registration, balloting devices and election security issues that don’t get much public attention. But coming amid fresh allegations into Russia’s attempts to sway the 2016 election, the sessions on election security have a higher level of urgency and interest. ### Nielsen said her agency will help state and local election officials prepare their systems for cyberattacks from Russia or elsewhere. She said U.S. intelligence officials are seeing “persistent Russian efforts using social media, sympathetic spokespeople and other fronts to sow discord and divisiveness amongst the American people, though not necessarily focused on specific politicians or political campaigns.” ### The conference of top state election officials she addressed was sandwiched between Friday’s indictments of 12 Russian military intelligence officers alleged to have hacked into Democratic party and campaign accounts and Monday’s long-awaited meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### Trump has never condemned Russia over meddling in the 2016 election despite the findings of all top U.S. intelligence agencies, and the Kremlin has insisted it didn’t meddle in the U.S. election. In the past, Trump has reiterated Putin’s denials, but this week he said he would bring up the issue when they meet on Monday in Finland. ### “All I can do is say, ‘Did you?’” Trump said days ago at a news conference in Brussels. “And, ‘Don’t do it again.’ But he may deny it.” ### Some of the state officials who run elections say it’s important for Trump, a Republican, to take a tougher stance to avoid having the public’s confidence in fair elections undermined. ### “I believe as commander in chief he has an obligation to address it and, frankly, put Putin and any other foreign nation that seeks to undermine our democracy on notice that the actions will not be tolerated,” California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said in an interview this week. ### Some of his peers declined to go that far. ### “I don’t go around telling the president what to do,” said Jay Ashcroft, the Republican secretary of state in Missouri. ### Trump portrays the investigation as a partisan attack, but not all Republicans see it that way. This month, the Republicans and Democrats on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee backed the findings of an assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election and acted in favor of Trump and against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. ### As part of that effort, Russian hackers targeted at least 21 states ahead of the election and are believed to have breached the voter registration system in at least one, Illinois, investigators say. Without naming the state, Friday’s indictment said the Russian intelligence officers stole information on about 500,000 voters from the website of one board of elections, a breach undetected for three weeks. ### There’s no evidence results were altered, but the attempts prompted the federal government and states to re-examine election systems and tighten their cybersecurity. ### Federal officials also say it’s possible that malware might have been planted that could tamper with voting or paralyze computer systems in future elections. ### The election officials talked about technical details of blocking an incursion. ### Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican, told her peers how her state is using its National Guard to help test and shore up cybersecurity for elections. She said it’s important to make it clear to voters that the military is not running elections and does not have access to election data. ### “The whole idea of this is to instill confidence in voters and the public that the system is secure,” Wyman said in an interview. ### Some state officials also said Homeland Security is becoming more helpful in sharing information. ### On Friday, a federal grand jury indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers on charges they hacked into Democratic campaign networks in 2016 and then stole and released tens of thousands of documents. The indictment says one of the intrusions came that summer, on a vendor whose software is used to verify voter registration information. The indictment references a spoof email it says the Russian agents sent to more than 100 election-managing customers of the vendor to try to get more information. ### “The indictments tell us that … no longer can we deny in any shape or form that Russians were involved,” said cybersecurity expert Sam Woolley, of the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, California. ### ___"

Undeterred, the American president is set to go face-to-face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompting a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a witch hunt. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV spectacle that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin's primary mission was simply the occurrence of the summit. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington could find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one-on-one in the Finnish presidential palace's opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will then take questions at a press conference before going their separate ways. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow's attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America's closest allies, as a ""foe."" ### ""I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,"" Trump said. ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump's jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over ""delinquent"" defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### And on the eve of his meeting with Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump unleashed a series of attacks on the media as Air Force One descended into Helsinki, complaining that Democrats and the press were unlikely to give him credit for any summit accomplishments. ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" Trump tweeted. ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!"" ### In his next tweet, he congratulated Putin on hosting ""one of the best ever"" World Cup tournaments. ### ""Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, ""not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime."" ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week — another chaotic stop on his European tour — that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said ""certainly I'll be asking about it"" although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can't force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a ""shameful comedy"" staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn't contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria's border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia's carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level. ### ___"

Lehtikuva/Antti Aimo-Koivisto via REUTERS ### More ### By Steve Holland and Andrew Osborn ### HELSINKI (Reuters) - After months of exchanging long-distance compliments, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin sit down on Monday for their first ever summit, a potential political minefield at home for the U.S. president but a geopolitical win for his Russian counterpart. ### Neither side expects major breakthroughs from the talks in the Finnish capital beyond warm words, an agreement to begin repairing battered U.S.-Russia relations, and maybe a deal to start talks on issues such as nuclear arms control and Syria. ### The two men, who have praised each other's leadership qualities from afar, could also agree to start restocking their respective embassies and returning confiscated diplomatic property after a wave of expulsions and retaliatory action prompted by the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. ### Ahead of the summit, both sides talked down the event, however, with Trump telling CBS he was going in with ""low expectations"" and John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, saying on ABC's ""This Week"" that the United States was not looking for ""deliverables"" and that the meeting would be ""unstructured."" ### Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russia's RT TV station that he also had low expectations. He would regard the summit as a success if there was an agreement to merely reopen severed lines of communications across the board, he said. ### For Putin, the fact that the summit is even happening despite Russia's semi-pariah status among some Americans and U.S. allies is a geopolitical win because, in Russian eyes, it shows that Washington recognizes Moscow as a great power whose interests must be taken into account. [nL8N1U7564] ### For Russia, it is also a powerful sign that Western efforts to isolate Moscow have failed. ### But for Trump, whose White House victory was actively supported by 12 Russian military intelligence agents, according to a recent U.S. indictment, and whose entourage is still being investigated for possible collusion with Moscow, the meeting is freighted with domestic political risk. [nL1N1UA05K] ### ""We can say confidently that Putin's political risks are lower than those of President Trump,"" said Andrey Kortunov, head of RIAC, a Moscow think-tank close to the Russian Foreign Ministry. ### ""Putin has less to lose and more to gain because he does not have a domestic opposition, a potentially hostile legislature, and is not begin investigated like Trump. But if you look at the U.S. media they mostly focus on potential risks. Nobody there really believes that any good can come out of this summit."" ### A probe over allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election has clouded Trump's presidency. Trump has denied any collusion with the Russians by his campaign and Russia denies it meddled. ### The Helsinki summit is the capstone to a nearly week-long trip for Trump during which he has sown doubts about his commitment to the NATO military alliance, Washington's so-called special relationship with Britain, and U.S. relations with the European Union that he called ""a foe"" in trade terms. [nL8N1UB0KN] ### Against that backdrop and swirling uncertainty about what Trump might do or say next, his summit with Putin, which will include a one-on-one session with the Russian leader with only interpreters present, has both U.S. allies and U.S. politicians worried lest he make hasty and sweeping concessions. ### U.S. FEARS ### Some politicians in the West believe the summit is happening at one of the most crucial junctures for the West since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Certain NATO allies fear Putin might seek a grand deal that would undermine the U.S.-led transatlantic alliance. [nL8N1U94L9] ### Trump has said that he will raise the alleged Russian election meddling with Putin but does not expect to get anywhere, has spoken vaguely about the possibility of halting NATO war games in the Baltic region, and has said repeatedly that it would be good if he could get along with Russia. ### When asked last month if he would recognize Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, he replied: ""We're going to have to see."" [nL1N1TV232] ### On Friday, 12 Russians were indicted on charges of interfering in the U.S. 2016 election, a development that prompted some Democratic leaders to call on Trump to cancel the Putin meeting, a demand he quickly dismissed. ### On the summit's eve, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, a political opponent of Trump, said he had told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the Helsinki meeting was a mistake. ### ""First, I don't believe the meeting should take place but if it is going to happen, President Trump must press Putin hard on the issue of election interference. He can't simply raise it, accept Putin's denial and then let him off the hook,"" Schumer said in a statement. ### ""Second, the President must demand that the 12 Russians named in the indictment be sent to the U.S. to stand trial. And third, President Trump should not agree to weaken, lift, or curtail any of the sanctions on Russia."" ### Any Trump request for Russia to extradite hacking suspects is likely to fall on deaf ears, however, as the Kremlin, citing the Russian constitution, has a policy of not handing over suspects wanted by other countries. ### Many Western politicians remain angry over Russia's annexation of Crimea, its backing of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, and its support for Syria's Bashar al-Assad. ### Other accusations, denied by Moscow, include that it meddled in European politics, supplied the weapon that shot down a passenger plane in 2014 over Ukraine, and was behind the poisoning of the former Russian spy in Britain. ### Moscow would love to have U.S. sanctions - initially imposed over the Crimea annexation - eased and eventually lifted. But most in Russia do not expect the summit to produce such an outcome. ### (Reporting by Steve Holland and Andrew Osborn, additional reporting by Jeff Mason; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)"

Trump's national security adviser said they aren't looking for ""concrete deliverables."" ### Trump also says he ""hadn't thought"" about asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in Washington on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but says ""certainly I'll be asking about it."" ### He blamed the Democratic National Committee for ""allowing themselves to be hacked."" ### The U.S. has no extradition treaty with Moscow and can't compel Russia to hand over citizens, and a provision in Russia's constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens to foreign countries. ### Asked whether Trump would ask Putin to turn over the 12 military intelligence officials, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton called the idea ""pretty silly"" and said doing so would put the president in a ""weak position."" ### He said Trump is going into the summit with a stronger hand because of the indictments. ### ""I think the president can put this on the table and say, 'This is a serious matter that we need to talk about,'"" Bolton said. He said asking for the indicted Russians to be turned over would have the opposite effect. ### ""For the president to demand something that isn't going to happen puts the president in a weak position, and I think the president has made it very clear he intends to approach this discussion from a position of strength."" ### In the interview with CBS News, Trump said he's entering the meeting in Finland with ""low expectations. I'm not going with high expectations."" ### Trump taped the interview Saturday in Scotland. CBS News released excerpts Sunday, hours before Trump was set to fly to Helsinki for the summit. Trump said such sessions are beneficial. He cited his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June as ""a good thing"" and says ""having meetings with Russia, China, North Korea, I believe in it."" ### ""Nothing bad is going to come out of it (Helsinki), and maybe some good will come out,"" he said. ### Trump and Putin have met twice before, during international summits last year in Germany and in Vietnam. But Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, says Monday's meeting ""is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation and I hope it's a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests."" ### The president opened his first meeting with Putin -- it lasted more than two hours last July in Hamburg, Germany -- by pressing Putin on Russian election meddling and Putin denied being involved, according to U.S. officials who described the meeting afterward. ### Congressional Democrats and at least one Republican have called on the president to pull out of Monday's meeting unless he is willing to make Russian election-meddling the top issue. Huntsman said the meeting must go on because some international issues can't be solved without Russian engagement. ### ""Right now, there's no trust in the relationship and, because of that, problem-solving is practically impossible,"" Huntsman said. ""So this is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama and quite frankly some of the danger out of the relationship right now."" ### Huntsman added: ""The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off-the-charts high so it's a good thing these presidents are getting together."" ### Trump has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling, along with Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation and other topics. Bolton described the meeting as ""unstructured,"" saying: ""We're not looking for concrete deliverables here."" ### Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., meanwhile, suggested that Trump not even bother to press Putin on election meddling because ""he's not going to admit that he did it.""

But things don't go according to plan in this new novel by Keith Gessen. ### Russia — And Grandma — Defy Expectations In 'A Terrible Country' ### Embed ### Embed ### Russia — And Grandma — Defy Expectations In 'A Terrible Country' ### Russia — And Grandma — Defy Expectations In 'A Terrible Country' ### Embed ### Embed ### Independent Booksellers ### It's the summer of 2008, and Andrei Kaplan doesn't have a whole lot going for him in New York. Money's tight, his girlfriend dumped him, and, at 33, his academic career has stalled. So, at the urging of his brother, he returns to Russia, where he was born, to take care of his aging grandmother, Baba Seva. ### Andrei's fantasy is that he will arrive in Moscow and Baba Seva will tell him stories of Stalinist Russia that he can turn into an academic article to jump-start his career. But that doesn't really pan out, says journalist and translator Keith Gessen, author of the novel A Terrible Country. ### ""Once he gets there he's disappointed to find that his grandmother hardly remembers who he is, much less various details about Stalinist Russia,"" Gessen explains. ### Interview Highlights ### On Russia not fitting his expectations ### He reads the news about Russia a lot and he really expects when he gets there to find this place that is under a terrible dictatorship. People are oppressed. You know, he thinks he's going to show up and possibly get arrested at the airport. And instead he finds that the country has become quite rich. Everybody's walking around, talking on sleek little cell phones. They all seem to be driving fancy German cars. It's not what he expected. ### On Russian attitudes toward wealth ### Andrei leaves this country, [the U.S.], where he found himself measured all the time by whether or not he had money. ... And he shows up in Russia to find that it's the exact same thing — that Russians have very much adopted these values of thinking that the amount of money you have is a sign of your success and your virtue and that those people who weren't able to make money in the post-Soviet period ... who are suffering or are barely getting by — that they deserve to suffer. ### On the demographic changes Andrei sees in Moscow ### It has gone through radical gentrification and most of the ... old school Soviet people — a lot of whom were elderly, who were living in the center of the city — have basically been priced out, some of them quite violently. There were a lot of scams in the '90s where elderly people who had prime real estate in Moscow had bad things happen to them. ### On Baba Seva making ends meet ### His grandmother is one of the few kind of holdovers in this part of the city who is from the old days who has very little cash [and] is basically living off her pension. She has this kind of Soviet geography ... she knows which store has the cheapest cheese, which store has the cheapest butter, which store has the cheapest cucumbers. And Andrei finds this very frustrating because to go on a shopping trip with her takes at least three times as long as it has to. ### On the humor in the book ### Whenever I go over there I have the same reaction as I describe Andre having in the book, which is: I spend all this time reading about what's going on over there and a lot of it is really bad and then I get there and people are sitting in coffee shops. And, you know, you think: Are all these people just kind of living in illusion, or do they have to just go about their lives? And the answer is kind of kind of both, right? I mean, you can't live with a constant sense of how bad things are politically. You do have to go out and get coffee. ### Ian Stewart and Barrie Hardymon produced and edited this interview for broadcast. Beth Novey adapted it for the Web. ### Facebook"

2690,nytimes.com,2018-07-15T06:21:09-04:00,"Summit Fever: Trump Reaches for Big Moment With Putin ### By The Associated Press ### July 15, 2018 ### HELSINKI — A face-to-face sitdown with a long-feared foe. Endless media hype. Huge ratings. ### Although President Donald Trump has met with Russia's Vladimir Putin twice before, he is eager to recreate in Finland the heady experience that he had last month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore: a summit that became a mass media event complete with powerful presidential images. Ever the showman and insistent on establishing closer ties to Moscow, Trump overruled his advisers and demanded the rituals and pageantry of a formal summit. ### Trump had boasted to confidants about the number of cameras in Singapore, claiming it dwarfed coverage of the Oscars, according to a person familiar with his thinking but not authorized to discuss private conversations and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Though Trump originally expressed concern that Helsinki was not glamorous enough and favored hosting Putin at the White House, the president was reassured by aides that it would be an effective backdrop. And long believing in the power of personal connections, he has insisted to aides that it was essential to sit down with Putin to establish a rapport. ### ""He's been very nice to me the times I've met him. I've been nice to him. He's a competitor,"" Trump said of Putin last week in Brussels. ""You know, somebody was saying, 'Is he an enemy?' No, he's not my enemy. 'Is he a friend?' No, I don't know him well enough."" ### Drawing on his experience as a marketer and salesman, Trump has long been convinced that his mastery of powerful images has been essential to his political rise. The president has told advisers that the Singapore diplomacy made him look like a take-charge president. And it was not lost on him that his poll numbers received a temporary bump after the meeting. ### With the same attention to detail that he devoted to campaign ads, Trump masterminded many of the looks for his meeting with Kim, including the two leaders' dramatic initial greeting and handshake and, later, their one-on-one time. At one point, he startled the Secret Service by giving Kim an impromptu tour of some mighty American machinery — the presidential limousine known as ""The Beast."" ### Though the results from the North Korea summit are debatable, Trump has told confidants he believed it was a masterstroke, according to three outside advisers and White House officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. ### Always favoring bold gambits that would separate him from his predecessors, Trump believed that the historic meeting with Kim was potentially his ticket for a Nobel Peace Prize and would become an essential part of his legacy. While summits with Russian leaders are far more common, Trump believes a similar boost would occur if he can improve relations with Moscow and get Putin to make concessions never attained by President Barack Obama. ### ""I could say: 'Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Syria,'"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News last month. ""'Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Ukraine?'"" ### And while the imagery of Singapore made the idea of a Putin summit that much more tantalizing, Trump was already keen on setting up a one-on-one meeting, even with the risks entailed in meeting an experienced leader who is also a former KGB official. ### The president met with Putin on the sidelines of international summits last year — once in Germany, once in Vietnam — and both times he invited his Russian counterpart to the White House, according to three current and former administration officials. He reiterated the invitation on a call with Putin this spring and initially told aides that he wanted to have the meeting at the White House. ### He was later convinced to do it abroad, tacking the summit onto his planned visit to Belgium and Britain. Initially concerned that Helsinki was not a fitting location, Trump relented after being briefed on the history of U.S.-Russia summits in Finland and after seeing that it could be scheduled after a visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland, according to the three outside advisers and officials. ### But many in Washington are leery of the summit occurring anywhere, believing that just by agreeing to meet, Trump has offered further global legitimacy to Putin, who will preside over the World Cup final in Moscow the day before the summit. Aides have argued to Trump that the chances of substantive progress on a host of thorny issues, including Syria and Ukraine, are slim. ### Longtime American allies and White House aides alike have expressed concerns about the meeting. Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and the ongoing special counsel probe into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia.

2707,washingtonpost.com,2018-07-16T02:47:42-04:00,"Donald Trump Jr.’s emails are far more damning than anyone could have imagined ### (Adriana Usero,Kate Woodsome/The Washington Post) ### By Randall Eliason July 11, 2017 ### Randall D. Eliason teaches white-collar criminal law at George Washington University Law School. He blogs at Sidebarsblog.com . ### Donald Trump Jr. has just released the emails that led to his meeting in June 2016 with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Jaw-dropping is not too strong a term for them. ### As I wrote Monday , this meeting — also attended by President Trump’s then-campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner — is potentially a key piece of evidence in the investigation of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian nationals. ### (Elyse Samuels,Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) ### Trump Jr. had already admitted he attended the meeting after being informed by email that Veselnitskaya was offering to provide damaging information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But the emails themselves — which he posted on Twitter apparently after learning that the New York Times was about to publish them — are far more damning than anyone could have imagined. ### [ This law might explain why a Russian lawyer wanted to meet with Trump ] ### The email from Trump associate Rob Goldstone bears the subject line, “Russia-Clinton — private and confidential.” It says that the “Crown prosecutor of Russia” was offering to provide the Trump campaign “some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.” He explains this is “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” The emails describe Veselnitskaya as a “Russian government attorney.” ### Trump Jr.’s response to this offer: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer” — in other words, closer to the date of the election. He proceeded to set up the meeting, and told Goldstone that Kushner and Manafort would also attend. ### Wow — where to begin? First, the emails establish that the entire purpose of the meeting was to share potentially compromising information about Clinton. Trump Jr. and others have claimed the meeting was primarily about sanctions against Russia and the prohibition of U.S. adoptions of Russian children . Those topics are mentioned nowhere in the emails. ### The emails also make it perfectly clear that the source of the proffered information is the Russian government. The Trump team may have tried to characterize Veselnitskaya as a private Russian lawyer and to claim that they had no reason to think she was acting on behalf of the government of Russian President Vladi­mir Putin. But the emails could not be plainer that the proffered information is from the Russian government and “is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” ### [ The Donald Trump Jr. emails could hardly be more incriminating ] ### Finally, the email resolves any doubt about Trump Jr.’s state of mind concerning possible assistance from Putin. His “I love it” pretty much says it all. ### Any responsible campaign lawyer or campaign manager, when faced with this type of offer of assistance from the Russian government, would run screaming in the other direction. Hopefully he or she also would report it to the FBI. Team Trump apparently embraced it. In the thick of the campaign, three of Trump’s most senior and trusted advisers took the time to meet with a “Russian government attorney” to see what the Russian government had to offer. ### On Monday I referred to prosecutors building a wall of evidence, brick by brick, to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a possible conspiracy. With these emails, Donald Trump Jr. just delivered a wheelbarrow full of bricks to the special counsel’s office. ### Read more on this:"

I’ve never thought it was a witch hunt,” Rep. Trey Gowdy said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” ### “Russia attacked this country in 2016. That’s the number one thing we’ve asked Mueller to look at — what did Russia do,” the South Carolina Republican said. ### He said no Americans have yet been indicted for conspiring to affect the 2016 elections, but his focus is on what Russia did. ### “And that’s not a witch hunt. That’s an attack on our country,” Mr. Gowdy said. ### Mr. Trump is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin Monday in Helsinki, Finland, just days after the Department of Justice announced an indictment stemming from Mr. Mueller’s probe that accuses a dozen Russian military officers of stealing Democratic Party emails and trying to influence the 2016 elections. ### Mr. Gowdy said Mr. Trump’s first request of Mr. Putin should be to “tell us which airport we can pick up the 25 Russians that tried to interfere with the fundamentals of our democracy.” A previous indictment accused 13 Russians of using social media to sow divisions in the U.S. ### “If you really claim you had nothing to do with it that you should be as shocked as we were that your military was being used to impact our election,” Mr. Gowdy said. “Tell us where you’re going to extradite those folks because an American grand jury indicted them for undermining our democracy.” ### Appearing Sunday on ABC News, National Security Advisor John Bolton downplayed the notion that Russia could extradite any of the dozen military officers named in the new indictment, pointing out that the U.S. doesn’t have an extradition treaty with Russia. ### Mr. Gowdy also said there is “absolutely” an anti-Trump bias within the FBI. His committee recently heard testimony from FBI agent Peter Strzok, who has come under fire for sending anti-Trump messages during the 2016 campaign. ### The congressman also mentioned former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, with whom Mr. Strzok exchanged some of the messages and with whom he was having an extramarital affair. ### “Now, how pervasive it was beyond those two — I think there are four or five other unidentified bureau and department agents and employees who also had bias,” Mr. Gowdy said. “But there are 13,000 FBI agents and 99.9 percent of them are doing exactly what you would want them to do and exactly the way you would want them to do it.”"

She and her husband, Sergey, decided to flee Russia after the Supreme Court declared Jehovah’s Witness an “extremist” organization and effectively outlawed it in April last year.CreditJanne Korkko for The New York Times ### By Andrew Higgins ### July 16, 2018 ### TURKU, Finland — Sergey Avilkin, one of the hundreds of Russians now sheltering in Finland to avoid arrest as “extremists” in their home country, has no interest in politics or politicians and says that he has always followed the biblical injunction to “render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s.” ### But the 42-year-old father of three would still like President Trump to ask President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a simple question when the two leaders meet in Helsinki, the Finnish capital, on Monday: Why are Russians who pay their taxes, follow the law and embrace the Christian values promoted by the Kremlin being forced to flee their country? ### “We don’t steal, we don’t smoke, we don’t drink and always try to obey the law,” said Mr. Avilkin, sitting in the kitchen of the apartment he recently rented for his family in Turku, a city west of Helsinki, while he waits for Finland’s immigration service to process an application for asylum. “But I am 100 percent sure that if I had not left I would now be in prison.” ### Along with most of the other Russians who have sought shelter in Finland, Mr. Avilkin and his family are Jehovah’s Witnesses, a Christian denomination that the Russian Supreme Court declared an “extremist” organization and effectively outlawed in April last year. ### With issues like arms control, the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, and Russian meddling in the 2016 election in the United States expected to be discussed, it is unlikely that the two presidents will have the time — or the inclination — to address the fate of Russia’s Jehovah’s Witnesses when they meet. ### Image ### The Avilkin family rented an apartment in these blocks.CreditJanne Korkko for The New York Times ### But Mr. Avilkin, his wife, Lena, their three school-age children and around 300 other Russians scattered in refugee camps and low-rent housing around Finland are a stark reminder of the obstacles, rarely mentioned by Mr. Trump but still very real, that impede his desire to “get along with Russia.” ### The Russian court ruling, which put Bible-reading Christians who reject all violence in the same category of extremism as supporters of the Islamic State, set off a harsh crackdown across Russia. The Jehovah’s Witness headquarters near St Petersburg were seized by the state, prayer halls around the country were raided by the police and scores of believers were arrested. ### “What we have seen in Russia since the Jehovah’s Witness organization was banned outright last year is without doubt the most severe crackdown on religious freedom since the Soviet era,” said Geraldine Fagan, the author of “Believing in Russia — Religious Policy after Communism.” ### “In key respects, it is uncannily reminiscent of late Soviet-era practice,” Ms. Fagan added. ### The State Department has said it is “extremely concerned by the Russian government’s action targeting and repressing members of religious minorities, including Jehovah’s Witnesses, under the pretense of combating extremism.” ### But Mr. Trump, who won the 2016 election with strong support from evangelical Christians, has so far remained silent on the matter. ### Finland, like the rest of Europe, has years of experience dealing with asylum-seekers, but until Russia branded Jehovah’s Witnesses as extremists, those seeking refuge in the country were largely from the Middle East and Africa. ### Image ### “I am 100 percent sure that if I had not left I would now be in prison” Mr. Avilkin said, referring to Russia.CreditJanne Korkko for The New York Times ### Anu Karppi, an official in the asylum division of Finland’s immigration service, said that 293 Russians had applied for asylum in 2016, including homosexuals who said they faced persecution and others who fled for economic reasons. In 2017, after the crackdown on Jehovah’s Witnesses began, that number rose to 405. An additional 240 Russians have applied so far this year. Before 2017, only one Jehovah’s Witness from Russia requested asylum in Finland ### Ms. Karppi said applicants needed to establish that they faced a real risk, not just a fear, of persecution in order to gain asylum in Finland. The few applications processed so far have been rejected, and Ms. Karppi said that while Russia was certainly “enforcing measures” against Jehovah’s Witnesses, the severity of the campaign varied from region to region. ### “We look at every application case by case,” she said. “At the moment, the situation does not seem to be that every Jehovah’s Witness is under the threat of persecution, but we follow the situation closely. If everyone was being persecuted, then everyone would be granted asylum.” ### After initially targeting only male Jehovah’s Witnesses, Russian law-enforcement agencies this month arrested a woman, Anatastasiya Polyakova, a follower of the denomination in the Siberian city of Omsk. Her husband, Sergey, was also arrested, after being severely beaten during a police raid on their home. ### Forum 18, a Norwegian group that promotes religious freedom, reported that more than 50 Jehovah’s Witnesses are now under investigation in Russia on criminal charges of “extremism.” ### Unlike many religious groups, Jehovah’s Witnesses, who number more than 170,000 in Russia and more than eight million worldwide, have a policy of staying politically neutral and have not assembled a powerful lobbying machine in either Washington or Moscow. ### Image ### Members of the Kikot family, Jehovah’s Witnesses who fled Russia.CreditJanne Korkko for The New York Times ### The group’s distaste for politics and sometimes idiosyncratic theology, which puts it at odds with many other Christian denominations, has made the denomination an easy target in Russia, where the Orthodox Church, a close ally of the Kremlin, views Jehovah’s Witness as a heretical sect. ### Because followers generally do not vote and have a long record of resisting military service and all collaboration with the security services, they have no allies in Russia’s political and security establishments, which have united against them. ### Mr. Avilkin’s wife, Lena, recalled how doctors at a state hospital in Moscow where the couple took the daughter, Katya, for cancer treatment as a baby had, after consultation with Russian prosecutors, told them to “take your child away and let her die” after they refused to allow blood transfusions, which are banned by their faith. The couple later found a private doctor in St. Petersburg willing to operate without transfusions and their daughter, now a healthy 12-year-old, survived. ### The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2013 that the hospital had violated human rights by divulging the medical record of the Avilkins’ daughter to Russian prosecutors, who had demanded that public hospitals report all cases of Jehovah’s Witnesses who refused transfusions. ### The issue of transfusions has been at the center of a long campaign of criticism by Russian foes of the denomination, who include some medical professionals and disenchanted former followers, but are mostly people close to and sometimes funded by the Orthodox Church. ### While the decision by Jehovah’s Witnesses not to get involved in politics and their determination to live out the teachings of the Bible may be points in their favor in Russia, their lack of patriotic fervor and the fact the group’s worldwide headquarters is in the United States have made them deeply suspect in the eyes of the Orthodox Church and the Russian state. ### Image ### Valeri Kikot and his family live in a single room in Turku, sharing a kitchen with asylum seekers from Syria.CreditJanne Körkkö for The New York Times ### “In Putin’s eyes, they have no political value; what ‘traditional values’ they may have are of no use to him if they cannot be co-opted,” Ms. Fagan said. ### Valeri Kikot, another Jehovah’s Witness who fled to Finland, said he had made a good living in Russia running a small construction company and had benefited from the stability brought by Mr. Putin’s 18-years in power. ### “We had a good life,” he said. “I was never against Putin and, if the authorities had not turned against us, I would definitely have stayed in Russia.” ### Mr. Kikot, 55, now lives with his wife and two young children in a single room in a hulking building for refugees in Turku. They share a kitchen with asylum seekers from Syria. ### A committed atheist until he became a Jehovah’s Witness as an adult, Mr. Kikot said he had never imagined ending up as a refugee and had fled Russia only because he worried that the authorities might prosecute him and his wife, a former follower of the Russian Orthodox Church, and seize their children. ### “We understood that they could enter our house any day and take away our kids,” he said. “We had to leave.”"

Alarm bells went off when Trump said his upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin would be easier than those with NATO members and UK leadership. The indictments of 12 Russians charged with hacking the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s emails during the 2016 presidential campaign reaffirm the security concerns Russia poses — concerns NATO was originally designed to address. ### Simply put, Trump’s boorish display in Brussels on July 11 was a highlight reel of horrible. Trump went as far as to say that U.S. allies are “delinquent ” on payments they don’t, in fact, owe. He also claimed that Germany was “captive to Russia” because of its Russian oil and gas imports and a proposed natural gas pipeline. While Trump’s statements suggest he might prefer Putin’s friendship over those of U.S. allies, little has changed in terms of actual U.S. policy. However, what first was strategy now is farce. ### The indictments of 12 Russians charged with hacking the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s emails during the 2016 presidential campaign reaffirm the security concerns Russia poses. ### It’s hard not to feel like the sky is constantly falling thanks to the unpredictable and frequently incompetent nature of the Trump administration. However, concerns about increasing European defense spending go back to Richard Nixon, who reached agreements with West Germany and other partners to help cover the cost of stationing troops in Europe. Similar stances with some variation have been taken by basically every administration since. ### Washington has long sought more spending from its NATO partners because U.S. military doctrine has required the U.S. to be able to fight multiple wars simultaneously ever since World War II. And the U.S. is itself capable of deploying large forces in case of multiple conflicts, providing a broad security umbrella or presence across much of the globe. ### In exchange for the ironclad guarantee that the full weight of the U.S. military is available should it be necessary, NATO allows the U.S. to station troops and assets in Europe in support of missions within Europe as well as in the Middle East and Africa. U.S. forces also provide a clear deterrent. If Russia or any other state were to invade a NATO member hosting U.S. troops, the U.S. would have to respond because they’d be in harm’s way. ### Past administrations have always assumed NATO to be a crucial component of U.S. security. Thanks to Washington’s outsized role in defense, partners can focus and specialize their capabilities — something that’s more important than arbitrary spending increases — so as to multiply the value of what they spend. Further, the alliance guarantees no European state undertakes a unilateral arms buildup to fight its neighbors. In short, NATO secures a peaceful Europe and helps the U.S. maintain security and project power elsewhere. ### Sadly, the Trump administration has repeatedly spurned multilateralism, preferring to negotiate one-on-one and treat NATO as if it were an extortion racket. Critiques about spending are fair, but NATO members have begun spending more relative to the U.S. since NATO’s Wales summit in 2014. And indeed, though many fear Trump’s lack of commitment to European defense, U.S. spending in Europe has risen too. ### Trump’s complaints about Germany’s subservience to Russia also have historical precedent. Back in 1982, the Reagan administration imposed sanctions on western firms’ participation in a proposed natural gas pipeline project from the Soviet Union to western Europe via western Germany. It was argued that allowing the Soviets to sell natural gas to allies would threaten security and undermine the alliance from within. European allies pushed back, forcing the U.S. to compromise . NATO wasn’t particularly threatened by that controversy then. ### President Donald Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin talk during a family photo session at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting on Nov. 11, 2017 in Da Nang, Vietnam.Jorge Silva / EPA file ### Today, Germany imports most of its natural gas from Russia . But it’s of limited value for Russian influence. After all, German chancellor Angela Merkel has led Europe in sanctioning Russia for its actions in Ukraine. And concerns about the proposed Nord Stream II pipeline — a pipeline running through the Baltic alluded to by Trump — are largely exaggerated. The pipeline changes relatively little for Europe’s energy security and Russia isn’t the Soviet Union. ### The real concern is what happens to Ukraine, which collects revenues from Russia’s shipments of gas via its pipelines. Trump’s opposition to Germany’s participation in Nord Stream II fits with traditional U.S. policy, whether or not he’s serious about his more outlandish criticisms. That should ease fears that he will make concessions about Ukraine for Russia’s benefit but confirm he’s willing to shred diplomatic relationships with key U.S. allies for unclear gain. ### In the end, Trump’s incendiary comments about NATO are deeply rooted in traditional American policy concerns. Where he differs is the packaging and the incoherence of his administration. Escalating trade fights and abandoning the Iran deal has put the U.S. at odds with European partners. Blatant disrespect for them and their interests is a recipe for political isolation over time. Despite his nonsensical talk of a 4 percent of GDP spending target, NATO agreed to a $33 billion spending increase. ### With several years left in his first term, this president has already stretched old tropes in transatlantic relations to their limits through his disinterest in facts and lack of finesse. ### With several years left in his first term, this president has already stretched old tropes in transatlantic relations to their limits through his disinterest in facts and lack of finesse. Where previous administrations understood that they could achieve concessions and assurances through steady diplomacy, he’s made such diplomacy impossible. Subordinates handling talks run the continuous risk of being undercut by an uninformed tweet or the childish annoyance Trump displayed in Brussels. American credibility is constantly undermined as an unnecessary negotiating tactic. ### Technically, Trump could pull the U.S. out of NATO at any time. But his complaints are just farcical versions of long-standing U.S. concerns that appear tough. U.S. policy isn’t changing. In fact, NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said Georgia, a country Russia invaded in 2008, will become a member, affirming its Euro-Atlantic aspirations more strongly than in the past. NATO is set to build a new base in Romania, a blow to Russia’s interests, and also extended an offer of membership to Northern Macedonia. ### Trump is set to meet Putin on Monday in Helsinki and most people, understandably, are worried about what could happen. Fortunately, U.S. policy is unlikely to change very much since Trump doesn’t seem all that concerned with the nitty gritty of governance. At the end of the day, the U.S. still needs NATO just like NATO still needs the U.S. And whether Trump likes it or not, his own Justice Department’s announcement last week reinforces to both the American public and U.S. officials why it’s in the interests of all NATO allies to stay united in the face of potential threats, from Russia and from elsewhere. ### Nick Trickett is the editor-in-chief and associate scholar for the Foreign Policy Research Institute's BMB Russia, a daily news brief and blog covering Russia's politics and economy as well as post-Soviet states.

""We got a lot of killers. What, do you think our country's so innocent? Take a look at what we've done, too. We've made a lot of mistakes. . . . So, a lot of killers around, believe me."" ### There was strong and vocal pushback at the time from most elected Republicans. ### Recommended Video: ### Now Playing: ### Finland is getting ready for Monday's summit between presidents Trump and Putin,    But it's still not clear what's on the agenda.    Trump has said he wants to discuss nuclear weapons, but he's under pressure at home to raise Moscow's interference in the 2016 US election.    In an interview on Sunday, Trump downplayed the significance of the tete a tete.    ""Having meetings with Russia, China, North Korea, I believe in it. Nothing bad is going to come out of it, and maybe some good will come out. But I'm going with low expectations I'm not going with high expectations,"" Trump said during an interview with CBS News on Sunday (July 15).     French President Macron met with Putin on Sunday, on the sidelines of the World Cup final. The Kremlin said Macron would brief Putin on the recent NATO summit, where Trump stunned allies with his divisive rhetoric and his claim the meeting with Putin would be easier.    Demonstrators in Helsinki, meanwhile, are making their feelings very clear.   In all, some 16 protests against both Trump and Putin's are expected to take place in the Finnish capital on Sunday and Monday. ### Media: Euronews ### Over the past several days, as Trump again engaged in a spree of whataboutism and moral relativism ahead of today's summit in Helsinki with Putin, far fewer GOP lawmakers have called him out. ### Piers Morgan, the former CNN host and a one-time contestant on ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" interviewed Trump aboard Air Force One for the Daily Mail as he visited the United Kingdom. As the president discussed his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Morgan interrupted: ""He's a ruthless dictator."" ### ""Sure he is,"" Trump said. ""He's ruthless, but so are others. I mean, I could name plenty of others that we deal with that you don't say the same thing about. I mean plenty of the people that I deal with are pretty ruthless people."" ### Asked if Putin would be in that group, Trump replied: ""I can't tell you that. I assume he probably is. But I could name others also. Look, if we can get along with Russia, that's a good thing."" ### Then, in an interview that aired Sunday, CBS's Jeff Glor asked Trump at his golf course in Scotland to identify the ""biggest foe globally right now."" Trump named the European Union, which includes many of America's closest historic allies. ""Well, I think we have a lot of foes,"" the president said. ""I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now you wouldn't think of the European Union, but they're a foe. Russia is foe in certain respects. China is a foe economically . . . But that doesn't mean they are bad. It doesn't mean anything. It means that they are competitive."" ### Trump also continued his pattern of blaming the American victim, not the foreign attacker. The president attacked the Democratic National Committee for allowing itself to get hacked and Barack Obama for not more forcefully responding, rather than the Russian government for conducting the hacks. ""We had much better defenses. I've been told that by a number of people. We had much better defenses, so they couldn't,"" Trump said on CBS, referring to his campaign and the Republican National Committee. ""I think the DNC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing themselves to be hacked. They had bad defenses and they were able to be hacked."" ### Trump hasn't changed, but the Republican Party has. CNN's Jake Tapper asked Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Sunday how Trump should hold Putin accountable after a dozen Russian officials were indicted last week for orchestrating a massive hacking campaign to interfere with American democracy. Paul replied that it is unrealistic to hold Moscow accountable. ### ""They are going to interfere in our elections. We also do the same,"" said Paul, citing a study that he said shows the United States interfered in the elections of other countries 81 times during a 50-year period in the last century. ""So, we all do it. What we need to do is make sure our electoral process is protected."" ### Paul, who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, has always been a libertarian, but he often tried to downplay this side of his worldview when he sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Now that Trump is in control, he's talking much more like his father again. ### Even traditional hawks are now minimizing what the Russians did in 2016. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who chairs the Europe subcommittee on Foreign Relations, said after returning from a July Fourth visit to Moscow that Congress overreacted to Russia's interference in our elections. ""I've been pretty upfront that the election interference - as serious as that was and unacceptable - is not the greatest threat to our democracy,"" he told the conservative Washington Examiner. ""We've blown it way out of proportion - [as if it's] the greatest threat to democracy . . . We need to really honestly assess what actually happened, what effect did it have, and what effect are our sanctions actually having, positively and negatively."" ### Would he feel the same way if Russia interfered in his 2016 reelection campaign to help Russ Feingold, his Democratic opponent? ### ""Johnson's remarks to the Examiner were highlighted by Russian state media,"" Roll Call reported. ""The Russian news agency TASS reported on Johnson's comments, as did Sputnik International."" ### Pressed on his comments last week during an appearance on WOSH, an AM talk radio station in Oshkosh, Johnson doubled down on his position that the U.S. faces more serious threats than election hacking. ""It's very difficult to really meddle in our elections,"" the senator said. ""It just is. These are locally run. It's almost impossible to change the vote tally. My concern would be violating the voter files, but we have those issues anyway and there are plenty of controls on that. . . . From a standpoint of using social media, we spent a couple of billion dollars on the last election. They, maybe, spent a couple hundred thousand."" ### ""Most countries would meddle and play in our domestic elections if they could, and some of them have,""Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said recently. ""We have to be realistic [that] nations are going to do what is in their [national] interest. We've done a lot of things, too."" ### Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, made that comment to the Examiner as he prepared to lead a delegation of Senate Republicans on a CODEL to Russia. The group was in Moscow when the Senate Intelligence Committee published a bipartisan report that validated the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in 2016 election on the personal orders of Putin. ### ""I'm not here today to accuse Russia of this or that or so forth,"" Shelby told the speaker of the Duma in Moscow during the controversial trip. ### Shelby later sought to clarify that he was not saying Russia and the U.S. are the same, and that he is not excusing everything Moscow has done. ""I was just stating the reality of it,"" he told the Daily Beast. ### It's hard to be surprised anymore, but it is nonetheless surreal to read quotes from Republican senators that sound like they might have been uttered instead by Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn or Chalmers Johnson. Conservatives like Jeane Kirkpatrick hammered peacenik liberals for this sort of relativism during the Cold War. Republicans used to be the ones who not only espoused American exceptionalism but accused Democrats of acting like the United States was just another name on the United Nations roster, somewhere between Albania and Zimbabwe. ### As Ronald Reagan told the National Association of Evangelicals in 1983, ""I urge you to beware the temptation of . . . blithely declaring yourselves above it all and to label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire."" ### Trump, who took out full-page newspaper ads to attack Reagan's foreign policy during the 1980s (even as it was winning the Cold War), has remade the Republican Party in his image over the past three years. The president has shown a consistent impulse to blame ""both sides."" After the violence in Charlottesville last August, Trump said there are ""two sides to a story."" He attacked counterprotesters for acting ""very, very violently"" as they came ""with clubs in their hand"" at the neo-Nazis and KKK members who were protesting the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue. ""You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent, and nobody wants to say that,"" Trump said. ""Do they have any semblance of guilt? Do they have any problem? I think they do!"" ### To be sure, there are notable holdouts. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, battling brain cancer, put out a rare statement calling on Trump to cancel today's meeting - if he is ""not prepared to hold Putin accountable."" ### ""Putin is a murderer,"" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., tweeted Sunday night. ""He has ordered the assassinations of political adversaries and used outlawed chemical weapons to do it. He oversees Russian military units that shot down Malaysian flight 17 and murdered almost 300 civilians. . . . Putin is a crook and a liar. He has broken almost every agreement he has signed with the United States, including on Syria and Ukraine. He has become one of the world's richest men through embezzlement and stealing from his own people."" ### Paul's comments on the Sunday shows were deeply revealing. The senator was adamant that he was not engaging in moral equivalency, but he suggested multiple times that the Kremlin was reacting to U.S. policy. Among the supposed provocations: Hillary Clinton calling for free and fair elections in Russia when she was secretary of state. ""One of the reasons they really didn't like Hillary Clinton,"" he told Tapper on CNN, ""is they found her responsible for some of the activity by the U.S. in their elections under the Obama administration."" ### Explaining his decision to vote against a resolution expressing support for NATO last week, Paul reached back even further: ""The provocation of pushing NATO forward after . . . James Baker promised [Mikhail] Gorbachev in 1990 when Germany unified that we would not go, the West would not go, one inch beyond Germany, and yet, a couple years later, under the Clinton administration, we kept pushing, pushing, pushing. . . . From Russia's perspective, they see NATO expansion as a threat. . . . Part of their militarism and part of their nationalism problem may be inherent to the tides of the current century there, but it's also in reaction to policy from the West as well."" ### Most Popular ### 1"

""We have 90 percent of the nuclear and that is not a good thing, that's a bad thing and I hope we can do something about that,"" Trump said. ### In order to calm new fears of a budding arms race, Trump said he would discuss the reduction of nuclear weapons with Putin. ### ""If we can do something to substantially reduce them, I mean, ideally get rid of them, maybe that's a dream, but certainly it's a subject that I'll be bringing up with him,"" Trump said last week. ""The proliferation is a tremendous, I mean, to me, it's the biggest problem in the world, nuclear weapons, biggest problem in the world."" ### One option Trump may present to Putin is a new nuclear weapons agreement.

2867,theatlantic.com,2018-07-16T08:36:47-04:00,"8:08 AM ET ### Carlos Barria / Reuters ### On Monday, President Donald Trump begins a summit with Vladimir Putin, the brutal authoritarian who leads Russia, a country where political dissidents are murdered; journalists, minorities, and homosexuals are persecuted; neighbors live under the threat of military takeover, and multiple hackers with close ties to the Kremlin are under FBI indictment for interfering in America’s 2016 election. ### It is necessary to meet with such men. Yet to love truth or liberty or democracy or justice or human rights or mere decency is to disapprove of Putin. And Trump has lavished praise on his Russian counterpart for years—long before he was in office and the pretext of diplomacy could be invoked—even singling out his “strength over his country” and comparing his leadership favorably to then-President Barack Obama. ### The substance of Trump’s bygone words is so repugnant and morally degenerate that Americans should feel upset he is representing our country in bilateral talks. At best, the values implicit in Trump’s bygone statements are un-American—they explicitly value a foreign leader’s brutal, repressive strength more highly than the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness it has undermined. ### Because he has been similarly obsequious when talking about other murderous dictators , and because his personal life is so rife with senseless cruelty , I think his depraved personal values are sufficient to explain his disconcerting words. ### Other critics insist that the way he flatters Putin suggests something even darker when seen in the context of his suspicious business ties to Russians, his determination to hide the details of his finances, the closeness of his political associates ’s corrupt ties to Moscow, and Trump’s flagrant lies about those associates. With a publication as mainstream as New York titling a cover story , “Will Trump Be Meeting With His Counterpart—Or His Handler?” it is clear that the president is regarded by many of his countrymen as every bit the possibly traitorous usurper that Birther Trump kept implying his predecessor to be. ### Whatever the reason for Trump’s sycophantic relationship with Putin, this is a hugely consequential and embarrassing geopolitical moment for a very divided United States. And it ought to be a lesson for much of the anti-Trump establishment, including those who believe Trump is merely morally compromised and those who believe he is compromised by financial leverage, as yet revealed evidence of collusion with Russia, or some other kind of blackmail. ### The Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations, and many of the think-tanks and political organizations that allied with them, spent 25 years advocating for various expansions of presidential power, often based on the premise that some feature of the modern world required a muscular executive to get things done. ### Critics who worried that the Constitution’s separation of powers was being subverted in ways that would ultimately haunt the country were dismissed by establishment conservatives, centrists, and progressives. “The founders’ anxieties about executive tyranny have proven erroneous,” Eric Posner wrote during Obama’s second term. “The president is kept in check by elections, the party system, the press, popular opinion, courts, a political culture that is deeply suspicious of his motives, term limits, and the sheer vastness of the bureaucracy which he can only barely control. He does not always do the right thing, of course, but presidents generally govern from the middle of the political spectrum.” ### Because of those establishment elites and the myriad ways that they championed executive power at the expense of the legislature, whether with visions of pragmatic technocracy or “national greatness” or advancing “social justice,” Trump exercises far more control than he otherwise would over matters as diverse as war, foreign trade, international treaties, and military alliances. ### Perhaps Trump will prove all his critics wrong in this week’s summit. But if he undermines America’s values or interests in some way that is at odds with how most members of Congress and a majority of the public would’ve had things done, one lesson will hold regardless of whether his actions flowed from corrupted values or corruption—the lesson that a strong legislature offers greater protection against destabilizing anomalies. There is no way to eliminate the dangers that an unfit president poses. It is best not to elect one in the first place. ### Still, no House or Senate would pass a resolution praising Putin in the manner of Trump, or blurt out something that compromises the NATO alliance; and while an individual representative or senator could be compromised, a foreign intelligence service can more easily corrupt a president than a whole legislative majority. ### For those who think Trump unfit, wouldn’t it be nice if there were a few more subjects about which Putin would know that he does not exercise significant control? ### Many Trump-hating elites long assumed that America would never elect so unfit a president, and so dismissed all worries about what such a person could do in a room with a foreign adversary of whom they are bizarrely fond. That isn’t the only reason that Congress should reassert greater control over war, foreign trade, international treaties, and military alliances, and downgrade the president’s power in substance and in the eyes of foreign governments. ### But it is yet another reason to do so that most of the American establishment undervalued during its generation-long push for increasing the power of the presidency far beyond what the Constitution or the wisest of the Framers intended. ### Is Trump’s meeting with Putin, or the broader  phenomenon of his presidency, enough to cause anyone to revise their bygone view of executive power? As yet, I’ve read a lot more formerly influential people calling this moment “an emergency” for our democracy than grappling with their role in exacerbating it. ### We want to hear what you think.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018 ### The Kremlin said it did not expect much from the meeting but hoped it would be a ""first step"" to resolving a crisis in ties. ### ""Presidents Trump and Putin respect each other and they get along well,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""There is no clear agenda. It will be determined by the heads of state themselves as they go along."" ### Critics and Trump's own advisers have urged Trump to use the summit to press Putin hard about ""malign"" activities, from annexing Ukraine's Crimea peninsula to interfering in Western elections, to poisoning a spy in England, which Moscow denies. ### During a breakfast meeting with Finland's president before the meeting with Putin in the Finnish capital, Trump appeared upbeat. Asked what he would say to Putin, Trump said: ""We'll do just fine, thank you."" ### Trump and his wife Melania returned to their hotel after the breakfast and were expected to remain there for a few hours. ### Putin landed in Helsinki about 40 minutes behind schedule, and was expected to head directly to the summit. The two leaders will hold a one-on-one with only interpretors, followed by a working lunch accompanied by advisers. ### While Trump has been abroad since last week, the special prosecutor investigating allegations that Russia interfered to help him win the 2016 presidential election indicted 12 Russians on Friday for stealing Democratic Party documents. ### Trump's foes at home have been scathing about his apparent refusal to criticise Putin. His 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton tweeted: ""Great World Cup. Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?"" ### Russia denies interfering in the U.S. presidential election. The state RIA news agency quoted a Russian source as saying Moscow was ""ready to discuss, ready to undertake mutual obligations of non-intervention into internal matters"". ### Trump has said he will raise the election meddling but does not expect to get anywhere. He has repeatedly noted that Putin denies it, while also saying that it is alleged to have taken place before he became president. ### For Putin, that the summit is even happening despite Russia's semi-pariah status among some Americans and U.S. allies is a geopolitical win. ### The countries are expected to discuss the prospect of extending a nuclear disarmament treaty, and the war in Syria, where Russian-backed forces of President Bashar al-Assad have advanced in the south of the country in recent weeks despite a ceasefire brokered by Moscow and Washington under Trump. ### The summit caps a trip abroad during which Trump sternly criticised NATO allies for failing to spend enough on their militaries and embarrassed British Prime Minister Theresa May by saying she refused to take his advice about how to negotiate Britain's exit from the EU. He referred to the European Union itself as a ""foe"" in trade, and repeatedly criticised it. ### In some of the strongest words yet reflecting the unease of Washington's traditional allies, Germany's foreign minister said on Monday Europe could not rely on Trump. ### ""We can no longer completely rely on the White House,"" Heiko Maas told the Funke newspaper group. ""To maintain our partnership with the USA we must readjust it. The first clear consequence can only be that we need to align ourselves even more closely in Europe."" ### Trump has predicted he will be accused of being too soft on Putin no matter how the summit goes. ""If I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia...I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" he tweeted on Sunday. ### © 2018 Thomson/Reuters.

The arguments feed the Kremlin narrative that democracy is dangerous unless it is carefully ""managed."" ### Russian commentators and editorialists who consider the European Union hostile, troublesome or irrelevant welcomed Trump's criticism of longtime European allies as ""foes"" to the U.S. ### Russia's state-run Channel One said Trump's meetings in Britain and contentious appearance at the NATO summit last week were secondary to Monday's summit, saying: ""After all, he was just passing through Brussels and London on the way to Helsinki."" ### Konstantin Kosachev, head of the upper house of parliament's foreign affairs committee, wrote in Izvestia that Monday's talks come at a time when ""so-called 'peace-loving' Europe is afraid of peace talks between U.S. and Russia."" ### Russian media did have rather tempered expectations of how much Putin can concretely get from the summit, but hoped for progress on solutions for Syria and Mideast tensions. ### Heading into the summit, Trump denounced the American news media as the ""enemy of the people,"" despite constitutional protections for freedom of the press. ### The Russian media scene is a different beast. Under Putin, the government has assumed control or sway over most broadcasters and mainstream media and put pressure on critical reporting online. Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some outspoken Russian journalists. ### A protest sign for the summit posted on a Helsinki bus stop Monday read ""Unpleasant things will happen to Journalists who ask Putin questions."" ### Despite clear interest in Russia in Putin's meeting with Trump, the summit wasn't the No. 1 item on many Russian newscasts or websites Monday: That honor went to the World Cup, and Russia's own global image."

Thank you! https://t.co/NOUTroe8MV ### https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js ### Monday's meeting, which was being closely watched by rattled world capitals, was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump's presidential campaign. Undeterred, the American president was set to go face-to-face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### Trump, who has been trying to lower expectations about what the meeting will achieve, told reporters during a breakfast Monday morning with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompting a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a witch hunt. ### Trump arrives in Finland for closely watched Putin summit ### In his tweets, Trump continued to undermine the investigation, and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor. He claimed Obama ""was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it."" ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin's primary mission was simply to have the summit happen. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one-on-one in the Finnish presidential palace's opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will then take questions at a press conference before going their separate ways. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow's attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America's closest allies, as a ""foe."" ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump's jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over ""delinquent"" defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### ""NATO is now strong & rich!"" Trump wrote in a celebratory tweet Monday morning. During his breakfast, he said NATO had ""never been more together"" and said the summit had been ""a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love."" ### Ahead of his sit-down with with Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump has continued to unleash a series of attacks on the media, including as Air Force One descended into Helsinki. ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" Trump tweeted. ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!"" ### ""Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, ""not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime."" ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week — another chaotic stop on his European tour — that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said ""certainly I'll be asking about it"" although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can't force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a ""shameful comedy"" staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn't contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria's border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia's carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level. ### Related stories"

3106,washingtonpost.com,2018-07-16T09:45:14-04:00,"Politics Analysis ### Analysis Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events ### Trump’s conflicting, evolving explanations of why he’s meeting with Vladimir Putin ### by Philip Bump July 16 at 9:04 AM Email the author ### It’s safe to say that President Trump’s weekend may not have been dominated by intense prep work for his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On both Saturday and Sunday , he played played a round of golf at his company’s course in Turnberry, Scotland. Shortly before the summit began, Trump also copped to watching Sunday’s World Cup final, hosted in Putin’s home country. That’s somewhere in the vicinity of 10 hours of downtime, shortly before one of the more important bilateral meetings of his presidency. ### But, then, Trump has fostered the idea that he was going to play this one by ear. In an interview with CBS News on Sunday, he said that he was going “in with low expectations.” His approach seemed to be something like: A meeting for a meeting’s sake. ### “I think it’s a good thing to meet. I do believe in meetings. I believe that having a meeting with Chairman Kim [Jong Un of North Korea] was a good thing,” Trump said. “Nothing bad is going to come out of it, and maybe some good will come out.” ### When the summit was first announced, national security adviser John Bolton indicated that there were no planned outcomes for it. Asked that day what he expected, Trump was vague . ### “Well, I think we’ll be talking about Syria. I think we’ll be talking about Ukraine,” he said. “I think we’ll be talking about many other subjects. And we’ll see what happens. So you never know.” ### He expanded that outward a bit during a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May last week. ### “We’ll be talking to President Putin about a number of things: Ukraine. We’ll be talking about Syria. We’ll be talking about other parts of the Middle East. I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,” he said, then explaining how both the United States and Russia had flirted with improving their arsenals. ### As the summit began on Monday, Trump revised the list again. “We have discussions on everything from trade to military to missiles to nuclear to China,” he said in opening remarks, seated next to Putin. ### Missing, you’ll notice, is any discussion of Russian interference in the 2016 election or the poisoning of a former Russian intelligence officer in Britain earlier this year, an attack blamed on Putin’s government. (A British woman died earlier this month after apparently handling the same nerve agent used in that first attack.) ### CBS asked Trump if he would ask Putin to extradite the 12 intelligence officers identified by the Department of Justice last week for their alleged role in hacking the Democratic National Committee and the campaign of Hillary Clinton two years ago. ### “I hadn’t thought of that. But I certainly, I’ll be asking about it,” Trump said. “But again, this was during the Obama administration. They were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration.” ### When The Post’s Philip Rucker asked Trump last week if he would raise the interference at all, he brushed it off. ### “We will, of course, ask your favorite question about meddling,” he said, then adding: “You know, what am I going to do? He may deny it. I mean, it’s one of those things. All I can do is say, ‘Did you’ and ‘Don’t do it again.’ But he may deny it. You’ll be the first to know.” ### That assertion that Trump is powerless to hold Putin accountable on election interference raises an important question: How, then, does he plan to hold Putin accountable on Ukraine or Syria? ### Or does he? ### Much of the conversation between the two leaders will happen in the dark. Trump and Putin spoke for about an hour-and-a-half with no one in the room besides interpreters. CNN reported that there were three reasons given for that isolation: ### Trump wants “alone time to assess [Putin] better,” ### Trump didn’t want aides in the room who “who favor a hard line against Russia,” and ### Trump “didn’t want details of their conversation to leak.” ### Those last two in particular are remarkable and easy to frame in an alarming way: Trump wants to treat Putin with generosity and doesn’t want the specifics of what he said to leak out. ### The New Yorker reported earlier this month that some Middle Eastern leaders were pushing shortly before the election for a deal in which Trump lifted sanctions against Russia imposed following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 in exchange for a resolution of the civil war in Syria. Syria, the Middle East and Ukraine all in one subject of conversation — a conversation to which Russia hard-liners in his administration would likely object. ### If the Trump-Putin confab mirrors Trump’s conversation with North Korea’s Kim, the president will hail the major breakthroughs that resulted, even if those breakthroughs are hard to identify under objective scrutiny. ### Trump’s aim may be more modest. During a news conference last week, he offered another possible outcome of the summit: friendship. ### “I hope we get along well,” Trump said. “I think we get along well. But ultimately, he’s a competitor. He’s representing Russia. I’m representing the United States. So, in a sense, we’re competitors. Not a question of friend or enemy. He’s not my enemy. And, hopefully, someday, maybe he’ll be a friend. But I just don’t know him very well. I’ve met him a couple of times.” ### This has been Trump’s refrain over and over, though generally less personally. Wouldn’t it be great if the United States and Russia got along? he’s asked repeatedly since the campaign. What if the president, rather than doing things like criticizing foreign leaders who allegedly murder people in allies’ countries, who invade neighboring countries and who try to subvert American democracy, instead tried a little kindness? This, too, undercuts the idea that Trump will hold Putin’s feet to the fire on any of those issues, however much his advisers (and his party) might hope that he does so. ### We should have a sense of how friendly Trump and Putin have become in fairly short order. ### The story must be told. ### Your subscription supports journalism that matters."

That indictment includes the most detailed U.S. accusations yet that Moscow meddled in the election in favor of Trump. ### What's more, Trump has insisted the two leaders meet at the beginning of the summit without any aides present — stirring concerns that the former KGB officer will outflank his American counterpart. ### Trump: 'Certainly' will ask about election hack ### In an interview with CBS that aired on Sunday, Trump said he would ""certainly"" ask the Russians in Helsinki about the hacking before pivoting to the role his predecessor may have had in the matter. ### ""This was during the Obama administration,"" Trump said. ""They (Russians) were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration."" ### Trump said he had not considered asking Putin for the extradition of the indicted agents to the United States to face the charges against them. ### ""I hadn't thought of that,"" he said. ### Limits on both leaders ### While it remains to be seen what Trump and Putin will — or won't — agree to on Monday, one foreign policy expert noted that both parties are limited in making commitments to one another. ### ""A lot of the things they may want to agree to are not things that the United States or Russia can agree to on behalf of other people,"" Olga Oliker, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC. ### ""Donald Trump may want to pledge that the United States is going to stay out of Ukraine ... but you've got laws in place that Congress has passed and that Trump has signed,"" Oliker explained. ### She added that the Minsk Agreements, signed by Russia and European powers in 2014 and 2015, call for Russia to first change its course in Ukraine if it wants an end to economic sanctions. ### ""So, Trump can't unilaterally do this. Nor could he make a commitment on behalf of NATO not to enlarge (to include) Ukraine because there (are) a whole lot of members of that alliance that get a vote in all of this,"" Oliker said. ""To say nothing of the Ukrainians themselves, in that, they get a vote and Donald Trump can't speak for them."""

With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ""I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,"" Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### ""The fact that we're having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,"" said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. ""What is important here is that we start a discussion."" ### Trump has been drawn to the spectacle of the summit and has expressed an eagerness to recreate in Helsinki the media show of last month's Singapore summit when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Even as many NATO leaders made supportive noises this week, the Helsinki summit has raised fears in many global capitals that Trump will pull back from traditional Western alliances, allowing Putin to expand his sphere of influence. ### Back home, too, there is wariness on Capitol Hill, with a number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans urging Trump to cancel the summit in the wake of the explosive indictments. ### But Trump has vowed that he can handle Putin, whom he has taken to referring to as a ""competitor"" rather than an adversary. ### And Trump in recent days has outlined some of the items he'd like to discuss, including Ukraine. Though the president has said he was ""not happy"" about Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, he puts the blame on his predecessor and says he will continue relations with Putin even if Moscow refuses to return the peninsula. ### Trump also said he and Putin would discuss the ongoing war in Syria and arms control, negotiations that White House officials have signaled could be fruitful. ### ""I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,"" the president said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. ""We've been modernizing and fixing and buying. And it's just a devastating technology. And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it's a very, very bad policy."" ### But it is the matter of election meddling, including fears Russia could try to interfere in the midterm elections this fall, that could play a central role in the summit talks or loom even larger if not addressed. In neither of Trump's previous meetings with Putin — informal talks on the sidelines of summits last year in Germany and Vietnam — did the president publicly upbraid the Russian leader, prompting questions about whether he believed the former KGB officer's denials over his own intelligence agencies' assessments of meddling. ### Trump repeatedly has cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking of his Democratic rivals and disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise it with Putin even as he downplayed its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### WHAT PUTIN WANTS ### For Putin, sitting down with Trump offers a long-awaited chance to begin repairing relations with Washington after years of spiraling tensions. ### Putin wants the U.S. and its allies to lift sanctions, pull back NATO forces deployed near Russia's borders and restore business as usual with Moscow. In the longer run, he hopes to persuade the U.S. to acknowledge Moscow's influence over its former Soviet neighbors and, more broadly, recognize Russia as a global player whose interests must be taken into account. ### These are long-term goals, and Putin realizes that no significant progress will come from just one meeting. More than anything else, he sees Monday's summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### ""Russia-U.S. ties aren't just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. ""It's unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don't meet."" ### Moscow views Trump's criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump's election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament's upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won't engage in vague talk about ""illusory subjects,"" such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia's return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he's likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be ""pointless"" to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea's status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine's push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### ""Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,"" Lukyanov said. ""But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident."" ### ___"

3427,cbsnews.com,2018-07-15T09:51:28-04:00,"CBS News ### CBS News July 15, 2018, 9:21 AM ### The art of globe making ### In the era of Google Maps, a North London shop preserves an elegant anachronism, producing artisan globes by hand. ### CBS News ### Email ### The art of the globe is second nature by now for the man of the world Martha Teichner is about to drop in on (This story was originally broadcast October 8, 2017): ### Tell me this isn't exactly what you'd imagine the workshop of some crazy, Victorian genius would look like. ### In the era of Google Maps, who makes a living smoothing wrinkles out of a continent, or coloring in the coast of Madagascar? ### CBS News ### Making globes by hand was pretty close to a lost art when Peter Bellerby decided to give his father one for his 80th birthday in 2008, and couldn't find any worth buying. ### ""So I kind of thought, I've got a few months to spare, I'll make a globe,"" he said. ### ""You thought it would be easy?"" asked Teichner. ### ""I thought it would be really easy."" ### Wrong! ### Two years later, he'd sold his house and his car to bankroll his globe-making. Meanwhile, his father's birthday came and went. ""More than one of them, yeah!"" Bellerby laughed. ### By the time he'd gotten one right, he'd spent $250,000 on it – and figured out he had the makings of a business. ### Peter Bellerby crafted a business making globes by hand. ### CBS News ### Bellerby had to improvise.  He had to crack the mystery of how exactly it was done in centuries past: ""There isn't a manual for globe-making. Mathematically I had my head around how it works relatively easily. That wasn't the struggle.  The thought of actually applying a piece of flat paper to a sphere, that was the struggle."" ### He always starts with Alaska as the first piece. Why? ""We could realistically start in any position,"" he said. ""It just is nice, watching the world develop."" ### To work at Bellerby & Co. Globemakers in North London, patience is required. God is said to have created the world in six days. But at Bellerby's it takes at least six months even to learn how. ### It may take months to create a single globe. ### CBS News ### Teichner tried her hand at cutting a continent: ""If you've had too much coffee, this could be really, really disastrous,"" she said. ### ""Yeah.  You're doing a really good attempt there,"" said Bellerby, encouragingly. ### ""'Attempt,' that's the key word.  As I've just cut into Brazil.  Oops, I really messed up Paraguay!"" ### Then, the strip of paper is dipped into plain water and then stretched over the globe. ""Try pushing the paper in both directions,"" Bellerby instructed. ### ""Oh, it's hard.  It makes wrinkles.  And how do you get the wrinkles out?"" ### ""You don't make them in the first place."" ### Martha Teichner tries her hand. ### CBS News ### The company can make only around 600 globes a year, many on commission.  They're back-ordered for months.  Even the legs for stand-models are crafted by hand. ### So, a Bellerby globe is not cheap.  The smallest – soccer ball-sized – runs more than $1,300.  The biggest, the Churchill, 50 inches in diameter, is more than $80,000. The cost is a function of both its size and the labor required over the year and two months it takes to make it. ### Bellerby & Co.'s Churchill Globe. ### CBS News ### The Churchill was inspired by globes the same size that Gen. George Marshall had presented as Christmas presents to Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World Ear ii. ### Bellerby says he'll only ever make 40 Churchills. And when you spin it, it will keep spinning for two minutes all by itself. ### For a globemaker, the map can be tricky, whereby some countries must be given two names, such as Taiwan/Chinese Taipei. ### And then there are disputed borders, such as the Kashmir region: ""If I sell a globe in India, I can go to prison for six months if I mark it incorrectly,"" he said. ### Before he made globes, Peter Bellerby worked in television, ran a bowling alley and a nightclub, restored houses and an antique car.  He's begun working on a 1960 Bentley. ### ""The globes and [the Bentley]; what's the common denominator?"" asked Teichner. ### ""Obviously, I love amazing design."" ### So, whether it's cars or globes, Peter Bellerby has made the art of the elegant anachronism his life's work."

Trump is under increasing pressure to confront Putin directly about special counsel Robert Mueller's indictment of 12 Russians accused of conspiring to interfere in the 2016 election. ### Chris McGrath/Getty Images ### President Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin Monday, just days after an American grand jury indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers on charges related to Russia's interference in the 2016 election. ### The meeting, in Helsinki, Finland, is the first stand-alone summit between the two leaders. Trump told reporters he would raise the issue of Russia's role in the election, though he doesn't expect Putin to acknowledge any wrongdoing. ### ""I will absolutely bring that up,"" Trump said Friday, during a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. ""I don't think you'll have any, 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.' There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But I will absolutely, firmly ask the question."" ### Russian 'Reset 2.0': What Putin Wants From Trump At Helsinki Summit ### In the past, Putin has denied any Russian involvement in the U.S. presidential contest. And Trump has argued there's little to gain from pursuing the issue. ### ""What am I going to do?"" Trump asked. ""He may deny it. I mean, it's one of those things. All I can do is say, 'Did you?' and 'Don't do it again.'"" ### The indictments unveiled on Friday allege that agents from Russia's military intelligence service, GRU, hacked into email servers used by the Democratic National Committee, along with state election systems and other targets. Embarrassing information was then passed along to WikiLeaks, which made the emails public. ### Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he briefed Trump on the impending charges before the president left for Europe last week. ### Hacking indictments overshadow meeting ### In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS , Trump said it hadn't occurred to him to ask Putin to extradite the accused agents to U.S. authorities. ### ""I hadn't thought of that,"" he said. ""But I certainly — I'll be asking about it."" ### No Americans were charged with knowingly taking part in the hacking scheme, although that's a continuing subject of investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller. ### The Russia Investigations: 6 Key Insights From The Cyberspy Indictment ### Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia, often dismissing the special counsel's probe as a ""witch hunt."" Speaking to reporters on Friday, the president acknowledged that suspicion surrounding the ongoing investigation complicates his dealings with Putin. ### ""It makes it very hard to do something with Russia. Anything you do, it's always going to be, 'Oh, Russia. He loves Russia,'"" Trump said. ""I love the United States. But I love getting along with Russia, and China, and other countries."" ### Conciliatory with Russia, combative with NATO and EU ### Trump's conciliatory tone towards Putin is a stark contrast to his combative attitude at last week's NATO summit, highlighting once again the president's transactional approach to foreign policy. In his CBS interview over the weekend, Trump drew little distinction between western democracies that share history and values with the United States and authoritarian regimes in Moscow and Beijing. ### Trump Says He Sees The European Union As A 'Foe' Of U.S. ### ""I think we have a lot of foes. I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,"" Trump said. ""Russia is foe in certain respects. China is a foe economically, certainly they are a foe. But that doesn't mean they are bad. It doesn't mean anything. It means that they are competitive."" ### Once the indictments against Russian agents were made public last week, Democrats urged Trump to cancel the summit with Putin, or at least not to meet with the Russian leader with no aides present, as planned. ### ""Glad-handing with Vladimir Putin on the heels of these indictments would be an insult to our democracy,"" Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement . ### ""Russia attacked our democracy,"" added Sen. Mark Warner , D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""That's all the more reason why [Trump] must not meet one-on-one with Vladimir Putin, who, in the absence of U.S. experts or advisers will undoubtedly take full advantage of an ill-prepared President."" ### Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Ne., who is frequently critical of Trump, said Russia's election interference should not be a partisan issue. ### ""All patriotic Americans should understand that Putin is not America's friend, and he is not the President's buddy,"" Sasse said in a statement. ""We should stand united against Putin's past and planned future attacks against us."" ### National security adviser John Bolton anticipated this kind of criticism weeks ago when the Putin summit was announced. But he said Trump would not be deterred by what he called ""political noise."" ### U.S.-Russia Summits, From Gravely Serious To Absurdly Comical ### ""He judges, correctly in my view, that this bilateral summit between himself and President Putin is something he needs to do and will do, regardless of political criticism here at home,"" Bolton said during a news conference in Moscow last month. ### Arms control, Syria, Ukraine also on the agenda ### In addition to Russia's election interference, Trump said he wants to discuss arms control with Putin, as well as the ongoing fighting in Syria and Ukraine. ### ""I'm not going in with high expectations but we may come out with some very surprising things,"" Trump said during his U.K. news conference. ### Trump downplayed his ties to Putin, saying they've met only a few times. The two leaders held talks on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany last year, as well as the APEC summit in Da Nang, Vietnam. ### Russian Influence Campaign Sought To Exploit Americans' Trust In Local News ### ""He's representing Russia. I'm representing the United States. So in a sense, we're competitors,"" Trump told reporters after a meeting with NATO allies in Brussels last week. ""Not a question of friend or enemy. He's not my enemy. and hopefully, someday, maybe he'll be a friend."" ### Although U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia's interference in the 2016 election was intended to help Trump and hurt his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, Trump insisted he hasn't done Moscow's bidding as president. He pointed to his efforts to boost U.S. oil exports and increase military spending as measures that would not win any points with Putin. ### Trump also expelled dozens of Russian diplomats earlier this year in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in the U.K. And he agreed to supply Ukraine with lethal weapons , a step that former Pres. Obama had resisted. ### ""I guarantee whoever is in Russia, they're saying, 'Oh, gee. Do we wish that Trump was not the victor in that election,'"" Trump said. ""We have been far tougher on Russia than anybody."" ### At the same time, Trump has floated the idea of allowing Russia back into the G7 , making it the G8. Russia was kicked out of the group in 2014 in response to its illegal annexation of Crimea. ### Trump refused to say last week whether he was prepared to recognize Crimea as Russian territory, even though his national security adviser has said that's not the position of the United States. ### ""That's an interesting question,"" Trump said in Brussels. ""What will happen with Crimea from this point on? That I can't tell you. But I'm not happy about Crimea."" ### Trump also told reporters he is willing to discuss ending joint military exercises with the Baltic states if Putin asks. The president granted a similar concession to North Korea last month, halting U.S. military exercises with South Korea at the request of Kim Jong Un. ### ""You can't solve problems if you're not talking about them,"" said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia in a briefing before the Trump-Putin summit. ""The president hopes that a meeting can help reduce tensions and lead to constructive engagement that improves peace and security around the world."" ### At the same time, Huntsman cautioned the meeting might not produce any breakthrough agreements. ### ""The fact that we're having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,"" he said."

That Singapore summit became a mass media event complete with powerful presidential images. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) ### More ### HELSINKI (AP) -- A face-to-face sitdown with a long-feared foe. Endless media hype. Huge ratings. ### Although President Donald Trump has met with Russia's Vladimir Putin twice before, he is eager to recreate in Finland the heady experience that he had last month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore: a summit that became a mass media event complete with powerful presidential images. Ever the showman and insistent on establishing closer ties to Moscow, Trump overruled his advisers and demanded the rituals and pageantry of a formal summit. ### Trump had boasted to confidants about the number of cameras in Singapore, claiming it dwarfed coverage of the Oscars, according to a person familiar with his thinking but not authorized to discuss private conversations and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Though Trump originally expressed concern that Helsinki was not glamorous enough and favored hosting Putin at the White House, the president was reassured by aides that it would be an effective backdrop. And long believing in the power of personal connections, he has insisted to aides that it was essential to sit down with Putin to establish a rapport. ### ""He's been very nice to me the times I've met him. I've been nice to him. He's a competitor,"" Trump said of Putin last week in Brussels. ""You know, somebody was saying, 'Is he an enemy?' No, he's not my enemy. 'Is he a friend?' No, I don't know him well enough."" ### Drawing on his experience as a marketer and salesman, Trump has long been convinced that his mastery of powerful images has been essential to his political rise. The president has told advisers that the Singapore diplomacy made him look like a take-charge president. And it was not lost on him that his poll numbers received a temporary bump after the meeting. ### With the same attention to detail that he devoted to campaign ads, Trump masterminded many of the looks for his meeting with Kim, including the two leaders' dramatic initial greeting and handshake and, later, their one-on-one time. At one point, he startled the Secret Service by giving Kim an impromptu tour of some mighty American machinery — the presidential limousine known as ""The Beast."" ### Though the results from the North Korea summit are debatable, Trump has told confidants he believed it was a masterstroke, according to three outside advisers and White House officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. ### Always favoring bold gambits that would separate him from his predecessors, Trump believed that the historic meeting with Kim was potentially his ticket for a Nobel Peace Prize and would become an essential part of his legacy. While summits with Russian leaders are far more common, Trump believes a similar boost would occur if he can improve relations with Moscow and get Putin to make concessions never attained by President Barack Obama. ### ""I could say: 'Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Syria,'"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News last month. ""'Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Ukraine?'"" ### And while the imagery of Singapore made the idea of a Putin summit that much more tantalizing, Trump was already keen on setting up a one-on-one meeting, even with the risks entailed in meeting an experienced leader who is also a former KGB official. ### The president met with Putin on the sidelines of international summits last year — once in Germany, once in Vietnam — and both times he invited his Russian counterpart to the White House, according to three current and former administration officials. He reiterated the invitation on a call with Putin this spring and initially told aides that he wanted to have the meeting at the White House. ### He was later convinced to do it abroad, tacking the summit onto his planned visit to Belgium and Britain. Initially concerned that Helsinki was not a fitting location, Trump relented after being briefed on the history of U.S.-Russia summits in Finland and after seeing that it could be scheduled after a visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland, according to the three outside advisers and officials. ### But many in Washington are leery of the summit occurring anywhere, believing that just by agreeing to meet, Trump has offered further global legitimacy to Putin, who will preside over the World Cup final in Moscow the day before the summit. Aides have argued to Trump that the chances of substantive progress on a host of thorny issues, including Syria and Ukraine, are slim. ### Longtime American allies and White House aides alike have expressed concerns about the meeting. Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and the ongoing special counsel probe into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. There were calls from Capitol Hill for the president to cancel the summit after Friday's indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in an effort to help Trump. ### ""If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward,"" said Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. ### But the White House has insisted the meeting is on. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking and frequently derided special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise the election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said on Friday, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### ___"

Evan Vucci, File AP Photo ### Nuclear arms race is an expected topic for Trump-Putin talks ### By ROBERT BURNS AP National Security Writer ### July 14, 2018 04:22 PM ### WASHINGTON ### President Donald Trump seems of two minds on nuclear weapons. He muses about eliminating them but also has called for a U.S. buildup and bragged about his nuclear ""button."" ### In March, while forecasting a face-to-face meeting on this topic with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said in the same breath that an arms race was ""getting out of control"" and that he would never allow any country to have weapons ""even close to what we have,"" although Russia already does. ### How these seemingly competing instincts will play out in his talks Monday with Putin in Helsinki could profoundly affect the direction of U.S. defense policy. ### Before leaving a NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday, Trump was asked by a reporter whether he would raise long-standing U.S. allegations that Russia is violating a Cold War-era nuclear arms treaty, and whether he favors extending a separate treaty that he has criticized in the past as disadvantaging the U.S. ### SIGN UP ### Be the first to know. ### No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. ### SIGN ME UP! ### His one-word answer to the two-part question was ""yes"" — the first public indication that he wants to extend the New Start treaty, which expires in three years. Then on Friday, he vaguely spoke about how ""it would be a tremendous achievement if we could do something about nuclear proliferation."" ### Yet Trump's administration has shown little interest in negotiating further reductions in American and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. It has been more focused on formulating its own nuclear policy and on combating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. ### U.S.-Russian strategic nuclear weapons — those capable of striking each other's territory — are governed by New Start, which was negotiated by the Obama administration in 2010. It limits each country to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads. President Barack Obama favored further cuts, but U.S.-Russian relations soured after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea. ### The New Start deal is set to expire in February 2021 unless both sides agree to extend it. The Trump administration has been reviewing its position, so it's unclear whether Trump and Putin will do more than agree that their staffs should study the possibility of an extension. Private U.S. arms control advocates are urging an extension, in part because they see value in a treaty provision allowing each side to monitor what the other is doing on strategic weapons. ### Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, says Trump and Putin could instruct their aides to begin formal work on a five-year extension of the treaty, which would not require a renegotiation of its terms or ratification by the legislative branch of either government. ### ""If they don't extend New Start, there is a worrisome possibility that by 2021 there will be no legally binding limits on the world's two largest arsenals, and as a result, all of the difficult security challenges we have with the Russians will become even more difficult to manage,"" Kimball said. ### Analysts have puzzled over Trump's likely approach to an arms control discussion with Putin. The Russian leader said in May that his military would soon begin fielding a new generation of nuclear weapons, including a globe-circling ballistic missile that he previously said could fly over either the North or the South Pole to strike targets anywhere in the world with more powerful and more numerous warheads. Putin claimed it could evade any missile defense system. ### Putin also has promoted Russia's development of a nuclear-armed hypersonic vehicle that he said is more advanced than anything in the U.S. arsenal. Hypersonic flight equates to going Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. The U.S. is working on hypersonic missile technology but has said it fears falling behind Russia and China. ### Trump and Putin seem unlikely to get into this sort of detail, given that arms control would be just one of several topics raised, including the Syrian civil war. ### Even Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, seemed uncertain how Trump would address arms control issues in Helsinki, but he predicted they would discuss U.S. accusations that Russia is violating the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. ### That was the first superpower agreement to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched and cruise missiles with ranges of between 500 kilometers and 5,500 kilometers, or about 310 miles and 3,400 miles. Washington says Moscow is violating the treaty by testing and deploying a prohibited cruise missile. Russia strongly denies any violation and has in turn charged that some elements of Washington's missile defense system violate the treaty. ### Stephan Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, sees room for a Trump-Putin agreement on resolving these violation charges. ### ""You could have verification visits by the two sides to address that,"" he said, suggesting physical inspections of perhaps the Russian missile's fuel tank. That could help resolve the question of how far the missile can fly, while also protecting against disclosure of sensitive missile technology information. ### The list of U.S. complaints about Russian behavior in the nuclear realm has grown longer in recent years. This tension is captured in the Trump administration's updated nuclear policy, which points to Russian reliance on nuclear weapons as justification for deploying new types of U.S. nuclear weapons. ### It warned that Russian strategy on the potential coercive and military uses of nuclear weapons, ""increase the prospect for dangerous miscalculation and escalation."""

Trump laid out a list of topics for discussion that notably did not include Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. ### ""We have not been getting along well for the last number of years,"" Trump said as he and Putin sat down at the Presidential Palace in Finland's capital. ""But I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship. ... I really think the world wants to see us get along."" ### Putin, for his part, said he and Trump have maintained regular contact through phone calls and meetings at international events but ""the time has come to have a thorough discussion on various international problems and sensitive issues."" He added: ""There are quite a few of them for us to pay attention to."" ### Their opening one-on-one session ran well past the scheduled 90 minutes. ### SIGN UP ### Be the first to know. ### No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. ### SIGN ME UP! ### The summit, which is being closely watched around the world, was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump's presidential campaign. Trump said last week that he planned to again raise the meddling issue with Putin, but questions have been swirling about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the interference that prompted a special investigation probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."" ### Addressing reporters before the one-on-one meeting, Putin struck a casual pose during Trump's remarks, slouching in his chair with his legs wide and eyes low. He nodded along to some of Trump's remarks before they were translated, showcasing his fluency in English. Trump leaned forward in his chair, his hands tented in front of him and frequently glanced over at the Russian president. At one point, he shot Putin a wink. After Trump concluded his remarks, American reporters shouted several questions about whether he would bring up election meddling during his discussions with Putin. ### Trump did not respond; Putin appeared to smirk. ### With that, the leaders gave a quick handshake and their private meeting in the opulent Gothic Hall was under way. Just the two of them, each with a translator. ### They were to continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. They'll conclude the summit by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### On the streets, the summit attracted a grab-bag of protesters, with abortion-rights activists wearing artificially bulging bellies and Trump masks, anti-fascist protesters bearing signs with expletive-laden insults, and free traders, anti-war Ukrainians and gay rights supporters making their voices heard. ### The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States — and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea — for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow's aggression may go unchallenged. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming ""many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" ### The Russian foreign ministry responded, first by liking Trump's tweet and then replying: ""We agree."" ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian's leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British queen, among many others. ### Several dozen Trump supporters, many waving American flags and sporting ""Make America Great Again"" caps, cheered Trump near his waterfront hotel in Helsinki. Two held up a handwritten banner that read ""God Bless D & M Trump."" ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn't ""expect anything"" from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders met alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. Not mentioned: Election meddling or Syria. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a ""shameful comedy"" they claim has been staged to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties. ### In tweets Monday, Trump continued to undermine the investigation and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor. He claimed Obama ""was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it."" ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or the easing of crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow's attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria's border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia's carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### ___"

3793,theatlantic.com,2018-07-16T05:14:10-04:00,"Robert Malley ### 5:00 AM ET ### A damaged dome in the yard of an orthodox church damaged by shelling in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, in 2014.Antonio Bronic / Reuters ### UKRAINE—To land in Kiev is to reach ground zero of today’s confrontation between Russia and the West. The start of the Ukraine conflict is, depending on one’s chronology, the defining moment of their crisis. It’s here that, in the spring of 2014, Moscow organized a referendum of dubious legitimacy to annex Crimea; that Russia used troops whose existence it denied to help rebels seize parts of Donbas, in the country’s east; and that those rebels, who said they were acting on behalf of a public with whom they didn’t check, proclaimed the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics in that region. All this followed the ouster of Ukraine’s president in what the West called a revolution and Russia denounced as a coup. Today, Crimea remains firmly in Russian hands. The self-styled People’s Republics are largely cut off from the rest of the country by a line of contact that brings daily hardship, exchange of fire, and death to people on both sides. ### In a broader sense, the Ukraine conflict is a microcosm of what the West sees in Russia and Russia sees in the West. For Europe and the United States, it was typical Putin. Moscow’s intervention was driven by fear of so-called color revolutions—the popular uprisings that brought down numerous Russia-friendly governments in the former Soviet sphere—and its refusal to see those former Soviet republics drift toward Europe or NATO. It involved the use of raw, physical force (with echoes of Russia’s role in Georgia before Ukraine, and in Syria afterward); blatant violations of sovereignty and unilateral changes to international borders; reliance on armed proxies; and forms of hybrid warfare. The Kremlin justified its meddling by tarring opponents with broad brushes (opponents in Ukraine were portrayed as neo-Nazis much as those in Syria are painted as terrorists; in both cases characterizations true of only small minorities) or by obfuscating the Russian military’s role. ### Russia’s interpretation differs starkly, but arguably is no less heartfelt. It’s a narrative of repeated Western attempts at humiliation and encroachment on Moscow’s sphere of influence. Of demands that it conform to a Western vision of global security. Of promises betrayed, none more jarringly than what the Russians took to be a vow not to expand NATO eastward. Western outrage, indignation, and sanctions validate Putin’s faith in that narrative more than they shake it. They are taken as evidence of hypocrisy evinced by countries that invaded Iraq and Libya, armed sectarian rebels in Syria, flattened Mosul and Raqqa in the name of fighting terrorists, altered Europe’s post-war borders by recognizing Kosovo, and meddled in democratic elections as far back as the 1940s in Italy or as recently as 2000 in Serbia. For the West, the Ukraine incursions were a page out of Putin’s playbook. For Putin, they’re Russia’s payback. ### In its sustained gridlock, Ukraine’s crisis reflects the wider, presently unbridgeable Russian-Western divide. Kiev and Moscow in principle have endorsed the Minsk agreements, which remain the only legitimate framework for resolving the conflict. They provide for a ceasefire; local elections in Donetsk and Luhansk; a special, self-governing status for those regions; their reintegration into Ukraine; amnesty for the rebels; and withdrawal from the country of all foreign armed formations. But the parties’ purported acquiescence comes with heavy misgivings. Authorities in Kiev, along with a large number of Ukrainians, consider it a deal struck at gunpoint. Provisions on special status and pardon are especially hard to swallow. Russia for its part has evinced little interest in implementing the deal’s security provisions, in withdrawing troops it denies are even there or in allowing Ukraine to reinstate control over their common border. ### Adding to the sense of paralysis is the fact that Kiev is no more in a hurry to reintegrate Donbas citizens than Moscow is willing to assume responsibility for them. For the government of Ukraine and many in the west of the country, rebel-controlled territories are considered a repository of millions of hostile voters who could tip electoral outcomes toward politicians friendlier to Moscow. For the Kremlin, they could represent a financial burden they’d rather others handle.  A Ukrainian politician described the Donbas to me as a suitcase without a handle—something you can neither carry, nor rid yourself of. All of which makes it hard to escape the uncomfortable feeling that both sides are fighting over an agreement neither likes for the sake of territory inhabited by people neither wants. ### Finally, the outsized role President Donald Trump plays in Ukraine is a microcosm of the role he plays on the larger Russian-Western stage: an object of some hope, some fear, and considerable bemusement. He has blamed Russia’s Ukrainian land-grab on President Barack Obama’s weakness —thereby suggesting he would be stronger—while in the same breath expressing admiration for his Russian counterpart. He has earned gratitude among Moscow’s foes by providing Ukrainian government forces with offensive weapons , while throwing them into despair by hinting that Russia could legitimately hold on to Crimea . His recent attacks on the Nord Stream pipeline project (which could deal a devastating blow to Ukraine by providing Russia with an alternative route for its gas exports) provoke elation among some Ukrainians, while his simultaneous jibes at NATO fill them with angst. Many Ukrainians don’t know whether this White House will save or doom them. ### The impact of the conflict on ordinary citizens, meanwhile, is adding up. There are over 4 million people living in the conflict area of Donbas, experiencing food insecurity, unemployment, and lack of healthcare. On both sides of the frontline, roughly 600,000 live in unsafe settlements, exposed to daily shelling, land mines, and restrictions on freedom of movement as well as basic services. On both sides, civilians despair that a dividing line with no pre-existing cultural or political basis will fast become an almost irreversible fact of life. ### Authorities in Kiev are doing far too little in response. They could take steps to show that they consider residents of separatist-held areas full citizens—victims rather than perpetrators of the conflict. They could facilitate access across the line of contact and ensure that those who live in the separatist republics avoid bureaucratic hassle and can receive government benefits. Instead, Kiev restricts freedom of movement and access to state subsidies and services to residents of separatist-controlled territories. The Ukrainian government’s use of force is often indiscriminate, causing harm to unarmed civilians. It has failed to commit to amnesty even for people (teachers, doctors, and the like) who are mere employees on the wrong side of the line and are in need of reassurance about their future. Too often officials brush aside any criticism as mere echoes of Russian propaganda. ### Ukrainian leaders proffer their reasons: They do not wish to do anything that could provide a scintilla of legitimacy to separatist authorities or bankroll separatist rule. But neither the de facto authorities in the breakaway republics nor their sponsors in Moscow much care about how well or poorly residents fare. They hardly aspire to be models of good governance. It’s Ukraine’s own citizens who are made to pay the price. At this rate, if and when the time for reintegration comes, people on the eastern side of the line of separation are likely to view the return of Kiev’s writ to Donbas with more fear than relief. ### For now, such talk generally falls on deaf ears. Officials in Kiev argue that they did not provoke the conflict: They say it is a war not among Ukrainians but between Ukraine and a belligerent Russia. Its resolution, it follows, is out of their hands. Traveling across the country, one hears abundant theories about how the U.S., Russia, or the two together might end the conflict. For example, that Trump and Putin will strike a deal. That they will trade Syria for Ukraine or Crimea for the Donbas. That sooner or later, Russia will implode as did the Soviet Union before it, and the occupied territories will fall back into Ukraine’s lap. Or that Trump will flex his muscles, make Ukraine’s fate a priority, and get Putin to bend. ### Fine theories all, but with little if any basis in fact. Putin has neither will nor capacity to expel Iran from Syria (the presumed Russian quid for the U.S. lifting-of-Ukraine-sanctions quo). Trump’s possible intent and erratic statements notwithstanding, it’s hard to imagine an American president formally acquiescing in Russia’s annexation of Crimea in exchange for its withdrawal from Donbas. Russia has undeniable structural weaknesses, but is nowhere near the brink. That leaves Ukrainians with Trump. But a Trump who would care sufficiently about the future of Ukraine would be a different kind of Trump, and a different Trump is one thing he repeatedly has shown he cannot be. ### Ukrainian officials with whom I spoke are right that, for this crisis to be truly settled, fundamental issues that divide Moscow and the West will have to be addressed. But they are wrong if they think it will happen soon enough, that time is on their side, or that deep internal divisions in a nation lacking a strong sense of identity played no part. They can wait for Putin to crumble or for Trump to mutate. There are far wiser and safer bets than those, and bets over which they enjoy greater control: reaching out to people on the other side of the line, addressing the humanitarian situation in Donbas, and initiating an inclusive national dialogue on what a necessary future settlement might look like. ### We want to hear what you think.

The billboards were placed along the leaders’ route to the summit. ### Aside from the welcome billboard which reads “Mr. President, Welcome to the Land of Free Press,” most of the others feature headlines published in the newspaper over the years, according to a press release . ### “The headlines highlight the presidents’ turbulent relations with the media and were published between the years 2000 and 2018,” the statement said. ### Helsingin Sanomat ### Editor-in-chief Kaius Nieme also explained that the banners are intended as a display of support for “colleagues who have to fight in ever toughening circumstances on a daily basis both in the U.S. and Russia,” noting that both countries sit pretty far down on the 2018  World Press Freedom Index . Russia is ranked 148 and the U.S. sits at 45. Finland is ranked fourth. ### Helsingin Sanomat ### Trump marked his trip to Helsinki with a tweet claiming that, “Much of our news media is indeed the  enemy of the people .” ### Nothing to add. I tip my hat to you Helsingin Sanomat. #helsinginsanomat #finland #landoffreepress pic.twitter.com/GCslPooqUR ### — Juhku (@TheJuhku) July 16, 2018 ### Other activist groups are making their message heard across Helsinki as well. The Human Rights Campaign placed banners on Finland’s Presidential Palace on Sunday which target Putin for the treatment of Chechnya’s LGBTQ population, and Greenpeace placed two banners atop the city’s Kallio church calling on both leaders to “ Warm Our Hearts, Not Our Planet .” ### 3/Ahead of the Trump-Putin Summit, @HRC joined @bellvisuals to project a message onto the side of the Presidential Palace in Helsinki demanding that both leaders end the ongoing anti-LGBTQ crimes against humanity occurring in the Russian republic of Chechnya. #EyesOnChechnya pic.twitter.com/dldw5fRb3l ### — Human Rights Campaign (@HRC) July 16, 2018 ### Trump is on the last leg of his latest European trip, which took him first to Brussels for a NATO summit and then to the U.K. for a working visit. ### He said that his meeting with Putin “ might be the easiest of them all ” amid controversy over his handling of a NATO agreement on increased defense spending and trade talks with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May. ### He added on Sunday that he had low expectations for the meeting, but “ nothing bad is going to come out of it and maybe some good will come out.” ### RELATED..."

He hailed it as ""one of the best ever!"" ### Trump on Putin meeting: ""We'll do just fine"" ### Mr. Trump kicked off Monday's day of events by joining the President of the Republic of Finland and the first ladies at the Mäntyniemi Residence for an official welcome ceremony. ### Enjoying Finnish summer at the balcony of the Mäntyniemi residence: Mrs @JenniHaukio , @FLOTUS Melania Trump, @POTUS Donald Trump and President of Finland Sauli @Niinisto . #HELSINKI2018 pic.twitter.com/NPuzvGPWBC ### — TPKanslia (@TPKanslia) July 16, 2018 ### Later at a breakfast he thanked the president for hosting the historic summit and lauded the strength of the NATO alliance following his summit in Brussels. ### ""Well we think Finland's a great country.

The Russian witch hunt. The rigged situation,"" said Mr. Trump in an interview with Glor at the president's golf course in Turnberry, Scotland on Saturday. ### Ukraine, Crimea and sanctions ### Leading up to the meeting with Putin, Mr. Trump has also been asked about Crimea. In response, he has blamed President Obama for allowing Putin to annex Crimea from Ukraine during his administration in 2014. Putin, Mr. Trump said at a news conference with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May last week that Obama ""failed very badly with Crimea - I wouldn't have done that."" ""We'll have to see what happens,"" he added. ### At the time, Mr. Obama condemned the move, and the U.S. and E.U. sanctioned Russia afterward. Even now, only countries like Venezuela and Syria recognize Crimea as part of Russia. In May, Russia bolstered its relationship with Crimea with the completed construction of a bridge from Russia to Crimea. ### While Ukraine and some European allies fear that Mr. Trump will recognize the annexation of Crimea, National Security Adviser told ABC News' ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos,"" ""That is not the policy of the U.S."" The U.S. ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman was also asked about Crimea Sunday. ""I think it's highly unlikely that that will come up in their conversation,"" he told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" adding that there are ""so many other things to talk about."" ### And at this point, U.S. sanctions against Russia over the annexation still remain in place, many of them dating back to the Obama administration in 2014. Russia has also been sanctioned by the U.S. over election meddling and other cyber attacks like NotPetya , which the U.S. and U.K. believe the Russian military executed, and which cost billions in damage across Europe, Asia and the U.S. ### Syria and Iran ### A centerpiece of the Helsinki summit will be the future of Syria and a proposal to enlist Russia as a partner in ousting Iran from that battlefield. ### Recently, on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" National Security Adviser Ambassador John Bolton signaled to CBS News' Margaret Brennan that the U.S. has dropped its rhetorical opposition to dictator Bashar al Assad , who has held onto power in Syria through a mix of brutal tactics such as chemical weapon s, and the firepower of Russian and Iranian forces, including Hezbollah. ### ""I don't think Assad is the strategic issue. I think Iran is the strategic issue,"" Bolton said. As Brennan has reported, the Trump administration has accepted that Assad will remain in power for the immediate future and has decided to focus on convincing Putin to sever ties with his battlefield partner Iran. ### It's not clear that Russia has the leverage or ability to push out Iran, which has served as Assad's main patron through the war, now in its seventh year. The U.S. does have its own leverage through a limited military presence of about 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria to assist local forces in the fight against ISIS .  But Mr. Trump has said he doesn't want to keep those troops in Syria. ### There are concerns about brokering another deal with Russia on Syria, since Putin is already currently violating the 2017 agreement that he personally brokered with Trump to halt attacks inside a so-called de--escalation zone in southern Syria. ### Trump tweets on success ahead of meeting ### On Sunday before arriving in Helsinki, Mr. Trump tweeted that he looked forward to meeting with Putin but that no matter how successful it was, he predicted the news media would paint it as a failure. ### Heading to Helsinki, Finland - looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia... ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 15, 2018 ### ""No matter how well I do at the summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough -- that i should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition,"" he tweeted. ### Trump claims NATO members ""thanked"" him for Putin meeting ### Ahead of Monday's meeting, Mr. Trump told reporters in Brussels that allied nations have expressed ""the opposite of concern"" over his summit with Putin and in fact thanked him for arranging it. ### ""They actually and they'll probably come out with a little bit of an edict. They actually thanked me for meeting. They thanked me for doing it and they gave us their best wishes. We'll see what happens. It's just a loose meeting. It's not a big schedule. It's not going to take a long time. And we'll see where it leads but it could lead to something very productive,"" Mr. Trump remarked on Thursday. ### Congressional concerns ### Lawmakers have expressed serious concerns with the president's meeting since the announcement of the summit, particularly as it relates to the U.S. election system's integrity heading into the 2018 midterm elections. ### Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer warned in a joint statement last week that if Mr. Trump leaves the summit with Putin without ""ironclad assurances"" from Russia that they won't carry out similar attacks on the U.S. election system,  ""this meeting will not only be a failure - it will be a grave step backward for the future of the international order and global security."" ### ""The president needs to remember that, as Commander-in-Chief, his duty is to protect the American people from foreign threats, not to sell out our democracy to Putin,"" they added. ### Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, said that the summit was not a surprise as Mr. Trump has a ""disturbing affinity for authoritarian figures."" He added that the president should use the meeting to confront Putin on Russian interference in the U.S. elections but worries it will instead end up being a ""gift to the Kremlin."" ### Republican and frequent Trump critic Sen. John McCain cast doubt that the summit should even move forward in light of the new indictments. ### President Trump must be willing to confront #Putin from a position of strength & demonstrate there will be a price to pay for his ongoing aggression. If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the #HelsinkiSummit should not move forward. https://t.co/HRfmgKTk0e ### — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) July 13, 2018 ### McCain tweeted that Mr. Trump ""must be willing to confront Putin from a position of strength and demonstrate there will be a price to pay for his ongoing aggression."" He added, ""If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the #HelsinkiSummit should not move forward."" ### Fellow Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona echoed that sentiment, tweeting that the indictments reaffirm that ""election interference is not a question to be asked of Vladimir Putin, but a statement to be made to Vladimir Putin: You interfered in our elections."" ### Will Trump raise Russian meddling in 2016? ### All eyes are on Mr. Trump to see if he will press Putin on Russia's involvement in the 2016 presidential election. National Security Adviser John Bolton told reporters in Moscow late last month that he ""expects it will be a subject of conversation between the two presidents."" ### Mr. Trump confirmed to reporters in Brussels during the NATO summit that he would in fact be asking about meddling during their meeting. Asked what he would do if the Russians denied such meddling, Mr. Trump replied: ""He [Putin] may."" ### ""He may deny it. It's one of those things. All I can say is, did you? And don't do it again. But he may deny. You'll be the first to know, okay."" ### The Kremlin, however, has repeatedly reiterated its denial of any interference with the election. ""It was stated clearly by our side that the Russian state hasn't interfered with the U.S. domestic politics , moreover hasn't interfered in the 2016 election ,"" Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said at a press conference last month after the U.S. and Moscow laid groundwork for the Helsinki meeting. ### ""The Russian state has never interfered and has no intention of interfering in U.S. elections,"" insisted Putin's foreign affairs adviser again on Friday, hours before Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictment s. ### Asked about the possibility of extraditing the Russians indicted in the DOJ's charges, Mr. Trump told Glor on Saturday, ""I might."" ### What's on the schedule? ### A senior U.S. official told CBS New s that the two leaders will have extended one-on-one meeting, which has heightened concern among some U.S. officials regarding any concessions that may be made when the two are in the room together. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the Russian government-funded network RT that it was the U.S. that requested that the Trump-Putin meeting take place without aides in the room. ### According to top advisers of the president, Mr. Trump's private one-on-one meeting with Putin is scheduled to last about half-an-hour but could go even longer than that. Putin has met with three previous U.S. presidents before Mr. Trump, but never has there been a private session of this magnitude. ### Afterward, Putin and Mr. Trump are also expected to take part in an expanded bilateral meeting that includes their top advisers, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton. ### The two leaders will also be holding a joint press conference following their meetings. ### Russian aides also say that Putin and Mr. Trump may adopt a joint statement on international security issues, including ""improving bilateral relations, both in terms of joint actions in the international arena and in terms of ensuring international stability and security."""

This was mainly because the north European country took a neutral political stance during that period. ### Even after that, and as a member of the European Union, Finland kept its role as bridge-builder between the West and the East. It hosted two other summits, in 1992 and 1997 — the latter brought together Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin. The meetings addressed security and economic issues. ### “Both (presidents) know the host — (and) have good relationships with the Finnish president,” said Torstila, who served as an ambassador and as secretary of state during his 44 years at the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ### Dirck Halstead | The LIFE Images Collection | Getty Images ### US Pres. Bill Clinton (L) & Russian Pres.

Russian and Finland share a border of about 807.8 miles in length. ### “American diplomats often use Helsinki as a resting place on their way to Moscow to recover from jet lag,” Torstila said, adding that Ronald Reagan did just that in 1988. ### Geographically speaking, it also makes sense to meet in Finland, given that Trump will be in Europe for other meetings, including with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May , and that Putin will be nearby in Moscow. ### “Helsinki is only a good hour’s flight from Moscow, where Putin will be watching the final of the World Cup on Sunday,” Torstila said. ### “The international scenario isn’t in order… Hopefully, this meeting will help lighting up the horizon,” Torstila said, mentioning several conflicts such as the Syrian War. ### However, the Finnish role is somewhat limited. “We have the role of host, giving them the best conditions,” he said. “I am very happy we can provide this.”"

NATO has, I think, never been stronger. It was a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love. I appreciated your support,' Trump said. ### The president was referring to the recently concluded summit in Brussels, where he bashed Germany for an energy pipeline deal with Russia and berated member nations who fail to meet 2 per cent of GDP defense spending commitments, only to declare victory as he left town. ### Trump then flew to London where he undermined Prime Minister Theresa May's government by trashing her 'soft' Brexit plan. ### I CAN SEE RUSSIA FROM MY HOUSE! Jenni Haukio, wife of Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, U.S. First Lady Melania Trump, U.S. President Donald Trump and Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, from left, pose for a photographer of the balcony of Niinisto's official residence in Helsinki, Finland, Monday, July 16, 2018 prior to his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Finnish capital ### Jenni Haukio, wife of Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, talks to U.S. First Lady Melania Trump, on the balcony of Niinisto's official residence in Helsinki, Finland, Monday, July 16, 2018 prior to his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Finnish capital ### LETS TRY THIS AGAIN: President Donald Trump, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton and Robert Frank Pence Ambassador of the United States of America to the Republic of Finland participate in a breakfast with Finland's President Sauli Niinisto in Helsinki, Finland, July 16, 2018.

(Evan Vucci / AP) ### President Trump said he isn’t going into his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin with “high expectations.” Trump said he “hadn't thought” to ask Putin to extradite the indicted Russians accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential election. ### So, what exactly will the leader of the free world chat about with the Russian leader when they sit down Monday morning in Helsinki, Finland? Here’s a look at three unavoidable topics the entire world has a vested interest in: ### Advertisement ### ELECTION MEDDLING ### Trump, after a talk with Putin at last year’s G20 summit, assured the American people that Moscow did not intervene in the 2016 presidential election. ### This time, it won’t be so easy for Trump to take Putin’s denials at face value after a federal grand jury just indicted 12 Russian intelligence agents for a plot to hack Democratic committee officials and leak their email correspondence online. The conversation between the world leaders may get quite awkward once Trump, who originally “hadn’t thought” about asking Putin to extradite the agents, now said he “certainly” will. ### A handout picture released by the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) on July 11, 2016 shows Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during a meeting with members of his government, in the capital Damascus.

But the fact is, they built bridges to Crimea. They just opened a big bridge that was started years ago. They built, I think, a submarine port; substantially added billions of dollars,"" Trump said. ### When Russia’s military entered Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, the U.S. and several other nations launched a series of economic sanctions — most of which Putin continually protests and presents as evidence of an anti-Russia conspiracy. ### European allies are hoping Trump can pressure Putin into some kind of agreement for those sanctions to remain in place unless Russia restores the region to Ukrainian control. ### Advertisement"

Niinisto also will hold a bilateral meeting with Putin. ### Finland, a Nordic nation of 5.5 million, has a long legacy of hosting U.S.-Soviet and U.S. Russian summits due to its geographic location and perceived neutrality. ### The last time a summit brought presidential entourages from Moscow and Washington to Helsinki was in March 1997, when U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin held talks on arms control and NATO expansion. ### In June, U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian military's General Staff, in a manor house owned by the Finnish state to exchange views on U.S.-Russia military relations, Syria and international security. ### Along with the presidents, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will meet at the Presidential Palace on Monday. ### Sari Autio-Sarasmo of the University of Helsinki's Aleksanteri Institute said the Finnish capital and Vienna, the capital of Austria, were important conduits between the East and the West during the Cold War. ### While both European cities were centers of espionage, Helsinki specialized in relaying information and acting as a go-between for world's two superpowers. ### ""As a member of the European Union, Finland doesn't anymore emphasize its neutrality, but strong expertise, particularly on Russia, and good location make Finland a very useful meeting place,"" said Autio-Sarasmo, who studies Cold War history. ### U.S. President Gerald Ford and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev met in Helsinki in 1975 to sign the landmark Helsinki Accords, a watershed commitment to peace, security and human rights. ### Finland joined the European Union in 1995, but has remained outside of NATO as a militarily non-aligned nation in a similar way as close Nordic neighbor Sweden. ### The 3,000-square-meter (32,292-square-foot) Presidential Palace, which underwent a major renovation completed in 2015, has hosted other prominent guests, including Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and the late (now a saint) Pope John Paul II. ### It was built for a wealthy Finnish merchant in the early 19th century on the grounds of a former salt store house. ### Finland was integrated into Russia's Czarist Empire as an independent Grand Duchy in 1809 after being part of the Kingdom of Sweden for nearly 700 years.

He was popular with Finns due to his policies sympathetic to Finland. ### During World War I, the grand residence temporarily housed a military hospital. Following Finland's independence from Russia in 1917, it was officially renamed the Presidential Palace in 1921. ### The palace now is the working residence of Finland's president.

4182,newyorker.com,2018-07-15T14:23:58-04:00,"By Susan B. Glasser ### 1:50 P.M. ### From the start of Donald Trump’s Presidency, the prospect of a summit with Putin like that in Helsinki on Monday has alarmed and worried many of America’s top Russia-watchers. ### Photograph by Brendan Smialowski / AFP / Getty ### On Monday, President Trump will become the fourth consecutive American President to hold a summit meeting with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Trump’s three predecessors each found Putin a challenge, starting out with high hopes only to have their dealings end in frustration and mutual recriminations. Will Trump fare differently? ### This President is betting on it. He personally insisted on the risky summit, despite advisers’ cautions and the long shadow of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election on his behalf. Beyond meeting Putin, it’s unclear what Trump hopes to establish in Helsinki, and the two sides have not agreed on any of the “deliverables” that are traditionally negotiated in advance of such a session. “The President has determined that now is the time for direct communication between himself and President Putin,” Trump’s Ambassador to Moscow, Jon Huntsman, told reporters before the trip. “And that’s the way he’s proceeding.” ### From the start of Trump’s Presidency, the prospect of such a meeting has alarmed and worried many of America’s top Russia-watchers, especially given Putin’s long record, over nearly two decades, of first raising, then dashing, the hopes of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama—hopes that personal encounters might produce a stable and new long-term foundation for the two former Cold War adversaries. In the end, they all ended up in what a longtime senior U.S. official, who advised all three Presidents, told me were “honorable failures.” In fact, it was in an angry, private conversation on the sidelines of a world-leader summit in September, 2016, in China, that Obama warned Putin to knock off the election hacking. ### So what will be the outcome of this summit that has no agenda and is of Trump’s making, amid a renewed hue and cry over Moscow’s 2016 U.S. election interference? I asked an array of Washington’s top Russia hands, who have advised every American President since Ronald Reagan on superpower summitry, what to expect. Many of the sixteen former senior U.S. officials I consulted—who included a former national-security adviser, four former U.S. Ambassadors to Russia, and two former Deputy Secretaries of State—have sat in the room with Putin and his American interlocutors during the past eighteen years, and they are well aware of the formidable combination of extensive preparation and historical grievance that Putin brings to the bargaining table. ### Trump, of course, is famous for not caring much about the expertise of the government he now heads. Had he consulted with those who have made it their job to understand Russia during the past several decades, here’s some of what he would have heard. ### 1. What are the best and worst potential outcomes of the Helsinki summit? ### Best Outcome ### “We need to think in terms of best possible outcome, because the best outcome is not available—meaning Trump will not press him on meddling in ours and other elections. Having Putin understand that we can use cyber to expose things he does not want exposed if Russia persists is not in the cards. Neither is the grand bargain on Crimea and Ukraine for Russia containing Iran in Syria. Leaving aside the morality of such a bargain, it is also not in the cards. Putin has his own version of the Brezhnev Doctrine: what is his or can be used to lever others (e.g., frozen conflicts) is irreversible and he is not going to trade what he already has.”—Dennis Ross, a top State Department official for George H. W. Bush during the collapse of the Soviet Union ### “Trump’s closest advisers (especially national-security adviser John Bolton) can rein him in from trying to buddy-buddy stuff with Putin. Also, keep him from even hinting that Crimea annexation is O.K. and/or we’ll let bygones be bygones. And finally undo some of the damage he’s done at the G7 and NATO summits. That’s for what Trump must not do. What he might do is scope out whether Putin might go for extension of New Start before it expires in 2021 (but remember: all Trump knows about New Start is that it’s an Obama thing and therefore poison). The treaty is heading for the ash heap of history—which could mean that arms control is kaput.”—Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State for Bill Clinton ### “The two leaders establish a working relationship, there is no blow-up or love-fest, there are no major concessions, and the two leaders agree on a few very modest steps to begin to restore relations between the two countries (e.g. military-related confidence-building measures, commitment not to interfere in each other’s elections, a commitment from Putin to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Baltic States within their current borders).”—Stephen Hadley, the national-security adviser for George W. Bush ### “Best outcome is Hippocratic—do no more practical harm in indulging Putin and his aggressiveness. The danger is that Trump will fall prey to one of two illusions. First is that personal rapport can transform relationship. Second is that grand bargains are within reach. Putin, a trained professional, will play to his ego and his illusions.”—William Burns, the U.S. Ambassador to Russia under George W. Bush and the Deputy Secretary of State for Barack Obama ### “Nothing of significance is said or done.”—Sarah Mendelson, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Economic and Social Council under Obama, and a longtime Russia expert ### Worst Outcome ### ""Either a blow-up between the two leaders that further poisons the relationship between the two countries or major U.S. concessions on key substantive issues (e.g. Crimea, Syria, European security). I do not expect either.”—Stephen Hadley ### 2. Is there any historical parallel to this summit? ### “Like the Reykjavik summit in 1986 between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, this will be a come-as-you-are, rather free-wheeling session. Then, it was due to the short, ten-day interval between the summit’s announcement and happening. Now it’ll be due to the unwillingness, or inability, of the President to focus on anything for more than ten minutes.”—Kenneth Adelman, the chief arms-control negotiator for Ronald Reagan ### “Nope. It would be an insult to JFK to say that the Vienna summit with Nikita Khrushchev was anything like this. JFK committed a rookie error. Trump has a plan—if you can call it that—to reorient the U.S. to leaders that he has an affinity for and countries that he’d like ours to become.”—Strobe Talbott ### “Not that I can think of. Perhaps the Trump-Kim meeting, but even that one had more time for planning.”—Thomas Graham, a senior National Security Council official for Russia during the George W. Bush Administration ### “I’ve been involved with most US-Russian high-level encounters since VP Bush’s first meeting with Gorbachev in 1985. There is no historical precedent that I know of for such a potentially high-stakes US-Russia meeting to take place with so little advance preparation, and with such a dark cloud of suspicion and uncertainty hanging over it. We are really in uncharted waters here.”—John Beyrle, a career diplomat who served as a U.S. Ambassador to Russia for George W. Bush and Barack Obama ### “No. I cannot remember a US-Russian or US-Soviet summit at which the president of the United States was so eager to befriend a Kremlin ruler.”—Michael McFaul, a U.S. Ambassador to Russia for Barack Obama, and the author of the book “ From Cold War to Hot Peace: An American Ambassador in Putin's Russia ” ### 3. What words or phrase would you use to describe the current U.S. policy toward Russia? ### “Contradictory and incoherent.”—Kenneth Adelman ### “Confused and contradictory.”—Dennis Ross ### “Off track.”—Stephen Hadley ### “Untethered. Trump’s approach toward dealing with Russia and Putin, judging from his many public statements on the subject, is nothing short of daydreamish. And this puts him in stark opposition to a bipartisan majority in Congress, and at odds with members of his own cabinet and most knowledgeable advisers on Russia.”—John Beyrle ### “Schizophrenic.”—William Burns ### “ ‘Hot Peace!’ ”—Michael McFaul ### 4. Given the 2016 election interference, is there any innocent explanation for Trump’s predisposition toward Putin, unrelated to the election? ### “His adoration of ‘strong’ leaders, meaning brutal dictators or whatever stripe: right, left, or center.”—Kenneth Adelman ### “The innocent explanation to Trump’s approach to Putin is that he thinks that the deteriorated state of U.S./Russian relations is dangerous and that it would be in the interest of both countries to find areas of cooperation. He is not wrong on this.”—Stephen Hadley ### “The only innocent explanation is that he has wanted to build a Trump Tower in Moscow since 1987 and sees business opportunities there and that he admires strongmen who don't have to endure pesky journalists challenging them.”—Angela Stent, a national-intelligence officer for Russia during the George W. Bush Administration ### “Naivete.”—John Beyrle ### “The political equivalent of penis envy. Autocrat’s affection.”—Sarah Mendelson ### 5. What is the biggest thing Americans are getting wrong about Russia right now? ### “That it is a lower-middle class power, with an economy smaller than Italy’s and even less efficient, a rusted military with second-rate weaponry and probably lousy leadership, and an ideology of Russian nationalism which appeals solely to Russians who are nationalists. Russia is not a superpower, not even close, and should never be regarded in, or even near, our league.”—Kenneth Adelman ### “Too many people—including many who have no excuse—are not paying attention [to] the damage Trump is doing to the U.S., the West, and the liberal (there! I said it) rule-based order . . . . or, if they are, they don’t care enough to do something [about it].”—Strobe Talbott ### “That it’s all about money and personal survival. The charge that Russia is a kleptocracy, or a mafia gang, discounts the role national interest plays in the formulation and execution of foreign policy. It leads to the view that if we just hit them hard enough in their pocketbooks they will cave, a view that overlooks the deprivation a country is prepared to endure to defend vital national interests. Finally, it is a view that lacks historical context—Putin’s Russia is far from an anomaly in Russian history in its internal workings and foreign ambitions. Our challenge is not dealing simply with Putin; it is dealing with Russia in all its complexity.”—Thomas Graham ### “The Russians may have wanted Trump to win, but they have so far been disappointed that he has not delivered and they remain wary of him.”—Angela Stent ### “To assume that Putinism will last forever. After Stalin came deStalinization. After Brezhnev came perestroika. Why does everyone assume that after Putin comes more Putinism?”—Michael McFaul ### Susan B. "

They recall how some observers have raised fears of “a new Yalta where Trump and Putin would divide the world between them in spheres of influence.” ### By invoking Yalta, the authors refer to the 1945 meeting at which the leaders of the Soviet Union, the UK and the US decided on the political makeup of the world after defeating the Nazis in WWII. ### Despite being “worried”about Trump’s rhetoric towards Russia and its president, the Finnish journalists hope that during the upcoming talks “everyone will nevertheless understand that European matters can no longer be agreed-on over the heads of Europeans.” ### What is the likely outcome of the Trump-Putin meeting? (POLL) ### “The deterioration of US-Russian relations is not beneficial to anyone,”the letter concludes. ### Trump took flak at home and abroad for his willingness to meet Putin eye-to-eye and hold bilateral negotiations with him without preconditions. Some of the European politicians have been voicing concerns that Trump might be striking deals with Moscow without consulting or notifying EU and NATO allies. ### During his recent trip to Britain, the US president called Putin “a competitor”and reiterated his longstanding view that it would be a “good thing”if the two nations could “get along.” ### *SOURCE: RT .

(Evan Vucci/AP) ### by Anton Troianovski and Philip Rucker July 15 at 11:55 AM Email the author ### HELSINKI — He allegedly helped him get elected. He has charmed him and egged him on. And on Monday, when Russian President Vladimir Putin meets President Trump face to face here in Finland’s capital, he will see what he gets out of it. ### Coming into Monday’s one-on-one summit, Trump faces intense pressure back home to confront Putin over Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, especially in the wake of Friday’s indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers for hacking and releasing Democratic emails. ### In Washington and throughout the West, leaders are also pressing Trump to hold firm in countering Putin’s intervention in Syria and Ukraine by refusing to recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea. ### But Trump’s week-long tour through Europe only served to underscore his common ground with Putin more than their differences. In Belgium and in the United Kingdom, Trump echoed Putin’s ideological worldview and his political posture — from decrying immigration patterns that he said were destroying European culture to assaulting the media as “fake news” and blaming the U.S. “deep state” and a “rigged witch hunt” investigation for the poor condition of U.S.-Russian relations. ### And Trump’s recent moves to disrupt America’s traditional alliances, both with trade disputes and rhetorical broadsides, enhances Russia’s position as Putin seeks to expand Moscow’s influence around the world. ### Trump was set to land in Helsinki Sunday night with what he said were low expectations and an unusually loose agenda for the kind of high-stakes international meeting that typically is tightly scripted with predetermined outcomes. ### People attend the “Helsinki Calling” protest in Helsinki on July 15, 2018, a day ahead of the meeting between the President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Ints Kalnins/Reuters) ### But Trump has an uncommon faith in his abilities to wing it on the global stage. When he departed Washington, Trump said meeting with Putin may be “the easiest” part of his trip. And as in last month’s Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, he is banking on his personality to forge a lasting bond with Putin that could improve U.S.-Russia relations and solve some of the world’s intractable problems. ### “He’s been very nice to me the times I’ve met him,” Trump told reporters last week in Brussels, previewing his Putin tête-à-tête. “I’ve been nice to him. He’s a competitor . . . He’s not my enemy. And hopefully, someday, maybe he’ll be a friend. It could happen.” ### In an indication of his friendly posture, Trump said he “hadn’t thought” of asking Putin to extradite the 12 Russian agents indicted by the U.S. Justice Department when prompted in an interview with CBS News anchor Jeff Glor. ### Trump went on to blame his predecessor for Russia’s election interference, telling Glor, “They were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration,” and adding that the Democratic National Committee “should be ashamed of themselves for allowing themselves to be hacked.” ### For the Kremlin, blaming Obama and the Washington establishment for the world’s ills has been one way to continue winning over Trump. ### Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, shakes hands with national security adviser John Bolton during their meeting in the Kremlin in Moscow on June 27, 2018. (Alexander Zemlianichenko/AFP/Getty Images) ### Ever since Trump’s surprise election victory, Putin has been echoing Trump’s claim that investigations into Russian election interference are sinister efforts to delegitimize and sabotage his presidency by Washington’s Democratic establishment and “deep state,” a reference to the intelligence and national-security apparatus. Both Trump and Putin have said the investigations are undermining U.S.-Russia relations and preventing progress on Syria and other problems. ### “We are well aware of the extent to which the American establishment is being held hostage to stereotypes and is under the heaviest domestic anti-Russian pressure,” Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week, according to Tass, a Russian state-controlled news agency. ### In Washington, Democratic leaders called on Trump to cancel the summit over last Friday’s indictments. While there is precedent — Obama nixed a Moscow meeting with Putin in 2013 in part because Russia granted asylum to Edward Snowden, who stands accused of illegally leaking U.S. intelligence secrets — Trump decided to keep the meeting. ### Trump has pledged to ask Putin whether Russia interfered in the election, though he said he assumes he will again deny it. ### U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russia is likely to try to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections, and both Democrats and Republicans have implored Trump to sternly warn him against doing so. ### “All patriotic Americans should understand that Putin is not America’s friend, and he is not the president’s buddy,” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement. ### Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who recently returned from a visit to Moscow, warned that “the Russians are very prepared to argue on so many issues that they’re not in the wrong.” ### On Monday, Putin is likely to try to win concessions by playing to Trump’s eagerness to one-up Obama and reject establishment thinking. ### “Trump is the ideal partner for a detente without concessions,” Alexander Baunov, a foreign-policy specialist at the independent Carnegie Moscow Center think tank, recently wrote. “He’s an enemy of the same America that is Russia’s adversary.” ### One Russian objective, for instance, has been to win a more accommodating approach from Trump on Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, which included the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Putin claims that the Obama Administration fomented the pro-Western revolution in Kiev that year in a bid to weaken Russian influence, and that Russia needed to take over Crimea to protect Russian speakers on the Black Sea peninsula. ### A top Putin ally in Russian parliament, Andrei Klimov, described Trump as a pragmatist with whom Moscow can work productively, in contrast to the “academic idealist” Obama who focused on “irrational matters” like promoting liberalism and democracy in places like Ukraine. ### “Trump is a different story,” Klimov said. “Ukraine was a project of Mr. Obama. The project didn’t pan out.” ### Trump has kept his options open regarding Crimea. Asked last week whether he intends to recognize Crimea as part of Russia when he meets with Putin, Trump blamed the situation on his predecessor. ### “That was on Barack Obama’s watch,” he told reporters. “That was not on Trump’s watch. Would I have allowed it to happen? No.” Trump added, “What will happen with Crimea from this point on? That I can’t tell you.” ### European leaders, still shellshocked from Trump’s ambush over defense spending at last week’s NATO meeting, said they fear Trump will legitimize Russia’s claim on Crimea. That would mean ending sanctions against Russia, blowing up the security response and giving a green light to the redrawing of international borders by force. ### “If [European leaders] feel that Trump has dissed them in Brussels and yet embraces Putin and is uncritical of Putin on Monday in Helsinki, that’s very bad optics,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a former ambassador to NATO and senior State Department official in the George W. Bush administration. ### At a dinner of NATO leaders last week in Brussels, Trump told fellow presidents and prime ministers that he would talk with Putin about Russia’s involvement in Syria and Ukraine, but went into little detail, according to one official with knowledge of the conversation. Leaders who had dealt with Putin previously recounted their own experiences, while careful not to make it sound as though they were instructing Trump on how to behave, the official said. ### Among Trump’s statements that clashed the most with the way America’s main European allies see the world were those on immigration. Standing alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May at her Chequers retreat last week, Trump used similar language to the white nationalist movement to denounce immigration as permanently altering cultures throughout Europe. ### “I think they better watch themselves because you are changing culture,” Trump said. “It’s a very sad situation.” ### May disagreed, but Trump would find kinship with Putin. The Russian president has described Europe’s immigration policy as “diluting traditional national values.” And Russian state media, like some conservative news outlets in the United States, have been aggressively highlighting security problems and cultural clashes arising from the migration of refugees to Western Europe from Syria and other war-torn places. ### Syria will be another top agenda item, officials on both sides have said. Putin has met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and with a top Iranian official in recent days, stoking speculation Putin and Trump could reach an agreement of some kind over the role that Iran, an ally of Russia, plays in Syria’s civil war. ### “Right now, there’s no trust in the relationship, and because of that, problem-solving is practically impossible,” U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “So this is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama, and quite frankly some of the danger, out of the relationship right now.” ### Monday’s summit is scheduled to start at 6 a.m. Washington time with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö welcoming Putin and Trump at Helsinki’s Presidential Palace, a neoclassical residence facing the Nordic capital’s heavily-touristed Baltic Sea waterfront. Trump and Putin will first meet one-on-one and then be joined by their top advisers for a working lunch. They will conclude their visit with a joint news conference — the first such joint news event between an American and Russian president since 2010. ### Russian officials say it was Trump who insisted holding a one-on-one meeting with Putin to start Monday’s talks. But some of them haven’t hid their anticipation that such a format will produce desired results. ### “When he’s not under pressure from his own administration, his own ministers, his own lawmakers, I believe Trump is able to talk to Russia far more constructively than we can all imagine,” lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Russia’s upper house of parliament, said in a radio interview. ### Within the U.S. foreign policy establishment, there is considerable concern that Trump is meeting with Putin without the presence of advisers or note-takers. Some Russia experts fear Trump is a relative novice and will be taken advantage of by Putin, a former KGB agent. ### “Putin is now meeting his fourth U.S. president,” said Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia. “He has been working on foreign affairs at the highest levels for two decades and at lower levels his whole life. He knows all the possible agenda items much better than Trump does. So why give the Russian side such an advantage?” ### Seung Min Kim in Helsinki and Michael Birnbaum in Brussels contributed to this report. ### The story must be told. ### Your subscription supports journalism that matters."

That indictment includes the most detailed U.S. accusations yet that Moscow meddled in the election in favor of Trump. ### What's more, Trump has insisted the two leaders meet at the beginning of the summit without any aides present — stirring concerns that the former KGB officer will outflank his American counterpart. ### Trump: 'Certainly' will ask about election hack ### In an interview with CBS that aired on Sunday, Trump said he would ""certainly"" ask the Russians in Helsinki about the hacking before pivoting to the role his predecessor may have had in the matter. ### ""This was during the Obama administration,"" Trump said.

4502,washingtontimes.com,2018-07-15T21:14:46-04:00,"Print ### By S.A. Miller and David Sherfinski -          The Washington Times -                         Sunday, July 15, 2018 ### President Trump walked into a meeting Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin expecting to get little or nothing out of high-stakes talks, while inviting criticism from Democrats and Republicans back home for his kid-glove treatment of the former KGB officer. ### Sitting down with Mr. Putin in Helsinki , Mr. Trump was armed with new evidence of Moscow’s hacking during 2016 U.S. presidential election campaigning. But he was refusing — at least in public — to use that knowledge to pressure the Russian president aggressively. ### “I go in with low expectations. I’m not going in with high expectations. I can’t tell you what’s going to happen,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with CBS News. ### His rock-bottom expectations built a bulwark against the inevitable onslaught of criticism from Mr. Trump ’s political rivals in Washington. But the low bar he set also underscored their complaints that he lacked a solid agenda for a one-on-one dialogue with a skilled and potentially dangerous opponent. ### Asked in the interview what his goal for the summit was, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll let you know after the meeting.” ### The president thinks the value of the summit is in dialing back the tension between the U.S. and Russia , avoiding conflicts and potentially finding areas of cooperation. ### He wants to improve relations between the U.S. and one of its chief adversaries, although Mr. Trump prefers the term “competitor.” ### The two presidents have met twice before, first on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Germany in July 2017 and then at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam in November. But they have never had a formal summit. ### The top issues for the Helsinki talks are Russia ’s meddling in elections in the U.S. and Europe, its annexation of Crimea, and the wars in Syria and Ukraine . ### They also are discussing agreements on nuclear weapons reductions and nonproliferation. ### Mr. Trump should have headed into the meeting in a strong position after a NATO summit in Brussels, where he succeeded in prodding allies to increase defense spending, and after a visit to the United Kingdom, where he strengthened that alliance. ### But the president stirred concerns about the summit at every stop. ### He suggested that he could recognize Russia ’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, which was condemned in a joint statement at the NATO summit just days earlier. ### Asked Friday about relenting to Russia on the status of Crimea, Mr. Trump said, “We’re going to see what happens” at the summit. ### Mr. Trump lumped in the European Union with Russia and China on a list of America’s foes around the world. ### “Now you wouldn’t think of the European Union, but they’re a foe. Russia is foe in certain respects. China is a foe economically, certainly they are a foe,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean they are bad. It doesn’t mean anything. It means that they are competitive. They want to do well, and we want to do well.” ### Although the president specified that the EU was a trading foe, the remark undercut his position as leader of the free world as he met with Mr. Putin . ### Mr. Trump consistently refused to call out Mr. Putin after 12 Russian military intelligence officers were indicted in the U.S. on charges of hacking related to the 2016 presidential election. The indictment came from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the election and accusation of Trump campaign collusion. ### The 12 officials work for the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), which is the Russian military’s foreign spy agency. It is unthinkable that the GRU would launch an attack on the U.S. election without the knowledge of Mr. Putin . ### Mr. Trump , who is still sensitive to Democrats’ attempts to delegitimize his election win by blaming it on Russian meddling and hacking, did not accuse Mr. Putin or publicly put him on the spot. Instead, the president claimed vindication because no Americans were indicted. ### He directed his criticism at what he calls “fake news” and at the Obama administration, which he slammed for allowing Russian spies to infiltrate the Democratic National Committee and Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign. ### “Why didn’t Obama do something about it? Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, that’s why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration, but Fake News doesn’t want to report the truth, as usual!” Mr. Trump tweeted. ### Top Democrats called on Mr. Trump , who was briefed on the indictments before they were publicly announced Friday, to cancel the meeting in light of the developments. ### Democrats and Republicans urged Mr. Trump to demand the extradition of the 12 intelligence officers. ### Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday to impress the importance of confronting Mr. Putin and refusing to relax U.S. sanctions on Russia . ### “For President Trump to meet with President Putin without expressing the outrage of the American people and securing real progress would be terrible for the United States and the security of our election system,” Mr. Schumer said. ### Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said he feared Mr. Trump would get played at a private meeting with Mr. Putin , where they would be accompanied only by interpreters. ### “ Vladimir Putin is a trained KGB agent. He may come in with maps of Syria or maps of Ukraine , and frankly I think he’ll take advantage of this president, who we know doesn’t do much prep work before these meetings,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” ### “We need other individuals from his administration in the room so we know at least someone will press the Russians on making sure they don’t interfere in future U.S. elections,” Mr. Warner said. ### Rep. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who heads the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he would advise Mr. Trump to put the extradition issue at the top of the agenda. ### “Your first request of Vladimir Putin needs to be, ‘Tell us which airport we can pick up the 25 Russians that tried to interfere with the fundamentals of our democracy,’” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” ### A previous indictment accused 13 Russians of using social media to sow divisions in the U.S. during the 2016 election season, but nothing came of that. ### Asked about extraditions in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump said he “hadn’t thought of that.” ### “I’ll be asking about it,” he said. “But again, this was during the Obama administration. They were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration.” ### John R. Bolton, the president’s national security adviser, said it would be “pretty silly” to ask Mr. Putin to extradite the Russian spies because the U.S. and Russia don’t have an extradition agreement. ### However, signaling that he expected the indictment to be part of the discussion in Helsinki , Mr. Bolton said it strengthened Mr. Trump ’s hand. ### “It shows that the justice system, the Department of Justice, are aware of these Russian efforts at election meddling, and I think the president can put this on the table and say, ‘This is a serious matter. We need to talk about it,’” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” ### Jon Huntsman, U.S. ambassador to Russia , downplayed Mr. Trump ’s remarks on Crimea, saying any change of policy was “highly unlikely.” ### “The agenda is the president’s. Everything will be his call. But I think it is highly unlikely that you’ll see any change in Crimea,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” ### Mr. Huntsman, who is in Helsinki for the bilateral meetings, insisted that Russia ’s takeover of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 is on the agenda. ### “This was a violation of international law. What we’ve seen in eastern Ukraine is a violation of international law,” he said, referring to Russia ’s involvement in ongoing fighting there. “We have some very real issues.” ### The ambassador didn’t know whether Mr. Trump would pressure Mr. Putin about extraditions. ### He also said the indictments were not surprising. ### “I don’t think the details are a surprise to folks who have followed this,” Mr. Huntsman said. “That now makes probably almost 30 Russians who have been rolled up by the Mueller indictment. That investigation continues. And I think the bigger picture is we need to hold the Russians accountable for what they did.”"

Trump laid out a list of topics for discussion that notably did not include Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. ### Mail icon ### ""We have not been getting along well for the last number of years,"" Trump said as he and Putin sat down at the Presidential Palace in Finland's capital. ""But I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship. ... I really think the world wants to see us get along."" ### Putin, for his part, said he and Trump have maintained regular contact by phone and meeting at international events but ""the time has come to have a thorough discussion on various international problems and sensitive issues."" He added, speaking through a translator: ""There are quite a few of them for us to pay attention to."" ### Putin struck a casual pose during Trump's remarks, slouching in his chair with his legs wide and eyes low. He nodded along to some of Trump's remarks before they were translated, showcasing his fluency in English. Trump leaned forward in his chair, his hands tented in front of him and frequently glancing over at his Russian counterpart. After Trump concluded his remarks, American reporters shouted several questions about whether he would bring up election meddling during his discussions with Putin. ### Trump did not respond; Putin appeared to smirk. ### With that, the two leaders gave a quick handshake and their private meeting in the opulent Gothic Hall was under way. Just the two of them, each with a translator. ### The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States - and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea - for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow's aggression may go unchallenged. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming ""many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" ### The summit, which was being closely monitored by rattled world capitals, was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump's presidential campaign. Undeterred, the American president was set to go face to face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian's leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British queen, among many others. ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn't ""expect anything"" from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. Not mentioned: Election meddling or Syria. ### Trump said last week that he would raise the election-meddling issue with Putin, but said he didn't expect Putin to budge on his denials. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### They'll continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."" ### ___ ### Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Ken Thomas and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report. ### ___"

That’s because talks between the U.S. and Russia could be viewed by Putin’s inner circle as evidence Washington is finally willing to recognize Moscow as a great power on the international stage. ### The Helsinki summit constitutes the final destination of an almost week-long European trip for Trump, during which he has frequently challenged traditional Western allies. ### Over the past week, Trump has sown doubts about America’s commitment to the NATO alliance, reportedly threatened to kill off a potential trade deal with the U.K. post-Brexit and described the EU as a “foe” of the world’s largest economy."
4559,washingtonpost.com,2018-07-16T01:14:38-04:00,"WorldViews Analysis ### Analysis Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events ### Trump can’t beat Putin at his own game ### by Amanda Erickson July 16 at 12:59 AM Email the author  Sign up for the Today's WorldView newsletter . ### Before last Thursday, President Trump's meeting in Helsinki with Russian President Vladimir Putin already promised to be interesting. Then special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's team indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers on charges of interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and things got even more complicated. ### Monday's summit is now an obvious opportunity for Trump to take his Russian counterpart to task, but it doesn't look like that will happen. On Saturday, Trump told reporters that he doesn't plan to take a hard line against Putin on election interference — or anything else. ### ""What am I going to do?""  Trump asked Thursday . ""He may deny it. All I can say is 'Did you?' and 'Don't do it again.' "" Over the weekend,  he told  ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Jeff Glor that he ""hadn't thought of"" asking Putin to take any kind of action against the men and women accused of tampering with American democracy, adding that he has ""low expectations"" for the meeting. ### It's yet another signal that Putin will be in the driver's seat when the two men hold meetings Monday. If Trump is trying to tamp down expectations, his Russian counterpart has already exceeded them. ### Russian President Vladimir Putin holds a glass during a ceremony receiving diplomatic credentials from foreign ambassadors at the Kremlin in Moscow. (Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters) ### Many analysts believe the mere existence of the summit is a victory for Russia, which is economically weakened and increasingly isolated. That Trump allegedly requested a one-on-one meeting with Putin — only translators will be present — only adds to that. As Masha Gessen put it in the New Yorker , Monday's events ""will be a demonstration of power for Putin. He needs to deliver nothing else."" ### But, she added, Putin may not have to struggle to get even more. Trump, for example, has seemed open to recognizing Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. If Putin can ""nudge Trump toward a verbal acknowledgment of the legitimacy of Russia’s interests in its old sphere of influence . . . Russians will perceive it as Putin restoring Russia's superpower status,"" Gessen wrote. If he were able to persuade Trump to agree to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria (another move  the president has already signaled he's open to ), it would be an even bigger coup for Russia. ### It's almost certain that Trump will be far less ready to fend off such tactics than Putin will be to use them. Former Putin adversaries  told the Guardian  over the weekend about the Russian president's penchant for extensive research and preparation ahead of major meetings with world leaders. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia who has met with Putin nearly a dozen times, issued a similar warning about Putin's knowledge of international issues. ""His theories are flawed; his prescriptions are dangerous. But he knows the details of these issues way better than Trump,""  McFaul wrote for The Washington Post  on Sunday. ### Putin, McFaul noted, is a masterful storyteller, able to spin compelling yarns that seduce listeners into following his advice. ""Putin will be waiting for concessions, rhetorical and substantive, from Trump to get our bilateral relationship on track. Putin, though, will never offer a real concession,"" McFaul explained. ""He rarely even engages in negotiation. The idea floated by Trump recently that Putin might do him a favor and get out of Ukraine or Syria is laughable. Putin does no one any favors. Geopolitics for him is a zero-sum game."" ### Putin is also not above a dirty trick: He once brought a dog to a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is notoriously canine-averse; in 2006, he seemingly tried to sabotage a NATO summit in Latvia by proposing to stop in for a birthday visit to then-French President Jacques Chirac. ### All of this, as former CIA officer John Sipher wrote in the Atlantic , suggests that Putin will have no trouble playing to Trump's weaknesses. ""He will fawn on Trump and play to his ignorance. He can easily appeal to Trump’s predilection to save money, antagonize allies, and disconnect from NATO obligations,"" Sipher wrote. ""This is not a meeting of equals but a summit between a con-man and a man who is easily conned. One orders his opponents killed; the other tweets at his."" ### Putin and Trump meet on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Hamburg last year. (Michael Klimentyev/Sputnik) ### But no matter what preparations Putin makes, the real danger is that Trump may be hungry for a result after his time in Helsinki. Mark Galeotti, a senior nonresident fellow at the Institute of International Relations Prague, noted that Trump fancies himself a master dealmaker, and he'll probably want to walk away with something that allows him to claim success. ### ""For Trump, with his trademark blend of arrogance and insecurity, and aware of the derision with which much of the U.S. and indeed global political classes regard him, the requirement is all the more pressing,"" Galeotti wrote for the Atlantic . ""This immediately gives Putin the advantage. Simply meeting with the U.S. president as an equal is a win for the head of a near-pariah nation with an economy smaller than the state of Michigan’s. He is ahead the moment he gets to shake Trump’s hand. And it helps him further that he knows Trump wants a deal, or at least the appearance of one."" ### The danger, as was the case when Trump met with North Korea's Kim Jong Un last month, is not that he makes no deal — it's that he makes a bad one. ""It is hard to see that Trump would be satisfied with the anodyne lowest common denominator of a joint communiqué making requisite noises about collaboration against terrorism, deconfliction in Syria, and maybe even talks about talks on arms control,"" Galeotti wrote. ""Putin, too, will no doubt push for more.""  Sign up for the Today's WorldView newsletter . ### Amanda Erickson Amanda Erickson writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

We’ll have to see. It just came onto the agenda last Friday. It’s something that’s brand new.” ### ""I don't think the details are a surprise to folks who have followed this,"" Huntsman added. ""That now makes probably almost 30 Russians who have been rolled up by the Mueller indictment. That investigation continues.

4619,zerohedge.com,2018-07-15T22:57:25-04:00,"Why the Media is Desperate to Reclaim its “Gatekeeper” Status for News ### by TDB - Jul 15, 2018 2:37 pm ### The good thing about fake news is that it is harder for people to fall for the government's propaganda. ### Jul 15, 2018 2:37 PM ### by Capitalist Exploits - Jul 15, 2018 2:39 pm ### Here's how to play it as an investor ### Jul 15, 2018 2:39 PM ### Authored by Federico Pieraccini via The Strategic Culture Foundation, ### The chaos that has engulfed the NATO summit is yet further confirmation of the world’s transition from a unipolar to a multipolar order, with the return of great-power competition and different states jockeying for hegemony. Trump is adapting to this environment by seeking to survive politically in a hostile environment. ### The meeting of the NATO countries in Brussels highlighted the apparent intentions of the US president towards his allies and the Atlantic organization. Trump's strategy is to oblige the European countries to halt energy imports from Moscow and replace them with liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US at a price that is obviously not cheap. The gas would come from the US by ship, entailing huge logistical costs that are not the case with regard to physical pipelines between Europe and Russia. This issue directly affects Germany and the Nord Stream II project, a deal worth billions of euros. ### The reasons behind Trump’s behavior are twofold. ### On the one hand, we have the politics of ""America First"", with the intention of increasing exports of LNG while boasting of “successes” to the base. ### The other purpose of Trump's words is to highlight, sotto voce, the inconsistency of EU countries, who despite considering Russia an existential danger, nevertheless strongly depend on Russia’s energy exports. ### To be fair to Trump, these same EU countries -- fearful of Moscow but ready to do business with it -- do not even spend 2% of their GDP on defense, while the US commits closer to 4%. For Trump this is surreal and intolerable. The NATO Summit began more or less with this anomaly, conveyed by Trump in front of the cameras to Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, with Pompeo and the US ambassador to NATO on either side of him doing their best to remain impassive. ### The photo-op with Merkel did not go any better. Needless to say, the American media is being driven into a tizzy. The headlines blare: ""Trump betrays the allies""; ""End of NATO"". CNN is in a state of mourning. Brzezinski's daughter (yes, that Brzezinski ) almost vomited from the tension on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. ### In truth, Trump is engaging in a lot of public relations. When he makes these performances in front of the cameras, he is speaking directly to his electoral base, showing that he is keeping his promises by putting “America First”. To be honest, it would be more appropriate to declare, ""America, b****h!"" ### To back his words up with actions, he slaps his allies with tariffs and sanctions against Russia, and now Iran, incurring huge losses for Europe. He mocks leaders like Merkel and Trudeau in public, and has humiliated Macron in front of the world. ### In practical terms, Trump does not care whether Germany buys LNG from the United States. If this is to ever occur, then it will take 20 years, given the cost and time needed to build dozens of LNG facilities on the European and American coasts. ### The summit between Trump and Putin in Helsinki could even lead to more drama if Trump wants to drive the media, liberals, neocons and his European allies into further conniptions. ### It depends on the issues on his checklist that he has to deal with before the November midterm elections. I do not rule out seeing Kim Jong-un in Washington before then, or a summit between the US, Israel and Palestine -- anything that will play to the desired optics. The issue is just that: all image, no substance. ### Trump is focussing principally on triumphing in the November midterms, and to do so he needs to look like a winner. He will be keen to ensure the moneybags of the Israel lobby and Saudi Arabia keep flowing. In doing so, he will probably even win the 2010 presidential election. There is always the possibility that the Fed and other financial conglomerates will decide to commit harakiri and blow up the economy with a new financial crisis in order to get rid of Trump. It would be the deserved end of the US empire. ### European politicians also await the midterms with great anticipation, hoping that this will be the end of the Trump nightmare. They still live in the same dreamworld of Hillary Clinton, believing that Democratic victory is possible and that Trump's election was simply an anomaly. ### They will not have woken from their nightmare when they come to realize that Trump has increased the number of Republicans in the House and Senate. Perhaps at that point, with sanctions in place against Russia and Iran and with huge economic losses and the prospect of another six years with Trump, a coin will drop for someone in Europe, and Trump will be seen as the catalyst for breaking ties with Washington and looking east towards a new set of alliances with China and Russia. ### In conclusion, we are experiencing the full effects of the Trump presidency, which is destructive of and devastating for the neoliberal world order. As I said at least a year before he was elected, Trump is accelerating the decline of the United States as a lodestar for the West, representing Washington’s swan song as the only superpower. ### It is not ""America First"", it is Trump First. There is no strategy or logic behind it. There are only friendships, his personal ego, and the need to remain in the saddle for another six years. Meanwhile, get your popcorn ready in anticipation of the Helsinki summit. ### Tags"

Press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (known by its French acronym RSF) dropped the United States down two places to 45 in its 2018 World Press Freedom Index rankings, saying Trump's presidency ""has fostered further decline in journalists' right to report."" ### ""He has declared the press an 'enemy of the American people' in a series of verbal attacks toward journalists, attempted to block White House access to multiple media outlets, and routinely uses the term 'fake news' in retaliation for critical reporting,"" RSF says. ### ""The violent anti-press rhetoric from the highest level of the US government has been coupled with an increase in the number of press freedom violations at the local level as journalists run the risk of arrest for covering protests or simply attempting to ask public officials questions."" ### Russia, for its part, comes in at 148 on the index. ### ""Between draconian laws and website blocking, the pressure on independent media has grown steadily since Vladimir Putin's return to the Kremlin in 2012. Leading independent news outlets have either been brought under control or throttled out of existence,"" RSF says. ### By contrast, Finland is ranked fourth, behind Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. ### Speaking to Jake Tapper in Helsinki about the billboards, CNN's Christiane Amanpour said the issue of press freedom was ""about truth and lies and it's about democracy and dictatorship."" ### ""Obviously [with] President Putin, you know there are scores of journalists in jail, there are political assassinations of opponents and journalists -- I mean, it's a whole different level,"" she said. ### She added that given the American laws specifically protecting the freedom of the press, ""it's a very troubling thing obviously to see [...] a constitutionally-guaranteed free and safe press to be under attack by their own leader."" ### Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

Undeterred, the American president was set to go face-to-face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### In an interview with CBS News, the president criticized the EU's trade practices and said he has ""very low expectations"" for his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### Trump, who has been trying to lower expectations about what the meeting will achieve, told reporters during a breakfast Monday morning with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompting a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a witch hunt. ### In his tweets, Trump continued to undermine the investigation, and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor. He claimed Obama ""was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it."" ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### Get the Breaking News newsletter! ### Get the latest breaking news as it happens. ### Sign up ### By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy . ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin's primary mission was simply to have the summit happen. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one-on-one in the Finnish presidential palace's opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will then take questions at a press conference before going their separate ways. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow's attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Opinion: Putin, Trump meeting won't mean much ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America's closest allies, as a ""foe."" ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump's jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over ""delinquent"" defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### ""NATO is now strong & rich!"" Trump wrote in a celebratory tweet Monday morning. During his breakfast, he said NATO had ""never been more together"" and said the summit had been ""a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love."" ### 12 Russians charged with 2016 election hacking The indictments were announced Friday by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as part of the ongoing special counsel probe into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.   (Credit: THE ASSOCIATED PRESS) ### Ahead of his sit-down with with Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump has continued to unleash a series of attacks on the media, including as Air Force One descended into Helsinki. ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" Trump tweeted. ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!"" ### ""Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, ""not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime."" ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump says in a television interview, ""Nothing bad is going to come out of it, and maybe some good will come out."" ### Trump said in Britain last week — another chaotic stop on his European tour — that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said ""certainly I'll be asking about it"" although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can't force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### SEE PHOTOS 13 moments that tell the story of Trump's first year ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a ""shameful comedy"" staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn't contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria's border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia's carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level. ### By The Associated Press"

4763,theatlantic.com,2018-07-16T05:14:10-04:00,"5:00 AM ET ### Reuters / Lehtikuva ### Donald Trump’s scolding of NATO allies, his digs at Britain’s prime minister and dismissal of investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election as a “rigged witch hunt” even though he knew Russian intelligence officers were about to be indicted back home for messing with American democracy—all right before meeting with Vladimir Putin in Finland—have revived a long-running narrative: The president of the United States, wittingly or unwittingly, is doing Russia’s bidding. ### “I’m not ready to say that our president is a Russian agent, but I have an agent, and he doesn’t do as much for me as Trump does for Russia,” the comedian Stephen Colbert joked . A more serious argument goes that Trump is undermining not just NATO but the whole post-World War II “Western order: our security relationships, our trade relationships, our special friendships with the U.K., Canada, Germany, and institutions like [the] EU, WTO, [and] UN,” as the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote . “This is Putin’s dream.” ### But if this is Putin’s dream, is it more of a nightmare? Whatever Trump’s intentions, U.S.-Russia relations are arguably at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. And many of Trump’s policies have intensified the confrontation. In Brussels this past week, for example, Trump did indeed place heavy strain on NATO, whose main mission is to deter and defend against Russia, by threatening that the United States will “go its own way” if the military alliance’s members don’t spend more on defense. But then those members reaffirmed their commitments to do just that while also continuing to encourage Russia’s neighbors Georgia and Ukraine to join NATO. The result of all the drama of the NATO summit, in other words, was at least in monetary terms a more-powerful military bloc that could soon extend its reach further along Russia’s borders—precisely what Putin has identified as “a direct threat to Russian security.” ### As Trump, who is engaged in his own nuclear-arms race with Putin, observed regarding the additional funds pledged by NATO members, “I don’t think that’s helping Russia.” In Brussels, Trump also laced into Germany for buying billions of dollars worth of gas from Russia and thus leaving itself vulnerable to Putin, while in Trump’s view not contributing sufficient military resources to NATO. Again, not exactly helpful to Russia. ### Yes, Trump has said and done all sorts of things that please Putin. He has refused to take seriously his own government’s findings about Russian meddling in America’s democratic process, though it’s impossible to separate this policy issue from the political reality that the probe into Russia’s actions casts a dark shadow on his presidential campaign and his very legitimacy as a leader. (In Britain on Friday, Trump promised to ask Putin yet again what he was up to in 2016, as if getting to the bottom of the most brazen foreign intervention in U.S. politics in recent memory was simply a matter of asking the Russian leader enough times whether he did it.) He has repeatedly praised the “strong” rule of Russia’s repressive leader, nearly never saying a bad word about him while taunting almost everyone else, and recently congratulated Putin on winning an unfree election even though his staff pleaded with him not to. He has called for Russia to be readmitted into the Group of Seven industrialized nations despite Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea—and declined to rule out recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. He has resisted implementing sanctions imposed on Russia over its election meddling and withdrawn U.S. aid to Syrian rebels while not stopping Russia from shoring up the rule of its ally Bashar al-Assad. ### More broadly, Trump has insisted that building “a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing” because the two countries can then work together to solve the world’s top challenges—like terrorism, nuclear proliferation, the nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea, and the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine—in spite of the fact that Russia and the United States frequently find themselves on opposing sides of these issues. This is what Putin would like too. As the scholar Fiona Hill, now Trump’s top Russia adviser, told me shortly after Trump’s election, the Russians want “the old sit-down like they had with FDR at Potsdam and Yalta , working out what’s their piece of real estate and what’s ours. They want to have the U.S. acknowledge that they’re a great power and have the right to have a veto over things that they don’t like.” ### But the Trump administration’s actions toward Russia have often been tougher than the president’s rhetoric. His administration has sanctioned Russian oligarchs and officials, approved the admittance of another country to NATO over the Kremlin’s protests, provided anti-tank missiles to Ukraine (something the Obama administration wouldn’t do), battled Russian mercenaries in Syria, and twice attacked Assad for using chemical weapons against civilians (the second time, Trump singled out Putin on Twitter for “backing Animal Assad”). It has shuttered Russian consulates and last spring booted 60 Russian officials from the country after the Russian government’s suspected poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter with a nerve agent in Britain, in a response coordinated with Western allies and billed as the “largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history.” ### Part of the explanation for Trump’s Jekyll-and-Hyde Russia policy is that the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election have restricted the president’s room for maneuver; even if he wants to be best friends with Putin, it’s proven politically difficult for him to do so. (“Anything you do, it’s always going to be ... ‘He loves Russia,’” Trump complained in Britain. “I love the United States.”) Another part is that members of Congress and the president’s top advisers tend to view Russia as an unambiguous U.S. adversary and have found various ways to pressure an unwilling Trump into taking a stronger stand against Putin. ### But the explanation isn’t complete without understanding that Trump simply doesn’t see the world the way most U.S. policymakers, including many in the highest echelons of his government, do. While American officials have traditionally thought of the nation’s national-security challenges in terms of great powers, rogue and failed states, and stateless terrorist groups that threaten not just the United States but the U.S.-led international system, Trump doesn’t adhere to these categories. As Colin Kahl, a former foreign-policy adviser to Joe Biden and Barack Obama, told me , Trump appears most alarmed by either direct dangers to the homeland or “all of these ways in which the dark side of globalization seeps across our borders” through terrorism, immigration, trade, and international interdependence more broadly. ### And while Russia does pose a direct danger to the United States through its election meddling (a sensitive subject that Trump tries to steer clear of) and nuclear arsenal (a threat the U.S. has managed to deter for decades), in Trump’s worldview it may not loom as large of a danger as, say, North Korea’s long-range nuclear missiles, China’s unfair trade practices, or even free-trade deals and military alliances with U.S. allies. Since the 1980s, Trump has seen “alliance security commitments and free trade as existential threats to U.S. interests,” Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution wrote ahead of the president’s trip to Europe. Since “he has never really been bothered about geopolitical stability,” he sees in Russia a country “that the U.S. has no security commitments to and no trade with. So no problem!” ### Hence why, according to The Washington Post , Trump initially resisted sending lethal arms to Ukraine and retaliating against Russia for the chemical attack against the former Russian spy. These were largely Europe’s problems, he reportedly asserted. When Trump’s aides failed to sell him on the argument that a Ukraine equipped with U.S. weapons could better fend off Russian aggression, the Post noted, they shifted to a more successful approach: Ukraine could become a regular purchaser of American military hardware. ### True to form, just before meeting Putin, Trump delivered a stunning assessment of America’s traditional allies and adversaries. Asked by CBS’s Jeff Glor who his “biggest foe globally” is, the American president’s first response was that “the European Union is a foe” because of “what they do to us in trade” by taking “advantage of us” and because “many of those countries are in NATO and they weren’t paying their bills.” Only then did he add that “Russia is foe in certain respects” and “China is a foe economically.” ### “But that doesn’t mean they are bad,” Trump added. “It means that they are competitive. They want to do well and we want to do well.” Trump claims that for the United States to do well, it has to get along less well with its longtime friends and better with at least one of its longtime foes. The summit in Finland, a moment dreamed up by the U.S. president, offers the clearest representation yet of what Donald Trump would do about Russia if nothing was standing in his way. ### We want to hear what you think.

Putin has previously told Trump Russia did not meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ### ""Certainly I'll be asking about it,"" Trump told CBS News on Saturday. ### While the election hacking issue was thrust into the spotlight on the eve of the summit, other issues awaited the leaders. ### Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman said Trump was ""highly unlikely"" to recognize Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea, but refused to rule out the possibility. ### Trump himself has been noncommittal on the issue, saying Friday during a press conference with British Prime Minister Teresa May that “we're going to see what happens"" at the Helsinki summit. ### The president claimed ahead of his summit with Putin that the Russian president would not have invaded Crimea had he been in office, calling the globally condemned annexation an “Obama disaster.” ### Putin has signaled he would like Trump to soften sanctions that Washington imposed over the annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, involvement in the Syrian civil war and allegations of Russian meddling. ### Trump signed an August, 2017 law imposing additional sanctions on Russia. The law bars Trump from easing many sanctions without Congress’ approval, but he can offer some relief without a nod from Congress. ### Almost 700 Russian people and companies are under U.S. sanctions. Individuals face limits on their travel and freezes on at least some of their assets, while some top Russian state banks and companies, including oil and gas giants, are effectively barred from getting financing through U.S. banks and markets. ### The two leaders also are expected to discuss a tentative deal to move Iranian troops farther from Israel's border with Syria and Jordan, in exchange for allowing access there to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. ### U.S. officials have worried about the danger of new conflict in Syria between Israel and Iran or Iran-backed forces. The White House also seeks increased Russian oil production—a move on which Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have already agreed—to restrict Iranian export earnings. ### A National Security Council official told Fox News that Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend to prepare for the Putin meeting. ### ""Yesterday I spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump,"" Netanyahu said in Israel on Sunday. ""We discussed security and diplomatic issues arising from regional developments, chief most among them, of course, Syria and Iran. ### ""I thanked President Trump for his tough policy against Iran because since this policy has been taken, we have seen a great effect on Iran and inside Iran,"" he added.

He’s been late for past meetings with the pope and British Queen, among many others. ### Trump, who has sought to lower expectations about what will be achieved, told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland’s president that he thought the summit would go “fine.” ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a “witch hunt.” ### In his tweets, Trump continued to undermine the investigation and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia’s efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump’s favor. He claimed Obama “was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it.” ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin’s primary mission was simply to have the summit happen. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one on one in the Finnish presidential palace’s opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor’s throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow’s attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America’s closest allies, as a “foe.” ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump’s jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over “delinquent” defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### “NATO is now strong & rich!” Trump wrote in a celebratory tweet Monday morning. During his breakfast, he said NATO had “never been more together” and said the summit had been “a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love.” ### Ahead of his sit-down with with Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump has continued to unleash a series of attacks on the media, including as Air Force One descended into Helsinki. ### “Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” Trump tweeted. “Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!” ### “Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,” said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, “not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime.” ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week – another chaotic stop on his European tour – that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,’” said Trump, invoking a television detective. “There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question.” ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said “certainly I’ll be asking about it” although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn’t have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can’t force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia’s constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week’s indictment as part of a “shameful comedy” staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn’t contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria’s border with Israel – a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia’s carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level. ### CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE ### Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Add your two cents. ### Authored by Paul Craig Roberts, ### Trump Should Fire Rosenstein Immediately ### Does Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officers for allegedly hacking Hillary’s emails and interfering in the US election have any purpose other than to throw a monkey wrench in President Trump’s upcoming summit with Putin? ### Don’t forget that Rosenstein is implicated in the orchestration of Russiagate as a weapon against Trump, a weapon that serves the interests of the Democratic Party and the military/security complex about which President Eisenhower warned us 56 years ago to no avail. Rosenstein’s indictment of 12 Russians for allegedly hacking computers is a political indictment aimed at President Trump. The indictment is otherwise pointless as the Russian government will certainly not turn over its military personnel to a Washington kangeroo court. The indictment serves no purpose except to poison the atmosphere of the summit. ### If you read the indictment, you will see that it consists of nothing but improbable accusations. There is no way on earth that the US Justice (sic) Department would be able to acquire the information in this fictional story that Rosenstein has presented. Moreover, there is no sign whatsoever of any evidence in the indictment. Rosenstein knows that he needs no evidence, because the accused will never be brought to trial. ### Rosenstein has thrown red meat to the presstitutes, who are assets of the military/security complex and Democratic Party, and the presstitutes will pressure the Republicans to get behind Rosenstein’s call for a united front against Russian interference. You can imagine what would happen if Trump and Putin were to have a successful summit and normalize the relations that Washington ruined between the two countries. If your imagination is not working, consult here . ### During the presidential election campaign, I pointed out that Trump was not Washington savvy, did not know who would support his positions, which were antithetical to the interests of powerful interest groups such as the military-security complex and global offshoring corporations, and that Trump ran the risk of being destroyed by his own appointments. ### Rod Rosenstein is a Trump appointment. Moreover when Trump’s Attorney General ordered Rosenstein’s resignation, Trump refused to accept it and kept Rosenstein in office. Trump’s miscalculation is so enormously wrong that he deserves the knife in the back that Rosenstein just delivered. ### If there were a valid indictment of 12 Russians, for the sake of the summit’s success, a normal functioning deputy attorney general would have held the indictment until after the summit results and, if the summit were successful, would have deep-sixed the indictment regardless of whether there is a basis for it. ### My 25 years in Washington tells me clearly that Rosenstein has knifed Trump in the back. If Rosenstein has caused the summit to fail, Rosenstein has raised the risk of thermo-nuclear warfare. ### There is an alternative to the explanation above. The alternative is that Trump, being a bully, was convinced by those in his administration, who most certainly do not want any normalization with Russia, that the indictment would put Putin on the spot and give Trump the advantage in the bullying arena. I can hear the CIA and John Bolton telling Trump that the indictment would put Putin on the defensive and permit Trump to pressure him into a summit outcome favorable to Washington’s hegemony. ### This is a clever way of setting Trump up for failure in his meeting with Putin that could possibly poison the relations between the countries ever further without the failure being blamed on Rosenstein. Thus, Rosenstein’s position as Trump’s political assassin would not be threatened. He would still be running Russiagate with a recused Jeff Sessions sitting there useless. ### Professor Stephen Cohen is a premier expert on US/Russian elections . His considered view, via The Nation , is compatible with mine: ### Stephen F. Cohen, professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at NYU and Princeton, and John Batchelor continue their (usually) weekly discussions of the new US-Russian Cold War. (You can find previous installments, now in their fifth year, at  TheNation.com .) ### As Cohen pointed out in previous discussions, US-Russian (Soviet and post-Soviet) summits are a long tradition going back to FDR’s wartime meeting with Stalin in Yalta in 1943. Every American president since FDR met with a Kremlin leader in a summit-style format at least once, several doing so multiple times. The purpose was always to resolve conflicts and enhance cooperation in relations between the two countries. Some summits succeeded, some did not,  but all were thought to be an essential aspect of White House-Kremlin relations . ### As a rule, American presidents have departed for summits with bipartisan support and well-wishes. Trump’s upcoming meeting with Russian President Putin, in Helsinki on July 16, is profoundly different in two respects. US-Russian relations have rarely, if ever,  been more dangerous . And never before has a president’s departure—in Trump’s case, first for a NATO summit and then the one with Putin—been accompanied by allegations that he is disloyal to the United States and thus cannot be trusted, defamations once issued only by extremist fringe elements in American politics. Now, however, we are told this daily by mainstream publications, broadcasts, and “think tanks.” According to a representative of the Clintons’ Center for American Progress, “ Trump is going to sell out America and its allies .” The New York Times and The Washington Post also feature “experts”—they are chosen accordingly—who  “worry” and “fear” that Trump and Putin “ will get along .” The Times of London, a bastion of Russophobic Cold War advocacy, captures the mainstream perspective in a single headline: “ Fears Grow Over Prospect of Trump ‘Peace Deal’ with Putin .” ### An anti-“peace” Washington establishment is, of course, what still-unproven Russiagate allegations have wrought, as  summed up by a New Yorkmagazine writer  who advises us that the Trump-Putin summit may well be “less a negotiation between two heads of state than a meeting between a Russian-intelligence asset and his handler.” The charge is hardly original, having been made for months at MSNBC by the questionably credentialed “intelligence expert” Malcolm Nance and the, it seems, selectively informed Rachel Maddow, among many other “experts.” Considering today’s perilous geopolitical situation, it is hard not to conclude that much of the American political establishment, particularly the Democratic Party, would prefer trying to impeach Trump to averting war with Russia, the other nuclear superpower. For this too, there is no precedent in American history. ### Not surprisingly, Trump’s dreaded visit to the NATO summit has only inflated the uncritical cult of that organization, which has been in search of a purpose and ever more funding since the end of the Soviet Union in 1991. The New York Times declares that NATO is “ the core of an American-led liberal world order ,” an assertion that might startle many of the non-military institutions involved and even some liberals. No less puzzling is the ritualistic characterization of NATO as “the greatest military alliance in history.” It has never—thankfully—gone to war as an alliance, only a few “willing” member (and would-be member) states under US leadership. Even then, what counts as “great victories”? The police action in the Balkans in the 1990s? The disasters in the aftermath of Iraq and Libya? The longest, still-ongoing American war in history, in Afghanistan? NATO’s only real mission since the 1990s has been expanding to Russia’s borders, and that has resulted in less, not more, security for all concerned, as is evident today. The only “Russian threat” since the end of the Soviet Union is one provoked by the US-led NATO itself, from Georgia and Ukraine to the Baltic states. And only NATO’s vast corporate bureaucracy, its some 4,000 employees housed in its  new $1.2 billion headquarters in Brussels , and US and other weapons manufacturers who gain from each new member state, have profited. But none of this can be discussed in the mainstream, because Trump uttered a few words questioning NATO’s role and funding, even though the subject has been on the agenda of several think tanks since the 1990s. ### Also not surprisingly, and unlike in the past, mainstream media have found little place for serious discussion of today’s dangerous conflicts between Washington and Moscow: regarding nuclear-weapons-imitation treaties, cyber-warfare, Syria, Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the Black Sea region, even Afghanistan. It’s easy to imagine how Trump and Putin could agree on conflict-reduction and cooperation in all of these realms. But considering the traducing by the  Post ,  Times , and  Maddow  of a group of senators who visited Moscow around July 4, it’s much harder to see how the defamed Trump could implement such “peace deals.” ( There is a long history  of sabotaging or attempting to sabotage summits and other détente-like initiatives. Indeed, a few such attempts have been evident in recent months and more may lie ahead.) ### Nor is the unreasonably demonized Putin without constraints at home, though none like those that may cripple Trump. The Kremlin’s long-postponed decision to raise the pension age for Russian men and women has caused his popular ratings, though still high, to drop some 8 to 10 percent in recent weeks. More significantly, segments of the Russian military-security establishment  do not trust  Putin’s admitted “illusions” about negotiating with Washington in the past. And like their American counterparts, they do not trust Trump, whom they too view as unreliable, if not capricious. These Russian “hard-liners” have made their concerns known publicly, and Putin must take them into account. As has been a function of summits over the decades, he is seeking in Trump a reliable national-security partner. Given the constraints on Trump and his proclivities, Putin too is taking a risk, and he knows it. ### Even if nothing more specific is achieved, everyone who cares about American and international security should hope that the Trump-Putin summit results at least in a restoration of the diplomatic process, the longstanding “contacts,” between Washington and Moscow that have been greatly diminished, if not destroyed, by the new Cold War and by Russiagate allegations. Cold War without diplomacy is a recipe for actual war. ### We should also hope that the Democratic Party’s reaction to the summit, in its pursuit of Trump, does not make it the party of unrelenting Cold War, as it may be already becoming."

It doesn’t mean anything. It means that they are competitive.” ### Trump has been reluctant to criticize Putin over the years and has described him in recent days not as an enemy but as a competitor. ### On Sunday, Trump flew to Finland, the final stop on a weeklong trip that began last Tuesday. Near Trump’s hotel, police roped off a group of about 60 mostly male pro-Trump demonstrators waving American flags. Big banners said “Welcome Trump” and “God Bless D & M Trump” and a helicopter hovered overhead. ### Chants of “We love Trump, We love Trump” broke out as the president’s motorcade passed, and Trump waved. ### Trump set expectations for the summit low, telling CBS News, “I don’t expect anything. … I go in with very low expectations.” His national security adviser said they weren’t looking for any “concrete deliverables.” ### He also said in the interview taped Saturday that he “hadn’t thought” about asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in Washington on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ### But after being given the idea by his interviewer, Trump said, “Certainly I’ll be asking about it.” ### Related Articles ### Trump stands by “culture” criticism of European immigration ### The U.S. has no extradition treaty with Moscow and can’t compel Russia to hand over citizens. Russia’s constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens to foreign countries. ### Contradicting Trump in an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the idea of asking Putin to turn over the 12 military intelligence officials was “pretty silly” and argued that doing so would put the U.S. president in a “weak position.” ### He also argued that Trump is entering the summit with a stronger hand because of the indictments. ### “I think the president can put this on the table and say, ‘This is a serious matter that we need to talk about,'” said Bolton, adding that asking for the indicted Russians to be turned over would have the opposite effect. ### In the CBS News interview, Trump declined to discuss his goals for the summit — “I’ll let you know after the meeting,” he said — but said he believes such sessions are beneficial. ### He cited his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June as a “good thing,” along with meetings he’s had with Chinese President Xi Jinping. ### “Nothing bad is going to come out of” the Helsinki meeting, he said, “and maybe some good will come out.” ### From aboard Air Force One, Trump complained in tweets that he wasn’t getting enough credit for his meeting with Kim and railed that “Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people” as he headed to sit down with Putin. ### Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some Russian journalists. Trump regularly criticizes American news media outlets and has called out some journalists by name. ### Trump complained: “No matter how well I do at the Summit,” he’ll face “criticism that it wasn’t good enough.” ### “If I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough — that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” he tweeted. ### Trump also praised Putin for holding the World Cup, which finished up Sunday. ### Trump and Putin have held talks several times before. Their first meeting came last July when both participated in an international summit and continued for more than two hours, well over the scheduled 30 minutes. The leaders also met last fall during a separate summit in Vietnam. ### But Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, said Monday’s meeting “is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation, and I hope it’s a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests.” ### Congressional Democrats and at least one Republican have called on Trump to pull out of Monday’s meeting unless he is willing to make Russian election-meddling the top issue. Huntsman said the summit must go on because Russian engagement is needed to solve some international issues. ### “The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off-the-charts high so it’s a good thing these presidents are getting together,” he said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” ### Trump has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling, along with Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation and other topics. Bolton described the meeting as “unstructured” and said: “We’re not looking for concrete deliverables here.” ### Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington and Jamey Keaten in Helsinki contributed to this report. ### Tags: ### Trump tweets, hits links before high-stakes Putin meeting ### July 14, 2018, 5:49 pm ### Two days before a high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump played golf and tweeted Saturday from one of his namesake resorts, blaming his predecessor for Russian election meddling and lashing out at the free press from foreign soil. ### 12 Russians indicted for meddling in 2016 U.S. election ### July 13, 2018, 9:01 pm ### Twelve Russian military intelligence officers hacked into the Clinton presidential campaign and Democratic Party and released tens of thousands of private communications in a sweeping conspiracy by the Kremlin to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election, according to an indictment announced days before President Donald Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### PHOTOS: President Trump meets the Queen of England ### July 13, 2018, 12:00 pm ### Her Majesty welcomed the President and Mrs Trump at the dais in the Quadrangle of the Castle.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) ### It’s not clear which came first, President Trump’s comment to CBS in an interview this weekend arguing that the European Union is a “foe” of the United States  or the statement from Germany’s foreign minister expressing concerns about his country’s relationship with the United States. But the two are related. ### Minister Heiko Maas told a German newspaper group that “[w]e can no longer completely rely on the White House.” He suggested that the relationship with the United States would need to be “readjusted” and that Germany should align itself more closely with Europe. ### Maas’s comment mirrors one from German Chancellor Angela Merkel last year. “The times in which we can fully count on others are somewhat over, as I have experienced in the past few days,” she said in May 2017 after meeting with Trump. ### There’s a clear difference being drawn by Maas though, between “the White House” and the United States. And he’s not alone. ABC News spoke with senior European officials who drew a similar distinction, explaining that they are “starting to see President Donald Trump as separate from the United States, and are instead focusing on the long history of partnership between the U.S. and Europe rather than his words.” ### Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, drew the distinction on Twitter with a slightly sharper tongue. ### America and the EU are best friends. Whoever says we are foes is spreading fake news. ### — Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) July 15, 2018 ### That divide between president and presidency is recognized in America as well, nowhere more obviously than on the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 election. ### The idea that Russia had worked to influence the vote that year was first posited by U.S. intelligence agencies during the administration of Barack Obama, but confidence in that culpability only grew once Trump was inaugurated. On Friday, a grand jury considering findings by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III indicted 12 Russian nationals believed to work for the country’s intelligence service on charges that they’d hacked the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman. ### That indictment joined another in which 13 Russians and three Russian companies were charged with trying to influence the election on social media. Members of Trump’s Cabinet, members of his party in Congress and those running the intelligence agencies in his administration have repeatedly argued that Russia did attempt to interfere with the election, with one aim being to benefit his campaign. ### Trump himself, though, tried for a long time to deny that Russia had interfered with the election at all, apparently concerned that such an effort would undermine his legitimacy as president. When he asked Russian President Vladimir Putin if he had interfered last year, he touted Putin’s denials and lamented that Putin was “insulted” by the implication. Recently, he’s seemingly acquiesced to the idea that Russia was culpable, choosing instead to blame the Obama administration for it happening in the first place. The investigation into that interference, of course, is a biased “witch hunt” in his view, one that has resulted in nearly 200 criminal charges and guilty pleas. ### For months, though, there was that weird tension: Trump’s people were saying something different than Trump himself. We’d seen other examples of this, like the State Department under former secretary of state Rex Tillerson disagreeing with Trump’s foreign-policy pronouncements. Nowhere was it more prominent than on Russian interference, though. ### In one weird way, this divide between Trump and his administration worked to Trump’s advantage. ### When Congress passed sweeping new sanctions meant to punish Russia for its actions, Trump had little choice but to grudgingly sign them into law. (They were belatedly implemented in part earlier this year.) When a former Russian intelligence official was poisoned in Britain earlier this year, the State Department booted 60 Russian officers from the United States, joining NATO allies in pushing back. Trump, The Washington Post reported, was “not heavily engaged in the discussion” to do so. ### Trump has said little publicly to criticize Russia for the interference and nothing on the poisoning — but he, his administration and his defenders have pointed to the sanctions as evidence of how tough he’s been on Russia. Trump, who has said he thinks he and Putin might end up as friends, gets to take credit for the sanctions while being able to downplay them, if desired, to Putin himself. ### Again, that, to some extent, is how foreign allies may look at his presidency: What the U.S. government is doing is not necessarily a reflection of what Trump is saying, and vice versa. The benefit to this, mirroring Trump allies’ sporadic embrace of sanctions against Russia, is obvious. The functions of the presidency can be separated from the contentious words of the president. Trump’s popularity with the Republican base is certainly in part a function of his willingness to scorch his political opponents — but his popularity with Republicans overall is also a function of his embracing traditional Republican policies, however unenthusiastically. Many Republicans look past what he says to see what his administration does. ### America’s traditional allies are skeptical of Trump and wary, it seems, of what his election says about the solidity of American leadership. But, for better or worse, Trump isn’t always seen as a representative of the United States itself — an unusual situation, to say the least. ### The story must be told. ### Your subscription supports journalism that matters."

But it’s possible we won’t.” ### Just days after the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller yielded indictments against 12 Russian intelligence agents — the first time Russian government officials have been charged for efforts to interfere with the 2016 election — Trump said that seeking assurances from Putin that the charged individuals would be extradited to the United States to face the charges was not at the top of his mind. ### “Well, I might. I hadn’t thought of that, but, certainly, I will be asking about it,” Trump said. ### But Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike said that issue should be a basic starting point for the talks. ### “The president must demand that the 12 Russians named in the indictment be sent to the U.S. to stand trial,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Senate’s top Democrat. ### Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who chairs the House Oversight Committee, said Trump should demand that the dozen Russian officials as well as the 13 Russian nationals already indicted by Mueller be brought to the U.S. ### “Your first requests of Vladimir Putin needs to be: ‘Tell us which airport we can pick up the 25 Russians that tried to interfere with the fundamentals of our democracy,’ ” Gowdy said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” ### “If you really claim you had nothing to do with it then you should be as shocked as we were that your military was being used to impact our election.” ### But Trump’s top aide signaled that would not be the approach the president takes. ### “We have asked and the Russians have agreed that it will be basically unstructured,” national security adviser John Bolton said yesterday on ABC’s “This Week.” “We’re not looking for concrete deliverables here.”"

I'm not going with high expectations."" ### The president taped the interview Saturday in Scotland. CBS News released excerpts on Sunday, hours before Trump was set to fly to Helsinki, where he will meet with Putin. ### Trump says such sessions are beneficial. He cited his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June as ""a good thing"" and says ""having meetings with Russia, China, North Korea, I believe in it."" ### ""Nothing bad is going to come out of it (Helsinki), and maybe some good will come out,"" he said. ### Trump and Putin have met twice before, during international summits last year in Germany and Vietnam. But Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, says Monday's meeting ""is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation and I hope it's a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests."" ### Trump has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling with Putin, in addition to Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation and other topics. ### Congressional Democrats and at least one Republican have called on the president to pull out of the meeting unless he is willing to make Russian election-meddling a top issue for the summit. Huntsman said the meeting will go on, arguing that some international issues can't be solved with Russian engagement. ### ""Right now, there's no trust in the relationship and, because of that, problem-solving is practically impossible,"" Huntsman said. ""So this is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama and quite frankly some of the danger out of the relationship right now."" ### ""The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off-the-charts high so it's a good thing these presidents are getting together,"" he added. ### Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., suggested that Trump not even bother to press Putin on election meddling because ""he's not going to admit that he did it."" Instead, Paul said Trump and other U.S. officials should focus on safeguarding upcoming elections from interference. ### Huntsman was interviewed on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and Paul appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ### Close"

With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ""I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,"" Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### ""The fact that we're having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,"" said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. ""What is important here is that we start a discussion."" ### Trump has been drawn to the spectacle of the summit and has expressed an eagerness to recreate in Helsinki the media show of last month's Singapore summit when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Even as many NATO leaders made supportive noises this week, the Helsinki summit has raised fears in many global capitals that Trump will pull back from traditional Western alliances, allowing Putin to expand his sphere of influence. ### Back home, too, there is wariness on Capitol Hill, with a number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans urging Trump to cancel the summit in the wake of the explosive indictments. ### But Trump has vowed that he can handle Putin, whom he has taken to referring to as a ""competitor"" rather than an adversary. ### And Trump in recent days has outlined some of the items he'd like to discuss, including Ukraine. Though the president has said he was ""not happy"" about Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, he puts the blame on his predecessor and says he will continue relations with Putin even if Moscow refuses to return the peninsula. ### Trump also said he and Putin would discuss the ongoing war in Syria and arms control, negotiations that White House officials have signaled could be fruitful. ### ""I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,"" the president said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. ""We've been modernizing and fixing and buying. And it's just a devastating technology. And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it's a very, very bad policy."" ### But it is the matter of election meddling, including fears Russia could try to interfere in the midterm elections this fall, that could play a central role in the summit talks or loom even larger if not addressed. In neither of Trump's previous meetings with Putin — informal talks on the sidelines of summits last year in Germany and Vietnam — did the president publicly upbraid the Russian leader, prompting questions about whether he believed the former KGB officer's denials over his own intelligence agencies' assessments of meddling. ### Trump repeatedly has cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking of his Democratic rivals and disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise it with Putin even as he downplayed its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### WHAT PUTIN WANTS ### For Putin, sitting down with Trump offers a long-awaited chance to begin repairing relations with Washington after years of spiraling tensions. ### Putin wants the U.S. and its allies to lift sanctions, pull back NATO forces deployed near Russia's borders and restore business as usual with Moscow. In the longer run, he hopes to persuade the U.S. to acknowledge Moscow's influence over its former Soviet neighbors and, more broadly, recognize Russia as a global player whose interests must be taken into account. ### These are long-term goals, and Putin realizes that no significant progress will come from just one meeting. More than anything else, he sees Monday's summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### ""Russia-U.S. ties aren't just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. ""It's unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don't meet."" ### Moscow views Trump's criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump's election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament's upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won't engage in vague talk about ""illusory subjects,"" such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia's return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he's likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be ""pointless"" to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea's status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine's push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### ""Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,"" Lukyanov said. ""But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident."""

Putin landed in Helsinki behind schedule for the summit. ### The use of the Kortezh could be a show of Russian pride to counter the U.S. president’s world famous limousine known as “The Beast.” ### Putin’s motorcade included several other vehicles of the same Kortezh, or Aurus family. ### ___ ### 1:05 p.m. ### President Vladimir Putin has arrived late for his high-profile meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump — another display of the Russian’s leader famous lack of punctuality. ### Putin’s plane touched down in Helsinki 30 minutes later than planned, pushing back the start of his one-on-one talks with Trump Monday. ### In the past, Putin was late for meetings with Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II and Pope Francis, among many others. ### In 2014, he was hours late for meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, after his previous stop in Serbia lasted longer than usual. ### Often seen as a trick to throw his interlocutors off balance, Putin’s tardy ways appear to be more of a personal trait than a well-calculated strategy. ### __ ### 12:45 p.m. ### Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman says he hopes the summit with U.S. President Donald Trump is a “baby step” toward fixing exceptionally bad U.S.-Russian relations. ### Ahead of Monday’s meeting, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told broadcaster RT that the men had no strict agenda but recognize their “special responsibility” for global stability. ### He said European countries shouldn’t be worried about a possible U.S.-Russian rapprochement or decisions about Europe made “over the heads of Europeans.” ### Peskov said the Russian leader respects Trump’s “America first” stance because Putin puts Russia first, but said the only way to make progress at the summit is if both sides are open to finding areas of mutual benefit. ### Russian officials say Putin is expected to reiterate denials of meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. ### __ ### 12:35 p.m. ### U.S. first lady Melania Trump says she and her Finnish counterpart had a “good conversation about issues facing our nations.” ### Mrs. Trump says in a tweet that she enjoyed Monday’s talk, adding “Thank you to @JenniHaukio for hosting me!” ### Haukio is the wife of Sauli Niinistö (SAW-lee KNEE-nes-tuh), the president of Finland, which is welcoming Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin of Russia for a summit. ### The first ladies met separately over breakfast while their husbands held talks. ### Meanwhile, the Finnish tabloid Iltalehti took the American first lady to task with a front-page photo tweaking her for an alleged “breach of etiquette” because she walked off of Air Force One in front of President Trump after they landed at the airport in Helsinki on Sunday night. ### __ ### 12:05 p.m. ### Finland’s biggest newspaper has a message for Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin: Respect a free press. ### Daily Helsingin Sanomat has placed advertisements around Helsinki alluding to Finland’s reputation as a hub for a free press. The advocacy group Reporters Without Borders has regularly ranked Finland among the top in its “Press Freedom Index” — including the No. 1 spot two years ago. ### The Russian in one of the black and white ads translates to: “Unpleasant things will happen to journalists who ask Putin questions.” ### An English version for Trump said: “Mr. President, welcome to the land of free press.” ### Trump regularly berates some news outlets as purveyors of “fake news.” Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence that has led to the killing of some Russian journalists. ### ___ ### 11:40 a.m. ### The European Union’s foreign policy chief says the United States has remained a “friend” of the 28-nation bloc and said “a change in the administration does not change the friendship between countries and peoples.” ### On Sunday, President Donald Trump named the European Union as a top adversary of the United States, saying “the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade.” He added that “you wouldn’t think of the European Union, but they’re a foe.” ### The EU’s Federica Mogherini (feh-deh-REE’-kah moh-gehr-EE’-nee) says ahead of Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers that “for sure, we consider the United States friends, partners – close friends and partners.

Finland is not a member nation but has a memorandum of understanding with NATO. ### Finland has also been the site of previous US-Russia summits. ### __ ### 9:50 a.m. ### President Donald Trump is meeting with the Finnish president ahead of his summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. ### Trump has arrived at the the Mäntyniemi Residence in Helsinki, where he and first lady Melania Trump were greeted by President Sauli Niinistö (SAW-lee KNEE-nes-tuh) and his wife. ### The leaders were seen surveying the view from a small balcony before sitting down for breakfast. ### Trump will then be returning to his hotel before heading to the presidential palace for his highly anticipated talks with Putin. ### Finland has a long legacy of hosting U.S.-Soviet and U.S.-Russian summits due to its geographic location and perceived neutrality. ### __ ### 9:45 a.m. ### President Donald Trump is no fan of American journalists, but might love what the Russian media are saying about him ahead of his meeting with Russian Vladimir Putin. ### Russia’s largely Kremlin-friendly TV networks, websites and newspapers portrayed Trump as a political maverick who is being unfairly targeted by his own compatriots. ### Newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda dismissed the U.S. investigation into Trump’s “mythical work for the Kremlin,” and praised Trump for meeting Putin “despite opposition from his own elite and the hysterics of the media.” ### Commentators on popular Sunday night talk show “Vecher” or “Evening” said Putin goes into Monday’s summit in Helsinki as the stronger figure, notably coming off his hosting of the World Cup. ### They brushed off new indictments of Russians accused of hacking the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. ### __ ### 9:20 a.m. ### President Donald Trump says the U.S. relationship with Russia “has NEVER been worse” as he prepares for a high-stakes summit Monday with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. ### Trump in a tweet is blaming the hostilities on “many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” ### That’s Trump’s favorite derogatory term for the special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling and possible ties to his campaign that has already led to a slew of indictments, including of a dozen Russian intelligence officers last week. ### Trump is also once again blaming his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia’s efforts in the 2016 election. ### He says Obama “thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election,” so he did “NOTHING” about it when informed by the FBI. ### __ ### 9:05 a.m. ### President Donald Trump is claiming credit for bolstering NATO as he heads into a day of meetings with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. ### Trump rocked a NATO summit last week when he lambasted members for failing to meet defense spending pledges and questioned the value of the alliance before doing a 180 and embracing it. ### But Trump says in a tweet that he’s received “many calls from leaders of NATO countries” thanking him for helping “to get them focused on financial obligations, both present & future.” ### Trump says, “We had a truly great Summit” and claims it was “inaccurately covered by much of the media.” ### Foreign policy observers will be watching to see whether Trump has kinder words for Putin in Helsinki than he did for NATO leaders in Brussels. ### __ ### 7:50 a.m. ### European Council President Donald Tusk has urged President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and China to work with Europe to avoid trade wars and prevent conflict and chaos. ### Tusk was speaking Monday in Beijing at the opening of a summit between China and the European Union. He noted that Trump and Putin’s summit in Helsinki would take place on the same day in Helsinki. ### Of the summit, Tusk said: “We are all aware of the fact that the architecture of the world is changing before our very eyes and it is our common responsibility to make it a change for the better.” ### Tusk said Europe, China, the U.S. and Russia had a “common duty” not to destroy the global order but to improve it by reforming international trade rules. ### ___ ### 7:10 a.m. ### President Donald Trump and Russia’s Vladimir Putin are ready to go one-on-one in Finland. ### Their summit Monday in Helsinki will play out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, the investigation into Russian election meddling and fears that Moscow’s aggression may go unpunished. ### The meeting was condemned in advance by an assortment of members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russians accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump. ### Undeterred, the American president is set to go face-to-face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### Questions are swirling about whether Trump will sharply rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe."
5375,beforeitsnews.com,2018-07-15T12:39:07-04:00,"Joe Biden Blames Mitch McConnell For Russian Interference in the 2016 Campaign ### Sunday, July 15, 2018 9:17 ### % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents. ### The revelations, via FOIA and declassified documents and Congressional testimony and media reports and Mueller’s various indictments, that the Obama administration knew about the rather feeble attempts of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election and did absolutely nothing. ### For instance, Mueller’s first indictment that had any relationship at all to his mission, that of thirteen Russian “hackers” and three Russian companies (one of which, inconveniently, didn’t even exist in 2016 ), we find that the federal counterintelligence agencies had been watching this group since 2013 and when some of them visited the US in 2015 they were shadowed by the FBI. ### We know that in September 2016, Susan Rice issued a “stand down” order to National Security Council cybersecurity coordinator Michael Daniel in regards to defending against Russian cyber operations. ### Why the administration was reluctant to drop the hammer on the Russians is pretty obvious. Obama viewed Russia, like he viewed Iran, as a counterweight to American influence. By making both these powers stronger withing their sphere of influence, he reduced the ability of the United States to operate in those areas. He’d wooed the Russians from a very early point with the whole “reset” nonsense, pulling the plug on US ballistic missile defense sites in eastern Europe, and acquiescing to Russian adventurism in Moldova and Ukraine. In fact, when a Russian spy ring was busted as it insinuated its way into Hillary’s orbit, the members were simply deported rather than being subjected to a public trial and sentencing and serving some time in a federal prison. ### The Obama administration literally tried to hit the reset button back in 2009, except they misspelled the button. Furthermore, Obama promised #Russia he’d have more “flexibility” after his re-election. President Trump is taking a different approach. @Uncle_Jimbo explains. pic.twitter.com/5XDrmy4mk1 ### — Security Studies Group (@SecStudiesGrp) July 15, 2018 ### Not only did Obama turn a blind eye to this crap, he actually enlisted the Russians to represent US interests in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal and invited them into Syria for reasons that remain obscure if one rules out Obama being a Russian agent-in-place. ### The bottom line reason was that the Obama administration expected Hillary Clinton to win. They knew the Russian operations were largely bullsh** and had no electoral influence. And they didn’t want Obama’s successor to be confronted with a nasty diplomatic spat with Russia over their actions. ### But the questions are mounting, and now the Obama alumni association has sent out America’s Rain Man, goofy Uncle Joe Biden, to start a counter narrative . ### Joe Biden said Tuesday that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stopped the Obama administration from speaking out about Russian interference in the 2016 campaign by refusing to sign on to a bipartisan statement of condemnation. ### That moment, the former Democratic vice president said, made him think “the die had been cast … this was all about the political play.” ### … ### Biden said he and former President Barack Obama worried that without a united front of bipartisanship, speaking out before the election would undermine the legitimacy of the election and American institutions in a way that would play into the Russians’ larger ambitions. ### “Can you imagine if the president called a press conference in October, with this fella, Bannon, and company, and said, ‘Tell you what: Russians are trying to interfere in our elections and we have to do something about it,’” Biden said. “What do you think would have happened? Would things have gotten better, or would it further look like we were trying to delegitimize the electoral process, because of our opponent?” ### … ### But a former Obama White House official on Tuesday afternoon echoed Biden’s frustration with the Senate majority leader, pointing to the way Obama’s White House chief of staff Denis McDonough described the dispute in an op-ed last summer. ### “Our administration’s interest in making sure the response was bipartisan wasn’t for the sake of being bipartisan. It was necessary because we needed the buy-in from state and local election administrators (many of whom were Republican partisans and/or skeptical of federal government),” the official argued in an email. “Unfortunately, as is well documented, Senator McConnell was unwilling to help — only making matters worse.” ### Biden told Tuesday’s gathering that there was a “constant tightrope,” with the Obama administration unable to decide what would count as saying too little or too much. ### “The president and I would sit there literally after the [presidential daily briefing], after everyone had left the room, and say, ‘What the hell are we going to do?’” Biden recalled. ### Notice the clever conflation of “doing something” with “speaking out.” In 2016, any elected Republican who trusted anything said by Barack Obama should have been medicated and institutionalized. There is zero doubt that the Obama administration “speaking out” would have been a raw, partisan activity. Moreover, the nation knew that and the reason they didn’t “speak out” is because they knew this would signal to everyone that the Clinton campaign was on the the ropes and Obama was trying to save her. Beyond that, what would the message have been? “Don’t read Facebook posts?” ### The question left unanswered by Amtrak Joe is why the administration failed to act. Why was a stand down order give? Why were Russian operatives monitored in the US and allowed to go about their business? But, as I pointed out earlier, we all know the reason for that. The Russian meddling in the 2016 election was a) minor, b) juvenile, c) ineffective, and d) everyone knew Hillary was going to win."

Follow him on Facebook. ### Print ### President Donald Trump (Photo: Twitter) ### Is it just me, or is everyone missing the biggest, most mind-boggling part of the never-ending “Trump-Russia collusion” drama? ### Let’s set aside all the deceit, demagoguery and mass hysteria associated with the left’s ongoing campaign to overturn Trump’s election by endlessly accusing him of “colluding with the Russians,” and consider the biggest scandal of all: ### For the past 100 years, it’s the left that has been continually “colluding with the Russians.” ### For something like three generations this nation’s most vital institutions, from higher education to Hollywood, have been powerfully influenced, if not entirely dominated, by the Marxist-socialist worldview incubated, nurtured, celebrated, propagandized and exported primarily by Russia. ### As I have  documented, today’s Democratic Party, pushed radically leftward by President Barack Obama (whom both former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy and ex-New Left leader David Horowitz accurately call a “neocommunist”), has become almost indistinguishable from the Communist Party USA. In case you didn’t know, the CPUSA came into existence as a U.S.-based, Moscow-controlled-and-funded communist party, but has lost most of its influence and support since the Soviet Union collapsed, thanks to President Ronald Reagan. Today, the CPUSA no longer fields its own presidential candidates, but rather, urges voters to support Democrats, having enthusiastically endorsed John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. ### If you think this comparison of the Democratic Party with the Communist Party USA is hyperbolic, I suggest – as I have previously  – that you “just stop reading right now and pull up the CPUSA’s website. Spend some time reading and digesting it. Try to discern any major differences between the Communist Party’s concerns, sensibilities and solutions – on issues from gay rights, to unfettered immigration, to renewable energy, to wealth redistribution, to condemning cops as racist, to universal health care – and those of today’s Democratic Party.” ### Currently, CPUSA.org includes articles supporting Obamacare, warning about global warming, advocating the impeachment of Trump,  advocating for expansive immigrant rights , attacking the wealthy “1 percent,” decrying racism in America and other bread-and-butter issues of today’s Democratic Party. ### Remember also that the Democratic Party’s rapid leftward drift while Obama steered the American ship of state for eight years was characterized by actual “collusion with the Russians,” including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s official agreement to hand over control of one-fifth of America’s strategic uranium reserves to Russia, in return for which millions of dollars flowed from Russia to the Clinton Foundation – not to mention $500,000 to husband Bill for giving a one-hour speech in Moscow. And who can forget President Barack Obama being caught on a hot mic saying to Russian President Medvedev, “This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility.” (Translation: After I’m re-elected president, I can do things Putin wants, but that the American people would never approve of.) To which comrade Medvedev replied, “I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir, and I stand with you.” ### Get David Kupelian’s culture-war blockbuster books “The Marketing of Evil,” “How Evil Works” and his latest, “The Snapping of the American Mind” at the WND Superstore. Also available in ebook and audiobook versions. ### Then of course during the 2016 presidential primaries we had Bernie Sanders, the “aging hippie communist” (in Rush Limbaugh’s words) who honeymooned with his bride in the Soviet Union, yet who might arguably have won the Democratic presidential nomination had the Democratic National Committee not scandalously rigged the primary contest for Hillary Clinton. ### Putting aside the defamatory “collusion” allegation against Trump, as well as all the wild-eyed leftwing incantations that Russia “hacked our democracy” (a mysterious accusation no one can define because it doesn’t actually mean anything), you may reasonably wonder what to think about the broader and more basic charge that Russia tried to influence the 2016 American election. After all, Robert Mueller just indicted a dozen Russian hackers for exactly that. ### Reality check: Everyone even modestly aware of modern geopolitical history knows Russia has been attempting to influence America and her elections for decades. In fact, most powerful nations, including America, attempt to influence other nations’ politics and elections – it’s called foreign policy. ### Even worse, during Reagan’s first term as president, liberal Sen. Edward “Ted” Kennedy made secret overtures to the Soviet Union to thwart Reagan’s re-election! Yes, this actually happened! When I reached out to Reagan biographer and Russia scholar Paul Kengor, he nailed the details – and the media’s stunning hypocrisy. ### “Democrats are searching desperately, frantically, hysterically, for any tangible proof that Trump or one of his aides or associates was reaching out to the Russians to influence the 2016 election,” Kengor, a political science professor at Grove City College, told me. “Well, the May 1983 KGB document between Victor Chebrikov (head of the KGB at the time) and Yuri Andropov (head of the USSR at the time) details an offer from Ted Kennedy to help the Russians prior to Ronald Reagan’s 1984 election campaign.” Kennedy’s purpose? Prevent Reagan’s re-election. ### “It’s an actual official Soviet document,” Kengor told me, “one that was housed in the Central Committee archives until it was discovered after the Cold War in 1992. I first published the document in full in my 2006 book on Ronald Reagan, “The Crusader.” (See the original Soviet document memorializing Sen. Edward Kennedy’s collusion with Russia, first in Russian and then translated into English.) ### But wait, weren’t the “mainstream media” alarmed, once they found out, that a U.S. senator had attempted to subvert the reelection of a sitting U.S. president by “colluding with the Russians”? ### As Kengor told me: “That entire time, Ted Kennedy was alive and could have been questioned about this. But the fact is that the Democrats and the liberals in the media didn’t give a damn. Why? Because Ted Kennedy was one of their darlings. They had no interest or intention in exposing any possible Ted Kennedy dealings or – worse – potential collaboration or collusion with the Russians. They could give a rip. But now, in the Trump era, the Democrats and liberals are suddenly Russia hawks.” ### To put this whole issue of “Russian influence” into proper context, I reached out to someone who has more firsthand knowledge of the subject than almost anyone else alive – my good friend, Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa, the highest-ranking Soviet-bloc defector to the West during the entire Cold War. “Mike,” who now lives in the U.S. as a proud American citizen, was once a top communist spymaster in the Soviet disinformation world whose fulltime business was influencing America and her elections! (I had the honor of serving as editor of Pacepa’s epic 2013 book, “Disinformation,” co-authored with Professor Ronald Rychlak, and we have been dialoguing ever since.) ### “Mike,” I emailed recently. “How long would you say Russia has been actively trying to influence American society, politics and elections?” I explained the gist of the article I was writing about the American left’s century-long secret “collusion” with Russia. ### Russia, he said, has been attempting to influence America for more than half a century, adding pointedly: “The leaders of our Democratic Party have known at least for seven decades that Russia was trying to influence the U.S. policies and her elections process – it was an open secret.” Former CIA Director R. James Woolsey, who wrote the “Introduction” to Pacepa’s “Disinformation” book, concurs, saying Russia has been trying to influence America’s political and electoral direction “since at least the 1940s, and possibly going back into the 30s.” ### Pacepa, once director of foreign intelligence for communist Romania and a top adviser to the infamous dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, courageously defected to the U.S. in 1978. Ceausescu immediately had a nervous breakdown and put a $2 million bounty on Pacepa’s head, dispatching multiple assassination squads, including the notorious terrorist Illich Ramirez Sanchez (“Carlos the Jackal”) to the U.S. to find his former top adviser and kill him. Fortunately, all such efforts were unsuccessful. ### “When I broke with my life at the top of the Soviet empire,” Mike reminded me in his email, “I paid with two death sentences from my native Romania for helping her people to stop thinking of government as a boon bestowed from on high, and to free itself from the clutches of Marxism.” ### Unfortunately, added Pacepa, “Now, that ‘bubonic plague’ of Marxism has also infected my adoptive country, the United States.” ### And how exactly did this Marxist “infection,” which permeates most of our university campuses and is endangering America’s very existence as a free republic, and about which Pacepa and others have been urgently warning us for decades, come about? ### The history of the American left is literally a history of “Russian collusion,” from the major infiltration of Soviet agents into the U.S. government during the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg giving America’s top secret atomic weapons designs to the Soviets (at the time, only the U.S. had nuclear weapons), to the pivotal role Soviet disinformation played in turning American public opinion – and ultimately Congress – against the Vietnam War. From subversion of America’s entertainment industry (there were close to 600 communists in Hollywood alone when Reagan stood up to them as head of the Screen Actors Guild) to the awarding of New York Times’ Moscow bureau chief Walter Duranty a Pulitzer Prize for covering up Stalin’s genocidal starvation of 7 million people in Ukraine. From the creation of dozens of communist-front “antiwar” and other groups active in the U.S., to even the infiltration – as Pacepa and Rychlak document in “Disinformation” – of major Christian churches by the KGB. ### Interestingly, Pacepa added in his email: “In 2009, the U.S. got its first Marxist president, and in March 2013, the CIA got a director, John O. Brennan, who had voted the Communist ticket.” (That’s right. In the 1976 U.S. presidential election, Brennan voted for Communist Party USA candidate Gus Hall.) ### So, what does Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa, one of the world’s top experts on genuine “Russian collusion,” think about the leftist Democrats and “mainstream media” daily attacking President Donald Trump for alleged “Russian collusion”? ### The left, he said, specializes in fabricating fake news, history and reality, and always has. He recalled, thoughtfully: “In my other life as a Soviet bloc intelligence general, I had a banner posted in my DIE [Romania’s foreign intelligence service] office proclaiming in upper-case letters: ‘CAPITALIST ESPIONAGE REPORTS HISTORY. WE MAKE IT.’ Communist espionage was not designed to predict enemy intentions, as Western espionage services do. Our omniscient rulers knew best,” he said, indicating that communists prefer to rewrite and re-invent history, something the American left is notorious for doing. ### And never more ferociously than right now. ### “Now,” summarizes Pacepa, “a new generation of Democratic Party leaders who seem to have sawdust in their heads are trying to use Russia as a scarecrow in order to prevent the return of the U.S. to capitalism and freedom.” ### After all, the dream of the American left, which has for all practical purposes completely swallowed up the Democratic Party, has long been socialism – including socialized medicine and a guaranteed annual income (Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, during a recent commencement speech, urged the U.S. government to provide everyone with a “universal basic income” – cradle-to-grave security guaranteed by the state). ### But these are in no way American ideals, rooted in liberty, constitutionally limited government, Christian morality, the work ethic, and unlimited freedom and opportunity, which birthed the most prodigiously successful, powerful, generous and noble nation in history. It is, rather, the dream of communist Russia that mesmerized American leftist politicians, intellectuals, celebrities and activists for generations. Today it has metastasized throughout much of the nation, all the result of a hundred years of the American left “colluding,” on one level or another, “with the Russians.” ### It’s doubtful I could fit any more irony and absurdity into this story without it bursting at the seams, but just consider, as a postscript, that Russia is no longer communist. Remember, as an economic system Marxism/socialism doesn’t actually work, and eventually breaks down because it so profoundly and totally violates human nature, the laws of economics and the lessons of history. It always fails. Just ask oil-rich Venezuela. ### Maybe the hardcore left is angrily turning on Russia now because the motherland broke faith with their shared socialist dream. That must hurt. But America’s leftists could at least find solace in the knowledge that the glorious Union of Soviet Socialist Republics didn’t give up on socialism willingly. It died because socialism has always been dead; its “life” is just an illusion, a seduction, a con game, a temporary something-for-nothing charade, a promise of one thing that delivers another – namely totalitarianism. It’s a living death at best. Even the Russians know this now. ### Only the American left, which has spent a century lusting over a socialist utopia that can never be, still craves it. ### In the meantime, the same left that demonizes America and capitalism with arguments identical to those learned at the feet of Russian communists, continues to accuse pro-American capitalist Donald Trump of “colluding with the Russians.” ### That’s irony for you."

In the face of rising global oil prices, members of the OPEC cartel and a few non-members including Russia agreed last month to ease production caps that had contributed to the run-up in prices. ### President Donald Trump has urged the Saudis to pump more oil to contain rising prices. He tweeted on June 30 that King Salman agreed to boost production ""maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels."" The White House later clarified that the king said his country has a reserve of 2 million barrels a day that could be tapped ""if and when necessary."" ### The idea that the U.S. could ever again become the world's top oil producer once seemed preposterous. ### ""A decade ago the only question was how fast would U.S. production go down,"" said Daniel Yergin, author of several books about the oil industry including a history, ""The Prize."" The rebound of U.S. output ""has made a huge difference. If this had not happened, we would have had a severe shortage of world oil,"" he said. ### The United States led the world in oil production for much of the 20th century, but the Soviet Union surpassed America in 1974, and Saudi Arabia did the same in 1976, according to Energy Department figures. ### By the end of the 1970s the USSR was producing one-third more oil than the U.S.; by the end of the 1980s, Soviet output was nearly double that of the U.S. ### The last decade or so has seen a revolution in American energy production, however, led by techniques including hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling. ### Those innovations — and the breakup of the Soviet Union — helped the U.S. narrow the gap. Last year, Russia produced more than 10.3 million barrels a day, Saudi Arabia pumped just under 10 million, and the U.S. came in under 9.4 million barrels a day, according to U.S. government figures. ### The U.S. has been pumping more than 10 million barrels a day on average since February, and probably pumped about 10.9 million barrels a day in June, up from 10.8 million in May, the energy agency said Tuesday in its latest short-term outlook. ### According to the Energy Department, the U.S. edged ahead of Saudi Arabia in February and stayed there in March; both trailed Russia. ### Capuano's agency forecast that U.S. crude output will average 10.8 million barrels a day for all of 2018 and 11.8 million barrels a day in 2019. The current U.S. record for a full year is 9.6 million barrels a day in 1970. ### The trend of rising U.S. output prompted Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, to predict this spring that the U.S. would leapfrog Russia and become the world's largest producer by next year — if not sooner. ### One potential obstacle for U.S. drillers is a bottleneck of pipeline capacity to ship oil from the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico to ports and refineries. ### ""They are growing the production but they can't get it out of the area fast enough because of pipeline constraints,"" said Jim Rittersbusch, a consultant to oil traders. ### Some analysts believe that Permian production could decline, or at least grow more slowly, in 2019 or 2020 as energy companies move from their best acreage to more marginal areas. ### Close"

The arguments feed the Kremlin narrative that democracy is dangerous unless it is carefully “managed.” ### Russian commentators and editorialists who consider the European Union hostile, troublesome or irrelevant welcomed Trump’s criticism of longtime European allies as “foes” to the U.S. ### Russia’s state-run Channel One said Trump’s meetings in Britain and contentious appearance at the NATO summit last week were secondary to Monday’s summit, saying: “After all, he was just passing through Brussels and London on the way to Helsinki.” ### Konstantin Kosachev, head of the upper house of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, wrote in Izvestia that Monday’s talks come at a time when “so-called ‘peace-loving’ Europe is afraid of peace talks between U.S. and Russia.” ### Russian media did have rather tempered expectations of how much Putin can concretely get from the summit, but hoped for progress on solutions for Syria and Mideast tensions. ### Heading into the summit, Trump denounced the American news media as the “enemy of the people,” despite constitutional protections for freedom of the press. ### The Russian media scene is a different beast. Under Putin, the government has assumed control or sway over most broadcasters and mainstream media and put pressure on critical reporting online. Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some outspoken Russian journalists. ### A protest sign for the summit posted on a Helsinki bus stop Monday read “Unpleasant things will happen to Journalists who ask Putin questions.” ### Despite clear interest in Russia in Putin’s meeting with Trump, the summit wasn’t the No. 1 item on many Russian newscasts or websites Monday: That honor went to the World Cup, and Russia’s own global image. ### CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE ### Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Jack Keane (Ret.) on President Trump’s upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### President Trump is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland on Monday, for a summit where some key economic concerns could come into focus. ### Continue Reading Below ### From Putin’s perspective, sanction relief has been a top concern. The U.S. imposed a slew of sanctions on Moscow beginning in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. Additional sanctions were imposed after U.S. intelligence officials concluded that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election. ### In April, the Trump administration designated seven oligarchs and their 12 companies, along with 17 senior Russian government officials for engaging “in a range of malign activity around the globe.” The world’s second largest aluminum company, Rusal, was among the companies sanctioned at that time. Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska—who is also sanctioned – stepped down as director of Rusal and agreed to reduce his stake in the company in an effort to get the sanctions against the aluminum giant lifted. ### While experts are not necessarily expecting any change in sanction policy to come out of this summit, discussions could pave the way for future negotiations. ### On behalf of the U.S., Trump could ask for Putin’s help in the effort to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. For the most part, Moscow has refused to go along with global measures to put an economic squeeze on the rogue nation. ### While China has by far the most economic influence over Pyongyang, Russia’s compliance with the international effort would be beneficial. Russia is one of the top countries where North Korea imports goods from, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity. Russia was also believed to have been helping North Korea ship coal last year, in violation of United Nations sanctions. Coal exports from Pyongyang have been banned since August 2017 in an effort to cut funding for the country’s nuclear program. ### URL"

And it really hurts our relationship with Russia. ### CHUCK TODD: ### And still looks forward meeting tomorrow with Vladimir Putin. ### DONALD TRUMP: ### I think that we would have a chance to have a very good relationship with Russia. ### CHUCK TODD: ### advertisement ### The question, is this the right time to hold a summit with Putin? My guests this morning: The U.S. ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, Democratic senator Mark Warner of Virginia, and Republican senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska. Plus, confronting allies. President Trump threatens NATO, takes on Theresa May on Brexit, and praises her rival. ### DONALD TRUMP: ### I also told Theresa May how to do it, but she didn't agree-- she didn't listen to me. ### CHUCK TODD: ### And the GOP versus the F.B.I. Republicans in Congress charge F.B.I. agent Peter Strzok with bias against President Trump in the Russia investigation. ### REP. TREY GOWDY: ### That is bias. Agent Strzok may not see it, but see it, but the rest of the country does. ### CHUCK TODD: ### I strongly believe today's hearing is just another victory notch in Putin's belt and another milestone in our enemy's campaign to tear America apart. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Joining me for insight and analysis are Amy Walter, national editor for the Cook Political Report, Hugh Hewitt, host on the Salem Radio Network, NBC News political analyst Elise Jordan, and Joshua Johnson, host of 1A on NPR. Welcome to Sunday. It's Meet the Press. ### MALE VOICEOVER: ### From NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history. This is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Good Sunday morning. Well, it turns out it wasn't somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds. Even before Friday's indictments of 12 Russian intelligence operatives for hacking the Democrats during the 2016 campaign, four U.S. intelligence agencies had already weighed in. The F.B.I., the C.I.A., the D.N.I. and the N.S.A., all of them had concluded that Russians interfered in the 2016 election and they did so with the goal of helping Donald Trump. ### In fact, you can view the Russian hacking of Democratic emails, opposition research, turnout models as the Watergate burglary of the 2016 election, the political crime of the 21st century. Now, as in 1972, the central crime is the penetration of the DNC by hostile actors. Then, the hostile actor was the Nixon White House. Now, it's the Russian government. ### And, as in 1972, the White House, this one was quick to distance itself from this crime. The Trump White House quickly put out a statement pointing out that there were, quote, ""No allegations of knowing involvement by anyone on the Trump campaign."" That's true at least for now in this indictment. What President Trump didn't do was express outrage over the Russian hacking. ### What he did do was to reaffirm his claim that the Mueller investigation is a witch hunt and tweet that the Russian criminality took place during the Obama administration and that it failed to respond. What the President didn't do was postpone his summit on Monday with Vladimir Putin. What he did do was signal perhaps that he trusts Putin's denials over the findings of his intelligence agencies and his Justice Department, leaving much of the world asking why. ### I think I'd have a very good relationship with President Putin if we spent time together. ### CHUCK TODD: ### The indictment of 12 Russian military officers just three days before Monday's one-on-one meeting is the most detailed account yet of Russia's attack on America's democracy. ### ROD ROSENSTEIN: ### I briefed President Trump about these allegations earlier this week. We need to work together to hold the perpetrators accountable. ### CHUCK TODD: ### But despite that briefing, Mr. Trump spent the week praising Putin-- ### DONALD TRUMP: ### He's not my enemy. Hopefully someday maybe he'll be a friend. ### CHUCK TODD: ### --rattling the alliance established to contain Soviet and now Russian aggression, NATO, insulting the British prime minister on her Brexit strategy in a British newspaper-- ### DONALD TRUMP: ### I would have done it much differently. She didn't listen to me. ### CHUCK TODD: ### --and most notably attacking his own Justice Department and the special counsel probe tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. ### DONALD TRUMP: ### I call it the rigged witch hunt. I think that really hurts our country. And it really hurts our relationship with Russia. ### CHUCK TODD: ### The indictment fills in the gaps of several extraordinary moments in the summer of 2016 and raises questions about the Trump campaign's role in the attack on the United States by a foreign power. First, there's the infamous Trump Tower meeting. June 3rd, Donald Trump Jr. is promised dirt on Hillary Clinton through a Kremlin intermediary, replying, ""If it's what you say, I love it. Especially later in the summer."" ### June 8th, the indictment says Russian intelligence officers launch DCLeaks.com and begin to release stolen DNC emails. A day later, Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort meet in Trump Tower with Russians tied to the Kremlin. Second, the indictment reveals that on July 27th Russian hackers tried for the first time to hack into servers in Clinton's personal campaign office. It is the same day Mr. Trump said this about Clinton's emails. ### DONALD TRUMP: ### Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Mr. Trump has consistently questioned the conclusion of his own intelligence agencies. ### DONALD TRUMP: ### President Putin really feels and he feels strongly that he did not meddle in our election. ### CHUCK TODD: ### He has even denied the hacking of the DNC and Clinton's campaign occurred. ### DONALD TRUMP: ### She doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay? ### CHUCK TODD: ### Though Mr. Trump says he will bring up hacking with Putin in their Monday meeting, on Friday he was dismissive. ### DONALD TRUMP: ### I don't think you'll have any, ""Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me."" There won't be a Perry Mason here I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? ### CHUCK TODD:And joining me now from Helsinki, the site of the Trump-Putin summit, is the U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman. Ambassador Huntsman, welcome back to Meet the Press, sir. AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN:Thank you, Chuck. CHUCK TODD:Let me start with a simple question. Is this summit still on? And if so, why? AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN:Well, listen, and it isn't a summit. I've heard it called a summit. This is a meeting. In fact, it's the first meeting between the two presidents. They've had some pull-asides, one at the G20 in Hamburg and the other at the APEC Ministerial in Da Nang, Vietnam, but this is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation. And I hope it's a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests. This has not happened before, so there's a lot in our agenda that's been built over now many years of a relationship that is terribly fraught. So, yes, it will happen, and it should happen. CHUCK TODD:You, obviously, are making a distinction between a summit and a meeting. Is this because we don't have an agenda or we don't have deliverables? Because one of the things you said before in preparation is if you have a summit, you have to have an agenda and you have to have deliverables. Does that mean we're not going to have a deliverable out of this? AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN:Well, listen, Chuck, you've been around for presidential summits. I've been around since Reagan's visit to China in the early 1980s. No state dinner, no joint statement, no deliverables that are going to be pre-packaged. You don't know what's going to come out of this meeting, but what it will be is the first opportunity for these presidents to actually sit down across a table, alone and then with their teams, to talk about everything from meddling in the election, to areas where we have some shared interests. You've got to remember, Chuck, that Russia is a country of 11 time zones. It touches Asia, it touches the Middle East, it touches western Europe. And it's inconceivable that we can solve some of the international issues without engaging Russia at some level. Now, right now, there's no trust in the relationship. And because of that, problem solving is practically impossible. So, this is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama, and quite frankly some of the danger, out of the relationship right now. CHUCK TODD:How did the indictments of 12 Russian military officers on Friday change the agenda? AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN:Well, I don't think the details are a surprise to folks who have followed this. That now makes probably almost 30 Russians who have been rolled up by the Mueller indictment. That investigation continues. And I think the bigger picture is we need to hold the Russians accountable for what they did, their malign activity throughout Europe as well. That's a part of the conversation that needs to take place. And again, Chuck, this is why it's so important to get our senior leaders together, because these conversations have happened at the local level. I'm on the ground. I'm on the front lines in Moscow. They happened at our level, but they haven't happened at the senior-most levels in the detail that we're likely to get tomorrow. That's why this gathering is important for, for one reason. CHUCK TODD:Two things, will the president ask Putin to extradite the 12 Russian military officers? And have you formally requested that the Russian government do this? We don't have an extradition treaty, so we have to make a formal request. Have you already begun that paperwork? AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN:Well, the F.B.I. office in the embassy no doubt is -- will work on that. I can't disclose any details in that regard. Requests can be made. That doesn't necessarily mean that the Russians are going to follow through with it. But we'll see if those steps will be taken. I can't make any announcement right here with you. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Is the president going to make the ask or not? ### AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN: ### I don't know if he'll make the ask, but it may be part of the agenda. It may be part of their bilateral meeting together. We'll have to see. It just came onto the agenda last Friday, so it's something that's brand new. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Why does it matter so much that the president have a warm relationship with Putin, whether you want to call it a friendship or not? He’s undertaken -- this is Putin's actions, they're pretty outrageous, annexing Crimea, intervening in Syria to prop up a brutal dictator, interfering in our elections, and by the way, poisoning British citizens just recently in the U.K. And yet we're bending over backwards, it looks like. The appearance is we're bending over backwards in order to have a relationship with Putin right now. Why? ### AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN: ### Well, Chuck, you just started that long litany, that long list of grievances, and it goes on much longer than that. You have to remember there's a reason why every president in the post-Cold War period has tried to engage China, every president. And it has started a boom and a bust cycle that has left both sides dejected, angry at each other, finger pointing. And it's because we set expectations way too high. We have-- ### (OVERTALK) ### Ambassador, let me pause you there. You said China. I assume you're referring to Russia? ### AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN: ### I'm sorry, of course I'm referring to Russia. ### CHUCK TODD: ### That's what I thought. You're obviously a former ambassador to China. Understandable. Go ahead, sir. ### AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN: ### I'm sorry, Chuck. The redos and the resets, which have largely collapsed. So, the, the objective here is to meet, to put our cards on the table. There isn't a thought that there would be a reset or a redo. We've looked at past history. We have interests, they have interests, and it's a function of seeing where some of those interests overlap. Now, they will overlap in the area of strategic stability and arms control, where we have a very important arms control agreement that is coming due in 2021. Russia's in violation of the INF Treaty. That's got to be talked about. You've got some overlapping interests in Syria, where we've come very close to confrontation. We've got some shared interests with respect to the Korean peninsula, where we both believe in a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, a strong northeast Asia, and non-proliferation. So, all of these are areas where conceivably we can strike up a conversation, but we have to remember that -- let history be our guide. These redos and these resets, they only get you so far, usually end in failure. We've got to put our cards on the table. We have to remember and recognize some of the malign activity that we have been through and approach this with our eyes wide open. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Let me ask you this. Does the president buy into the national security strategy assessment that was written in December of 2017? And it read as follows, ""China and Russia are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence."" Does the president buy into this? ### AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN: ### Well, it's his team's document. I certainly assume so. And what you've just described, I can't imagine anyone would disagree with that assessment with either China or Russia. ### CHUCK TODD: ### On the issue of Crimea, can you say in no uncertain terms that the president is going to stick to what -- to the piece of paper he signed in Brussels with the NATO -- with the fellow NATO leaders when he said that was never, you know, nothing, nothing changes when it comes to Crimea? Is the president going to, sort of, stick -- stick to his belief that -- or stick to the belief of NATO nations that Crimea belongs to Ukraine and not Russia? ### AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN: ### The agenda is the president's. Everything will be his call, but I think it's highly unlikely that you'll see any change in Crimea. This was a violation of international law. What we've seen in Eastern Ukraine is a violation of international law, an ongoing conflict. And Donbass, the two so-called breakaway republics, we have some very real issues. This is not a-- ### (OVERTALK) ### But you didn't rule it out. ### AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN: ### --conflict, Chuck. This is-- ### CHUCK TODD: ### Ambassador, I noticed you didn't rule it out. You said that it's the president's call. So, he could very well just sort of say-- ### AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN: ### Well, of course it's the president’s call. ### CHUCK TODD: ### --""You know what, even though everybody else doesn't think it's a good idea."" ### AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN: ### Of course it's the president's call, but I think it's highly unlikely that that's going to emerge in their conversation, as you suggest. There's a lot more to talk about, strategic stability, Syria, Ukraine, D.P.R.K., our bilateral relationship. We've got a fraught bilateral relationship. The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off the charts high. So, it's a good thing these presidents are getting together. ### CHUCK TODD: ### All right. Ambassador Huntsman, I'm going to have to leave it there. I appreciate you doing this interview outside. I know that wasn't an easy thing in Helsinki. Appreciate it. ### AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN: ### AMBASSADOR JON HUNTSMAN: ### Thank you very much. ### CHUCK TODD:And joining me now is Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. He, of course, is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is doing its own investigation into the Russian interference. Senator Warner, welcome back to Meet the Press. SENATOR MARK WARNER:Thank you, Chuck. CHUCK TODD:You just heard from Ambassador Huntsman. You are signed onto a letter with a bunch of other Democratic senators calling for the president to either cancel the summit, or if he doesn't, basically essentially make it a one-issue summit. Ambassador Huntsman, number one, doesn't want to call it a summit, a meeting. Have you been reassured by what you heard from Ambassador Huntsman about what the president will do with Putin? SENATOR MARK WARNER:Well, Chuck, I'd feel a lot better if Ambassador Huntsman, who I have a lot of confidence in, was actually sitting in on the meeting. I'm very concerned about a one-on-one meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. We know that Trump doesn't do a lot of prep work for these meetings. He kind of goes in and wings it. We saw what happened when he did that with Kim Jong-Un. He ended up saying everything is okay with North Korea, and frankly we've found, since that time, that's not the case. In Putin, you've got a trained K.G.B. agent who does his homework. My fear is that Putin could come in with maps of Ukraine or maps of Syria and try to cut some deal, and frankly, take advantage of this president. So, I really would feel much better if there were other Americans in the room making sure that we make the point that the first and top point of this agenda should be no further Russian interference in our elections. CHUCK TODD:All right, I understand you don't want the president to do this one-on-one, but let me ask you this. Shouldn’t-- let me pick up on a point that Ambassador Huntsman kept making. What's wrong with the two leaders meeting? Yes, we should-- we have some contentious issues to discuss, but regardless of your personal views of President Trump, what's wrong with this meeting? SENATOR MARK WARNER:Listen, the idea that two leaders of two great nations are meeting absolutely makes sense, but what we have now, which was unprecedented, is Russian intervention in our elections, where they hacked into Democrats' and Democratic officials' emails, released them to benefit Trump and hurt Clinton, where they intervened in over 20 states' electoral systems, where they used social media in ways that were unprecedented. And if an American leader and an American administration wouldn't start a meeting with the head of the country that did that intervention and make that the top priority, then this meeting really shouldn't take place. Remember, Russia massively intervened. They are an adversary. And my fear is this president, in particular, has been really reluctant to call out that activity, has been completely reluctant to call out Putin as a bad actor. And that's why we need to make sure there are at least other people in the room. CHUCK TODD:Let me ask you, though, about Russia policy. You know, the Trump administration has been tough on Russia. President Trump rhetorically has not. Why does that matter? SENATOR MARK WARNER:Chuck, Chuck, the-- Chuck, the, the president rhetorically has not been tough on Russia. As a matter of fact, Congress had to take an unprecedented action basically and say, ""Hey, when we say sanctions, we mean you've got to actually put those sanctions in place."" Trump drug his feet on imposing the sanctions. We had to pass legislation that frankly boxed the president in so we would avoid taking that responsibility. CHUCK TODD:I want to get into the indictment. Number one, the timing of the indictment on Friday. Do you get the sense that the Justice Department was trying to send a message? SENATOR MARK WARNER:You know, I had no idea when the indictment was going to come and we're still processing. And first of all, we should say there's an awful lot of very good work done here to have this level of specificity in terms of these Russian spies and how they acted and what they did specifically. We now have the Mueller investigation with over 30 indictments, with five guilty pleas, and who knows what next is to come because clearly, with the number of individuals that have said they're cooperating with the Mueller investigation, I'm sure he's got more to come. CHUCK TODD:I want to know actually what you'd learned new, and you said you learned a lot new in this. And one of the things I want to ask you about is, in the indictment, we learned that on the same day, on or about July 27th, that these Russian intelligence agents attempted after hours to spearfish for the first time emails associated with Clinton's personal office and the Clinton campaign. And this happened on the day of this infamous sound bite from then-candidate Donald Trump, July 27th, 2016. ### [BEGIN TAPE] ### PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: ### Russia if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. ### [END TAPE] ### Was this a new piece of evidence to you, Senator Warner? ### SENATOR MARK WARNER: ### Well, it appears a rather strange coincidence that the very day that Mr. Trump calls on the Russians to hack into Clinton emails, well, the Russian spies actually try to take that action. And remember, that, that call for the Russians to act came a few weeks after Donald Trump, Jr., his son, his son-in-law, his campaign manager, had all sat down with Russian agents in the Trump Tower, where the Russian agents had offered dirt on Hillary Clinton. Clearly, you take that, you take the efforts to reach out to Trump aide, Mr. Papadopoulos, where Russians were offering dirt, there is a pattern of behavior here that I think, at the end of the day, I hope Mueller gets to the bottom of. ### CHUCK TODD: ### All right, you brought up the Trump Tower meeting. In fact, we learned about a new piece of, of the timeline in the Trump Tower meeting. In between when the meeting happened and when it was set up, the Russian operatives set up a website called DCLeaks.com, literally the day before the Trump Tower meeting. Perhaps that was a way of a proof of what they had to the folks they were meeting there. Is all of this, July 27th and the Trump Tower meeting, and what we've learned now, is that circumstantial evidence of collusion? ### SENATOR MARK WARNER: ### Again, I'm going to leave those conclusions to the public, leave those conclusions to seeing what else Mueller has in terms of this investigation -- ### CHUCK TODD: ### What about you? Does that look like collusion to you? ### SENATOR MARK WARNER: ### And frankly -- what I'm saying, Chuck, is we've got further witnesses we're going to interview. And one thing we do know, just within the public domain, clearly there were a lot of folks affiliated with the Russian government reaching out to a whole series of folks within the Trump orbit, trying to offer information to -- discriminating and bad information about Clinton. And again, just based upon Donald Trump Jr.'s response, where he said he was pretty anxious to get that kind of information. ### CHUCK TODD: ### It, you know, reading the indictment and realizing this was more than just the stealing of emails, it was the stealing of voter files and things like that, the now October 7th, frankly what has been told to me was a watered down warning to the American public about Russian interference, but that October 2016 assessment now looks awfully, awfully weak. Obviously, in hindsight, this looks weak. What should the Obama administration have done that they didn't do then? ### SENATOR MARK WARNER: ### Well, Chuck, our committee is going to go -- and it’s going through the final stages of a thorough review of what both the Obama administration, and for that matter the F.B.I., did right, did wrong. I think history will show we should have sounded a much stronger alarm. But let's also take the fact, you mentioned, Chuck, the election interference. In a regular or normal administration, when we see that a foreign government had tried to intervene in more than 20 states' electoral systems, and when the current director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, has said the Russians will be back, in a normal administration you would have had a White House designate someone in that White House to make sure election security was a top priority. Again, we've had this administration not step up. The Congress has. Our committee has. And we've put some funds out, we've put some bipartisan legislation out, but I think it's abysmal that this administration has not made 2018 election security a higher priority. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Do you believe the 2018 elections are going to be fair? ### SENATOR MARK WARNER: ### I hope they are, but I tell you, I feel - I would feel a lot better if there was a concerted, whole-of-government effort to make sure not only at the state and local registrar level, but on the companies that manipulate and own the voter files and maintain the voter files behind the scenes. I think we need to really step up our game. ### CHUCK TODD: ### All right. Senator Mark Warner, the vice-chair of the Intel Committee in the Senate, Democrat from Virginia. Thanks for coming on and sharing your views, sir. ### SENATOR MARK WARNER: ### Thank you, Chuck. ### CHUCK TODD: ### When we come back, given what we've learned in those indictments about Russian meddling, should President Trump have postponed his summit with Vladimir Putin? The panel will chew on that next. ### (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ### CHUCK TODD: And we are back. Panel is here. Joshua Johnson, host of NPR's 1A and now an NBC News contributor. Amy Walter, national editor for the Cook Political Report. NBC News political analyst Elise Jordan. And Hugh Hewitt, host on the Salem Radio Network, excuse me, and an NBC News contributor. All right. I want to start the conversation for you guys off with just this Susan Glasser nugget from The New Yorker on Friday. ""Most experts I spoke with,"" she writes, ""Republican and Democrat alike, were resigned to Trump being outplayed by Putin, a view perhaps best summed up by a former State Department official. 'I'm afraid,' he told me, 'that our guy here is like an amateur boxer going up against Muhammad Ali.'"" Amy? ### AMY WALTER: Well, we already heard from the ambassador that it's just a meeting. So it's not a summit. ### CHUCK TODD: Hang on. We went from summit to meeting. At some point he went down to detailed conversation. ### AMY WALTER: Right. So already we know where this is. And let's face it. Putin has already won. It's not simply that the president's going over into his part of the world and having the sit-down, a one-on-one. But the fact is that after these indictments what a president should be saying to everyone, not just to Putin but to the American public writ large, ""Russia did this to divide us. Russia didn't do this simply to make sure somebody won and somebody lost. They did this to make sure that we lose trust in our political system and in our institutions. And that's not going to happen. We are America. We may be of different parties. We may have different views. But we are united in America. And that's what I'm going to go say to Vladimir Putin, that, 'You cannot divide us.'"" And he can't do that. ### CHUCK TODD: Hugh, why can't he? ### HUGH HEWITT: I think he will. I actually have much more confidence in the president probably than anyone at this table because I take a long view. There have been 26 Soviet-American summits, six Russian-American summits. ### CHUCK TODD: Don't call it a summit. ### HUGH HEWITT: I know. But call it whatever you want. The worst was Vienna in '61. But the second worst was President Obama in Seoul with Medvedev on the open mic in March of 2012 when he said, ""Tell Vlad give me some space."" What happened after that? Snowden, Crimea, the fraught relationship the ambassador just referred to. We won't know for a year how this plays out. And I actually have much more confidence that Donald Trump will not be bullied and will not be seeking the approval of anyone because he doesn't seek the approval of anyone ever. ### CHUCK TODD: Elise, do you buy that? ### ELISE JORDAN: But you could argue that the preconditions though that President Obama set up for Putin to feel empowered is exactly what Donald Trump is doing though by going into this meeting on Monday. You look at how Donald Trump's theatrics before the meeting with Kim Jong-un and how he threatened to-- you know, he canceled it. It was back on. And he definitely had the North Koreans sitting on the edge of their seat about would Donald Trump lend them that prestige by going to the table. Here, Donald Trump is forcing the issue against all of his top advisors. He's wanted to have this summit. They've tried to dissuade him. And there hasn't even been a principals committee meeting, as Susan Glasser reports in The New Yorker, to discuss what's on the agenda with Russia. So I just don't see how we can expect anything to come out of this and why Donald Trump is forcing the issue so much. ### JOSHUA JOHNSON: I think about that quote from Michelangelo that our greatest danger may not be that we aim too high and we miss but that we aim too low and we hit. Ambassador Huntsman may not be calling this a summit, but I just checked the homepages of Sputnik News and RT, and both of them do. So the Russians may be viewing this the way the world views this. With a little bit more alacrity. The president may be going into this to get what he wants. And he may very well get it. He may just want this meeting to be a getting-to-know-you meeting. ""We need to spend time with people who could possibly be our allies and our friends."" And he may walk out of there getting everything he wants. And so might Vladimir Putin. Granted, it may not be as visible as the North Korea meeting where the world saw an image of them shaking hands. But I wonder if the larger risk is that both men could walk into the meeting, get what they wanted, and walk out thinking they're both winners. ### CHUCK TODD: I'm sorry. This is what the president's director of national intelligence said on Friday about Russia. Take a listen. ### DANIEL COATS (Tape): We know you run the shop. We know you're making the decisions. You can't pass it off to, ""Oh, that's some hacker down somewhere where we don't know."" We know what you do. ### CHUCK TODD: (UNINTEL) he said a blinking red light, essentially comparing to it right before 9/11. So the president's going to sit down and try to befriend somebody who Director Coats says is currently attacking the United States? ### AMY WALTER: Well, and framing it like this, the way that the president has, 1) ""Putin's not going to admit it. So why should I even ask him?"" And, 2) ""It happened under Obama's watch."" Now, both of those things are true, but that's not the point. The point is not to say, ""Well, did you do it?"" and then have him say, ""Of course not. We don't do anything. We don't spy."" It's to say, ""We know you did it. Look at how detailed. We know you do it. We know the names of people who are doing it."" ### HUGH HEWITT: We know they've been doing it. I was reminded last night at dinner by two veterans of the IC, 40 years ago anniversary the Russians executed Georgi Markov in London with a ricin-tipped umbrella. They are the Russians. They have been the Russians since Stalin. They are the same people year in and year out. And Romney was right in 2012. I just think that the American media is trying to infuse Donald Trump with a sort of willful blindness that he doesn't demonstrate. ### CHUCK TODD: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you-- wait. What the heck are you talking about with ""media""? This is not media. This is John McCain. ### (OVERTALK) ### CHUCK TODD: This is actual -- This is Mark Warner. These are serious officials on both sides of the aisle. The is not the media. ### HUGH HEWITT: The commentary around the summit-- ### CHUCK TODD: That's such a copout. ### HUGH HEWITT: No, no. The commentary around this summit-- ### (OVERTALK) ### CHUCK TODD: I'm getting tired of that-- ### HUGH HEWITT:--tries to make-- ### CHUCK TODD: --claptrap. ### HUGH HEWITT: --Trump appear to be unprepared for this when he's got Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, Jim Mattis, the best national security team-- ### CHUCK TODD: It's not the media-- ### HUGH HEWITT: --assembled in decades. ### CHUCK TODD: It's not the media that's saying this. ### ELISE JORDAN: They haven't prepared though. ### CHUCK TODD: It's our own reporting. ### ELISE JORDAN: The only preparation is-- ### CHUCK TODD: It's people inside the White House saying it, Hugh. ### ELISE JORDAN: The only preparation has been John Bolton going over last week and pursuing a policy that is completely the opposite of what John Bolton has espoused his entire career. ### AMY WALTER: Plus, this is the point, is that it's one thing to do the spying and all the other things that Russia has been doing. But, again, when it is turning Americans against Americans. And that was their point, is for Americans to not trust not just the political parties and the political institutions. But not to trust the F.B.I. and any other institution. That to me is more worrisome. ### JOSHUA JOHNSON: And we can point out one piece of this report that you and I were talking about before the show? It also notes that among the things the Russians did was mining for Bitcoin. Now, Bitcoin gets complicated. But basically what that does is you have a computer system that does incredibly complicated computations. And by completing them, the system allows you to generate more Bitcoin, which means the Russians generated money to make this happen. They literally minted money to hack our election system. Now, the president saying, ""Well, I don't know if I'm going to ask for extradition” is stunning. If someone broke into the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and stole American dollars to commit a crime against the United States, it would be an immediate call for extradition. They are literally-- ### HUGH HEWITT: Josh, there is no surprise-- ### JOSHUA JOHNSON: --making money. ### HUGH HEWITT: --in this. I'm just saying the Russians have been the Russians, are the Russians, will be the Russians. And everybody knows it. And we should not downplay the fact that Trump knows it, too. ### JOSHUA JOHNSON: And the president is not categorical in saying that he will ask the Russians to extradite these men. He won't even say it. That alone is a gigantic concern, that he won't stand up and say, ""My government is accusing you of committing a crime against our democracy. You have to act, or I will."" ### ELISE JORDAN: Well, but I think Hugh's point is an important one. We should learn from the past. President Trump should learn from what happened with President Obama, what happened with President Bush. And he's not. And so advocates of Trump's foreign policy saying it's good that he's going and shaking things up in NATO and going against the grain, well, then why do we support what he's doing with Russia when it's failed in the past? ### CHUCK TODD: All right. Got to make that the last point. I promise you guys get to come back here. But when we come back, I want to talk to some elected Republicans about this. Do Republicans think President Trump is right to go ahead with the Putin summit? Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska is next. Stick with us. ### (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ### CHUCK TODD: ### Welcome back. While some Republicans like Senator John McCain have urged President Trump to use the Russia indictments to get tougher with Vladimir Putin or simply cancel tomorrow's summit, the Republican leadership in Congress has been largely silent. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far provided no public reaction to the indictments from Friday. And House Speaker Paul Ryan did release this statement, saying, quote, ""We've said all along we know Russia meddled in our elections. And we're glad these hackers are being held to account."" Well, joining me now is Republican Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska. Probably physically the closest state-- ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### We certainly are, Chuck. Absolutely. ### CHUCK TODD: ### --to the country of Russia. Let me-- ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### And, by the way, they're doing a lot in the Arctic, too. Aggressively moving in the Arctic. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Let me play something for you from a colleague of yours on Thursday. Republican colleague Cory Gardner. Here's what he said about Russia. ### [BEGIN TAPE] ### SEN. CORY GARDNER: ### I think we should name Russia a state sponsor of terror. I've been on the record saying that Russia should be a state sponsor of terror. ### [END TAPE] ### CHUCK TODD: ### He said this before the indictments came out. The indictments come out Friday. Do you agree with him? ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### Well, look, I think Russia's clearly an adversary. And it's something -- it’s a country we need to take aggressive action towards. The one issue you actually mentioned in the previous segment and it doesn't get a lot of press. There is a lot of discussion on how the president seems to downplay issues with Putin. But what doesn't get a lot of discussion is the concrete actions we, the Congress, and the White House have been taking with regard to Russia. There's a number of them. We're rebuilding our military. Which we, you know, defense spending actually declined almost 25% from 2010 to 2016. That rebuilding includes the European reassurance initiative. Billions of dollars for our troops in Poland and the Baltics. Boots on the ground. Second, you know, this administration has given lethal weapons, the Javelin anti-tank system, to Ukraine. President Obama never did that. Congress -- bipartisan members of the Senate Armed Services Committee wanted to do that. We're finally doing that now. That's serious. Putin acknowledged-- ### CHUCK TODD: ### You realize though, senator, everything you're discussing you guys have forced him to do. You have forced the administration on this. He himself, though rhetorically, seems to-- when he rhetorically downplays this concrete action that you're talking about, doesn't it undermine the action? ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### Well, look, the Javelin system, for example, wasn't forced on the president at all, right? President Obama didn't want to do that. President Trump and Secretary Mattis did that. That - Putin understands power. And let me just mention one other area. Energy. Chuck, we have this great opportunity unleashing American energy. I was in a meeting with Senator McCain about a year and a half ago with a senior Russian dissident. At the end of the meeting, I asked him, ""What more can we do to push back on Putin?"" He said, ""The number one thing you Americans can do is produce more American energy."" We're doing that in Alaska with the opening of ANWR L&G (PH). So we're doing a lot. And it's the White House and the Congress together. These are concrete actions that Putin understands. To your point on the, on the rhetoric, you know, I think that actions speak louder than words, particularly as it relates to Vladimir Putin. And hopefully when the president meets him, they're going to be able to talk - these concrete actions that were taken. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Yeah. I know you're close to Senator McCain. ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### I am. ### CHUCK TODD: ### He basically says, ""If you're not going to stand up for this, cancel this meeting."" What do you make of that? ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### Look, I think we should go into the - I, I think we should still have the meeting. And I don't think even Senator McCain, you know, said that-- ### (OVERTALK) ### CHUCK TODD: ### And what should be the agen - what should be the agenda? We know there may not be one. But what should it be in your mind? ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### The agenda should be I think, number one, that we should let Vladimir Putin - the president, and his team should let Vladimir Putin know, ""If you want a better relationship, if you want, for example, sanctions to be lifted, it's going to be up to you.” What do I mean by that? Don't invade your neighbors. And move out of the countries that you've invaded. Don't align yourself with the world's biggest sponsors of state terrorism in terms of Iran. Don't back regimes like Bashar al-Assad. And certainly don't meddle in the elections of democracies like the United States--"" ### CHUCK TODD: ### So what you're saying is you don't-- ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### --""and our allies."" But absolutely. That should be the condition. Everybody's talking about, ""We need a better relationship. Putin wants a better relationship."" My view is it's up to the Russians. Because they need to take actions to get that better relationship. ### CHUCK TODD: ### You're basically saying President Trump better not give in to any of Putin's asks. Putin may ask to get American troops out of Syria. Putin may ask to lessen the sanctions due to Crimea. Putin may ask to lessen some of the sanctions and give back these - these compounds that we took away. So if the president gives in on any of those things, what are you going to do? ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### If the president is giving in on lifting sanctions without Putin taking action, I think that would be a mistake. Now, the president has also mentioned other areas. You saw Ambassador Huntsman talk about other areas of possible cooperation. One that the president highlighted in his press conference with Theresa May was on nuclear proliferation. I mean, I think if we can make progress on nuclear proliferation, which I think right now the weapons of mass destruction proliferation threat is very significant. Getting Russian cooperation on that would be important. So, there are things outside of the direct relationship. But if he wants a better relationship, particularly Putin wants the lifting of sanctions, he's got to take actions to make that happen. ### CHUCK TODD: ### I want to get you to comment on something that somebody who I believe was a colleague of yours when you were at the State Department, Nick Burns. ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### I think you know him well. ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: I know Nick Burns well... ### (OVERTALK) ### CHUCK TODD: ### He was an undersecretary during the Bush years just like you. And this is what he tweeted this week: ""Trump's trip to Europe is the single most chaotic and destructive of an American president. He has put us at odds with the E.U., weakened NATO, disparaged Germany, and directly undermined May,"" referring to Theresa May. ""He is a wrecking ball. American credibility has been diminished."" Do you agree with him? ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### Look, I - I have a lot of respect for Nick Burns. The one thing I would say, and I've said to this administration from the president on down, our most important strategic advantage in the world is that we're an ally-rich nation and our adversaries like China, Russia, North Korea, Iran are ally poor. They know that. And they've tried for decades to undermine our alliance. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Why is the president helping? ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### Well, look, I think the NATO summit actually turned out pretty well. There's always drama that comes into these summits. I helped President Bush prepare for some of his summits. There's always drama. But at the end of the day, I think actually that summit turned out well. You had the president fully re-committing to our focus on NATO. Very importantly we made progress on the 2% GDP spending, which, you know, a couple years ago most countries were actually-- ### CHUCK TODD: ### All right. ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### --reverse or declining their defense spending, including us. And then even the president raising this issue of energy in Germany and Russia was important. So I think overall it was a successful summit. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Senator Sullivan, I appreciate you coming on, sharing your views. Sounds like you are taking the president's signature at his word. Not necessarily his rhetoric. ### SEN. DAN SULLIVAN: ### Well, I like actions more than words. And I think on that front-- ### (OVERTALK) ### --Russia's listening. And um, but we got a lot of work to do. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Thanks, Chuck. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Thank you very much. Later, with the panel and end game, President Trump confronts NATO. And that wild hearing with House Republicans and F.B.I. agent Peter Strzok. But when we come back, an all-star data download. Literally. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Welcome back. Data Download time. A pretty special one this week. We've got a GRAND SLAM for you from Nationals Park right here in Washington, D.C., home to this year's this Major League Baseball All-Star Game on Tuesday night. The last time Washington got to host baseball's midsummer classic, the year was 1969. And, wow, America was a different place. So was America's pastime. ### Just think about how much more diverse baseball has become. In 1969, 74% of Major League Baseball players were white, 15% African American, just 11% Latino. This according to baseball researchers Mark Armour and Dan Levitt. Well, in 2017 the player census read this way. 63% white. Just 6% African American. Obviously that's down from '69. But nearly 30% Latino. Obviously players from countries like the Dominican Republic in particular and Venezuela have driven a lot of this change in the game. And of course this trend also reflects the growing Latino population right here in the United States. ### And as the country's population has moved towards both the South and the West, again, baseball has followed suit. Believe it or not, in 1969 there had never been a major league team in the states of Florida, Arizona, or Colorado. And that year there was just one team in Texas, the Houston Colt 45s-turned-Astros. But if you build it or if you move there, they will come. Now, we've got the Miami Marlins, Tampa Bay Rays, a second team in Texas, Texas Rangers, Colorado Rockies, and the Arizona Diamondbacks. All as the populations of these states have obviously grown rapidly. ### Now, regrettably taking your family out to the ball game is a bit more expensive today than it was in 1969. Back then you could get a lower-level ticket to the All-Star Game for just 12 bucks. In today's dollars, by the way, adjusted for inflation that price would be $82. Well, guess what? This year, that lower-level ticket is going to run you about $350 face value. I'm not talking behind home plate by the way. ### And even though baseball attendance has ticked down slightly the last few years, it's a pretty good news story over a generation. We've still got more than double the amount of fans showing up for games today than in 1969. An average of nearly 14,000 per game back then and an average of just over 28,000 today. And finally, who's most likely to be tuning in to the game Tuesday night? ### Well, it wouldn't be D.C. if we didn't slide some politics in. Our friends at Simmons Research found that 35% of Republicans say they're interested in Major League Baseball. It's a slight edge over both Democrats and Independents, who both clock in at 29% each showing high interest in baseball. But even in this politically divided town, there's going to be one thing we all agree on this week. We're going to root for the home team. Let's go, Nats. And root for the home league. Let's go, National League. Coming up, back to the studio with the panel and end game. ### MALE VOICEOVER: ### Coming up, end game and postgame brought to you by Boeing. Continuing our mission to connect, protect, explore, and inspire. ### MALE VOICEOVER: ### End game, brought to you by Boeing. Continuing our mission to connect, protect, explore, and inspire. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Whew. Back now for end game. No traffic this morning coming from Nationals Park to here. It was great. Look, I want to get back to the investigation and something Rod Rosenstein said that to me was hinting at more to come and more divisiveness to come. Take a listen. ### ROD ROSENSTEIN: ### It's important for us to avoid thinking politically as Republicans or Democrats and instead to think patriotically as Americans. The blame for election interference belongs to the criminals who committed election interference. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Good luck with that. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Yeah. Look, we know that the Americans - that the potential for indictments of actual Americans are coming. And that sounded to me like a man very worried about where this is headed. ### AMY WALTER: ### Look, we don't know where this is going. Neither do most Americans. And so what we're filling in with the gaps we don't know is our partisanship, right? If you like the president, you don't trust this process. If you don't like the president, you trust the process. What you feel even about the Russians, whether it's a serious issue-- this was a Washington Post poll. Asked the question, ""Do you think that Russian efforts to influence the election was a serious issue?"" Only 13% of Republicans believe it's serious. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Republican Senator Ron Johnson said we've blown it-- ### AMY WALTER: ### --said it was blown out of proportion, the election interference. ### AMY WALTER: ### So we aren't going to agree. It doesn't matter what comes out. These numbers about how you feel about Mueller, how you feel about Russia are already baked into the cake. ### HUGH HEWITT: ### Well, let me - let me speak as a D.O.J. alum. I'm very proud of the Department of Justice. And what I take away from this indictment, if you colluded with Russia and you're an American, given the capacities that were demonstrated in that indictment, we will get you. We know everyone who colluded. And if they are not yet revealed - so you should put your hand up and run to the special counsel. Because we know everything that happened. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Alright. Something else happened this week. It was this Peter Strzok hearing. And for some reason it was decided to put it in public, which made it have a show trial feel. House Republicans - we'll see what you guys think, if they covered themselves in glory or not. Take a listen. ### REP. TREY GOWDY: ### I don't give a damn what you appreciate, Agent Strzok. ### REP. LOUIE GOHMERT: ### How many times did you look so innocent into your wife's eye and lie to her about Lisa Page? ### PETER STRZOK: ### Credibility-- ### REP. PAUL GOSAR: ### By the way, I'm a dentist. Okay? So I read body language very, very well. You got very angry in regards to the gold star father. That shows me that it's innately a part of you and a bias. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Elise, most of the hearing was speeches. And in fact, at one point Peter Strzok wanted, ""Can I respond to the question?"" ""No,"" he was told. Look, Peter Strzok committed some - obviously had some problems in what he did. And he appeared to at least let some of this stuff get to him a bit. But what the heck was that? ### ELISE JORDAN: ### It was political theatre. It was a circus that both sides weaponized for their own purposes. And we didn't learn anything new at the end of the day. After sitting through I think it was eight, nine hours of the theatre, what new information actually came out of it? We just know that this is going to continue to rip the country apart as they dig into their bias - into their bias and seize onto the sides that appeal most to their impressions. ### JOSHUA JOHNSON: ### Well, and it also doesn't help us rehabilitate the image of the F.B.I. or get down to what's actually happening at the F.B.I., whether there are changes that need to be made. I mean, remember that news conference that Chris Wray, the director of the F.B.I., gave I guess it was early last month in response to the inspector general's report? ### Before he started taking questions, he talked about some of the work the F.B.I. has been doing in the last 10 months. Rescuing more than 1,400 children from predators, including one who was as young as seven months old. In the last few months they stopped a terrorist plot against a mall in Miami and against Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. And they're doing all this amazing work from an outdated building, the J. Edgar Hoover Building that is in desperate need of replacement. There is a legitimate conversation to have about the F.B.I., including concerns from conservatives over whether politics motivated any investigation. That is a worthwhile question-- ### (OVERTALK) ### HUGH HEWITT: ### --I have to disagree with at least. We learned that Nellie Ohr gave the Fusion GPS dossier to Bruce Ohr. That's how it got to the-- ### CHUCK TODD: ### How do we know that? ### HUGH HEWITT: ### --Department of Justice-- at the end of the testimony at the very end of the day it came up in question. Otherwise-- ### CHUCK TODD: ### It came up in Jim Jordan's head. ### HUGH HEWITT: ### In Jim Jordan's head. And it was not contradicted by Peter Strzok. ### CHUCK TODD: ### Look-- I read this like a lawyer. ### CHUCK TODD: ### I’m sorry - no, you were making-- look, we're running out of time here. ### HUGH HEWITT: ### I believe it showed that we will find out in the end ### (OVERTALK) ### It didn't. He was told what he couldn't say by the F.B.I., Hugh. ### HUGH HEWITT: ### We will find out in the end how it all came together. But it's one investigation. I ask everyone just to wait on everything until the end. ### CHUCK TODD: ### All right. We'll leave it there. That's all for today. Whew. Thanks for watching. And remember, if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press."

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. ### JUST WATCHED ### Trump signs Russia sanctions bill ### The White House said the bill includes ""a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions"" ### Russia has reacted strongly to the bill, likening it to a ""fully-fledged trade war"" ### Washington (CNN) ### President Donald Trump signed into law Wednesday morning legislation that levies new sanctions against Russia and restricts Trump's own ability to ease sanctions in place against Moscow . ### The bill is one of the first major pieces of legislation that was sent to Trump's desk, and it represents a rebuke of the President by giving Congress new veto power to block him from removing Russia sanctions. ### The White House announced the signing shortly after 11 a.m. ET, saying the bill includes ""a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions"" that ""purport to displace the President's exclusive constitutional authority to recognize foreign governments, including their territorial bounds."" ### Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reacted strongly to the bill's signing, saying it showed a ""fully-fledged trade war (has been) declared against Russia"" and that ""the Trump administration demonstrated complete impotence, in the most humiliating manner, transferring executive powers to Congress."" ### Putin: Claims of election interference are 'anti-Russia hysteria' 01:33 ### Read More ### 'Seriously flawed' ### In a statement, Trump expressed his own doubts about the legislation: ""The bill remains seriously flawed -- particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch's authority to negotiate."" ### ""Congress could not even negotiate a health care bill after seven years of talking. By limiting the executive's flexibility, this bill makes it harder for the United States to strike good deals for the American people, and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together,"" he said in a statement. ### He ended the statement by saying: ""I built a truly great company worth many billions of dollars.  That is a big part of the reason I was elected.  As President, I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress."" ### Countermeasures? ### Even before Trump signed the bill, the measure prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to retaliate against the US over the new sanctions, which Congress levied over alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election, as well as Russia's annexation of Crimea and aggression in Syria. ### In a Facebook post Wednesday,  Medvedev said any hope of improved relations between Washington and the Kremlin had ""ended,"" adding he thought Trump was an ""incompetent player (who) must be eliminated."" ### Medvedev predicted future relations between Russia and the US ""will be extremely tense, regardless of the Congress line up or the personality of the President,"" and threatened to escalate the matter to international courts. ### Russia retaliates against US after sanctions 01:37 ### 'Dangerous' sanctions ### The new sanctions bill hits Russia's energy and defense sectors, and also includes fresh sanctions against Iran and North Korea. ### It comes amid increasing tension between the US and Russia, dating back to the last days of the Barack Obama administration, when the then President ordered the seizure of two Russian compounds in New York and Maryland in response to alleged election meddling by Moscow. ### Since the new sanctions were mooted, Russia has responded by ordering the US to cut staff at its diplomatic missions in the country by 755 employees , as well as seizing two US diplomatic properties . ### In a statement Wednesday, Russia's Foreign Ministry said it ""reserves the right to other countermeasures"" in response to the new sanctions and called the sanctions ""regrettable"", ""short-sighted"" and ""dangerous."" ### The measure was signed into law after it passed with overwhelming margins in both the House and Senate -- which made the threat of a presidential veto a non-starter -- but it was not an easy road to Trump's desk. ### After the Senate passed the sanctions on Iran and Russia 98-2, the bill languished in the House for more than a month amid a series of procedural fights. Then the House added North Korean sanctions before passing the measure 419-3, effectively forcing the Senate to swallow the new sanctions in order to get the legislation over the finish line before Congress left for its August congressional recess. ### OPINION: Trump and Putin locked in a hellish standoff ### The House and Senate struck a deal to make some changes to the bill at the urging of a host of US industries and European countries, but Congress did not consider making the change that the White House wanted: removing the congressional review on Russia sanctions from the bill. ### White House officials lobbied to weaken the section giving Congress a veto on the easing of sanctions, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Congress the administration should have ""flexibility"" to negotiate with Russia and improve relations. ### But key Republican and Democratic lawmakers said that weakening congressional review was not on the table when they were finalizing the legislation. ### Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, who initially was hesitant to pass a Russia sanctions bill before he was a key driver to get it done in July, said he has spoken to the President about the review process to try to ease the White House's concerns. ### Corker said that Congress would only veto an attempt to lessen sanctions on Russia if the administration took an ""egregious"" step to try to remove sanctions. ### ""I've walked the President through the process of how congressional review works,"" Corker said. ""The administration -- knowing that unless it's way out of bounds -- likely they have the flexibility to do what they need to do."" ### Corker noted that Trump has refused to believe his intelligence leaders that Russia interfered with the election, and said that may have helped push Congress to get the bill done quickly. ### ""I do think that the lack of strong statements in that regard probably effected the outcome,"" he said."

Both leader will meet for summit on Monday, July 16, 2018 in Helsinki, Finland. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, file) ### Comment ### By Associated Press ### GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- President Donald Trump says ""nothing bad ... maybe some good"" will come out of Monday's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as he attempted to lower expectations for what the meeting may actually achieve. Trump's national security adviser said they aren't looking for ""concrete deliverables."" ### Trump also says he ""hadn't thought"" about asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in Washington on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but says ""certainly I'll be asking about it."" ### He blamed the Democratic National Committee for ""allowing themselves to be hacked."" ### The U.S. has no extradition treaty with Moscow and can't compel Russia to hand over citizens, and a provision in Russia's constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens to foreign countries. ### Asked whether Trump would ask Putin to turn over the 12 military intelligence officials, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton called the idea ""pretty silly"" and said doing so would put the president in a ""weak position."" ### He said Trump is going into the summit with a stronger hand because of the indictments. ### ""I think the president can put this on the table and say, 'This is a serious matter that we need to talk about,'"" Bolton said. He said asking for the indicted Russians to be turned over would have the opposite effect. ### ""For the president to demand something that isn't going to happen puts the president in a weak position, and I think the president has made it very clear he intends to approach this discussion from a position of strength."" ### In the interview with CBS News, Trump said he's entering the meeting in Finland with ""low expectations. I'm not going with high expectations."" ### Trump taped the interview Saturday in Scotland. CBS News released excerpts Sunday, hours before Trump was set to fly to Helsinki for the summit. Trump said such sessions are beneficial. He cited his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June as ""a good thing"" and says ""having meetings with Russia, China, North Korea, I believe in it."" ### ""Nothing bad is going to come out of it (Helsinki), and maybe some good will come out,"" he said. ### Trump and Putin have met twice before, during international summits last year in Germany and in Vietnam. But Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, says Monday's meeting ""is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation and I hope it's a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests."" ### The president opened his first meeting with Putin -- it lasted more than two hours last July in Hamburg, Germany -- by pressing Putin on Russian election meddling and Putin denied being involved, according to U.S. officials who described the meeting afterward. ### Congressional Democrats and at least one Republican have called on the president to pull out of Monday's meeting unless he is willing to make Russian election-meddling the top issue. Huntsman said the meeting must go on because some international issues can't be solved without Russian engagement. ### ""Right now, there's no trust in the relationship and, because of that, problem-solving is practically impossible,"" Huntsman said. ""So this is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama and quite frankly some of the danger out of the relationship right now."" ### Huntsman added: ""The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off-the-charts high so it's a good thing these presidents are getting together."" ### Trump has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling, along with Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation and other topics. Bolton described the meeting as ""unstructured,"" saying: ""We're not looking for concrete deliverables here."" ### Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., meanwhile, suggested that Trump not even bother to press Putin on election meddling because ""he's not going to admit that he did it."" Instead, Paul said Trump and other U.S. officials should focus on safeguarding upcoming elections from interference. ### Earlier today I joined @edhenry on @FoxNews to discuss the importance of engaging Russia.

That doesn’t seem to apply here, and it’s a really bad idea for Trump to meet alone with Putin and possibly make some sort of statement that Putin interprets or misinterprets as flashing green light for further adventurism. That’s why it’s particularly important to have the professionals in the room on this. ### As for Trump’s posture toward Russia, it continues to be a welter of contradictions. We’ve gone through a week where Trump was supposedly destroying the Western alliance, allegedly at Putin’s bidding, at the same time the president was forcefully advocating two policies anathema to the Kremlin: More European defense spending and opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. ### Rich Lowry Posted at 11:40 am on July 15, 2018 ### nationalreview.com/corner/its-a-really-bad-idea-to-meet-alone-with-putin/"

The United States looks forward to finalising a great bilateral trade agreement,"" he said. ### - Tackling Theresa May - ### In Trump's Sun interview, he said Boris Johnson, who quit as Britain's foreign minister over May's Brexit proposals, would make a ""great prime minister"". ### Many in Britain interpreted that as undermining May before they had even met, combined with his Brexit intervention. ### But he lavished praise on her after their meeting at the premier's Chequers country residence. ### ""She's a tough negotiator... She's a very, very smart and determined person... she left a lot of people in her wake,"" he said. ### ""I would much rather have her as my friend than my enemy."" ### - Face-off with Putin - ### Trump ends his visit by meeting Putin in the Finnish capital. Before leaving Washington, he said tackling Putin might surprisingly be the easiest part of the trip. ### He said Friday he had been ""extremely tough on Russia... far tougher on Russia than anybody"". ### Referring to an ongoing investigation into ties between his election campaign and Russia, he decried a ""rigged witch-hunt"" that was hurting the United States and its relationship with Moscow. ### Trump said he was ""not going in with high expectations"" but wanted to develop a personal relationship with Putin, which he hoped would yield some ""very surprising things""."

The term also captures how Finland, now a member of the European Union, remained officially neutral during the Cold War. It's a status that has involved compromises. ### There are no illusions here about what the biggest threat to Finland is. ### ""It's Russia that's a potential enemy,"" Peltonen said as he showed CNN around a nuclear bunker, 18 meters below ground. ### Finland's historical neutrality and its proximity to Russia made it a choice venue for Cold War era summits, characteristics that have once again thrust it into the spotlight. ### It's not clear what Trump and Putin will agree here in Helsinki on Monday, and few details of their meeting inside the tightly guarded presidential palace have been revealed. ### But there is no shortage of topics to discuss. Twelve Russian nationals were indicted in the United States on Friday as part of a special investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. ### Trump goes to Helsinki after visiting the United Kingdom, where he expressed support for Britain over poisoning cases that the government there blames on Russia. There is still the unresolved matter of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, shot down over eastern Ukraine. Western leaders openly blame Russian-backed rebels. ### Moscow denies involvement in any of these incidents, though it openly celebrates its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, something Trump has said he would never have allowed under his watch. ### The Kremlin said it expects arms control and the conflict in Syria to be on the agenda. ### But analysts say there's also the possibility of an unexpected concession. President Trump, who says he wants to ""get on"" with Russia, recently suggested he would discuss suspending military exercises in the Baltics if his Russian counterpart requested it. ### Making concessions to Russia, for the sake of getting on, is something analysts say Finland has turned into a fine art. ### ""Finland's approach to Russia is about dialogue and, in extremis, deterrence,"" said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. ### ""Your neighbors trade, your politicians and civil servants talk, but you have to be ready to defend yourself."" ### Engage with Moscow, but also prepare for the worst -- that's how tiny Finland has survived in the dark shadow of its Russian neighbor. ### The United States, with a president set on forging a better relationship with Moscow, could soon follow suit. ### Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

The arguments feed the Kremlin narrative that democracy is dangerous unless it is carefully ‘‘managed.’’ ### Russian commentators and editorialists who consider the European Union hostile, troublesome or irrelevant welcomed Trump’s criticism of longtime European allies as ‘‘foes’’ to the U.S. ### Russia’s state-run Channel One said Trump’s meetings in Britain and contentious appearance at the NATO summit last week were secondary to Monday’s summit, saying: ‘‘After all, he was just passing through Brussels and London on the way to Helsinki.’’ ### Advertisement ### Konstantin Kosachev, head of the upper house of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, wrote in Izvestia that Monday’s talks come at a time when ‘‘so-called ‘peace-loving’ Europe is afraid of peace talks between U.S. and Russia.’’ ### Russian media did have rather tempered expectations of how much Putin can concretely get from the summit, but hoped for progress on solutions for Syria and Mideast tensions. ### Heading into the summit, Trump denounced the American news media as the ‘‘enemy of the people,’’ despite constitutional protections for freedom of the press. ### The Russian media scene is a different beast. Under Putin, the government has assumed control or sway over most broadcasters and mainstream media and put pressure on critical reporting online. Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some outspoken Russian journalists. ### A protest sign for the summit posted on a Helsinki bus stop Monday read ‘‘Unpleasant things will happen to Journalists who ask Putin questions.’’ ### Advertisement ### Despite clear interest in Russia in Putin’s meeting with Trump, the summit wasn’t the No. 1 item on many Russian newscasts or websites Monday: That honor went to the World Cup, and Russia’s own global image. ### "

The President said Strzok, who had sent texts critical of Trump, was ""a disgrace to our country"" and ""a disgrace to the FBI."" ### ""I thought (Strzok's testimony) was an absolute disgrace. Where he wants to do things against me before I was even, I guess before I was even the candidate. It was a disgrace,"" Trump said during the interview at his resort in Turnberry, Scotland. ""And then he lied about it. And you know, talking about shutting it down and 'we, we.' And he says, 'Oh, I meant the American people' all of a sudden, you know, he came up with excuses, I guess, given to a lawyer, but everybody laughed at it."" ### Trump tweeted later Sunday that he believes no matter how well the summit with Putin goes, he'll face criticism from Democrats and the media. ### Read More ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia (...) over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough -- that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!""

Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia... ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 15, 2018 ### During the hearing, Republicans charged that Strzok's texts were evidence that he was biased to clear Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and go after Trump, grilling the agent about the messages he exchanged with then-FBI lawyer Lisa Page, with whom Strzok had an extramarital affair, that led to his dismissal from special counsel Robert Mueller's team. ### Strzok's role in the investigation, the President remarked, ""hurts our relationship with Russia"" and ""a lot of countries."" ### ""I think it's a disgrace what's going on. And then you look how, you know, partisan it is. You look at what's going on where -- and they know, they know that there's no way he can get away from those horrible texts that he wrote,"" Trump said. ""So the other side does. But it's a very partisan thing."" ### Trump indicated Saturday that he had not thought of talking to Putin about the extradition of a dozen Russian military intelligence agents indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for allegedly hacking Democrats' emails and computer networks during the 2016 election. ### When asked if he would raise the issue with the Russian leader, the President told CBS News, ""Well, I might. I hadn't thought of that, but certainly I'll be asking about it."" ### CNN's Jeremy Herb and Laura Jarrett contributed to this report."

And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. ### SIGN ME UP! ### He said that Russia is a foe ""in certain respects"" and that China is a foe ""economically ... but that doesn't mean they are bad. It doesn't mean anything. It means that they are competitive."" ### Trump has been reluctant to criticize Putin over the years and has described him in recent days not as an enemy but as a competitor. ### On Sunday, Trump flew to Finland, the final stop on a weeklong trip that began last Tuesday. Near Trump's hotel, police roped off a group of about 60 mostly male pro-Trump demonstrators waving American flags. Big banners said ""Welcome Trump"" and ""God Bless D & M Trump"" and a helicopter hovered overhead. ### Chants of ""We love Trump, We love Trump"" broke out as the president's motorcade passed, and Trump waved. ### Trump set expectations for the summit low, telling CBS News, ""I don't expect anything. ... I go in with very low expectations."" His national security adviser said they weren't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" ### He also said in the interview taped Saturday that he ""hadn't thought"" about asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in Washington on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ### But after being given the idea by his interviewer, Trump said, ""Certainly I'll be asking about it."" ### The U.S. has no extradition treaty with Moscow and can't compel Russia to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens to foreign countries. ### Contradicting Trump in an interview on ABC's ""This Week,"" U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the idea of asking Putin to turn over the 12 military intelligence officials was ""pretty silly"" and argued that doing so would put the U.S. president in a ""weak position."" ### He also argued that Trump is entering the summit with a stronger hand because of the indictments. ### ""I think the president can put this on the table and say, 'This is a serious matter that we need to talk about,'"" said Bolton, adding that asking for the indicted Russians to be turned over would have the opposite effect. ### Related stories from  Miami Herald ### Russian meddling in US midterms? More fear than proof so far ### In the CBS News interview, Trump declined to discuss his goals for the summit — ""I'll let you know after the meeting,"" he said — but said he believes such sessions are beneficial. ### He cited his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June as a ""good thing,"" along with meetings he's had with Chinese President Xi Jinping. ### ""Nothing bad is going to come out of"" the Helsinki meeting, he said, ""and maybe some good will come out."" ### From aboard Air Force One, Trump complained in tweets that he wasn't getting enough credit for his meeting with Kim and railed that ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people"" as he headed to sit down with Putin. ### Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some Russian journalists. Trump regularly criticizes American news media outlets and has called out some journalists by name. ### Trump complained: ""No matter how well I do at the Summit,"" he'll face ""criticism that it wasn't good enough."" ### ""If I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough — that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" he tweeted. ### Trump also praised Putin for holding the World Cup, which finished up Sunday. ### Trump and Putin have held talks several times before. Their first meeting came last July when both participated in an international summit and continued for more than two hours, well over the scheduled 30 minutes. The leaders also met last fall during a separate summit in Vietnam. ### But Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, said Monday's meeting ""is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation, and I hope it's a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests."" ### Congressional Democrats and at least one Republican have called on Trump to pull out of Monday's meeting unless he is willing to make Russian election-meddling the top issue. Huntsman said the summit must go on because Russian engagement is needed to solve some international issues. ### ""The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off-the-charts high so it's a good thing these presidents are getting together,"" he said during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ### Trump has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling, along with Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation and other topics. Bolton described the meeting as ""unstructured"" and said: ""We're not looking for concrete deliverables here."""

5691,npr.org,2018-07-15T06:20:07-04:00,"U.S.-Russia Summits, From Gravely Serious To Absurdly Comical ### By Greg Myre ### Weekend Edition Sunday,  · Summits between U.S. presidents and Kremlin leaders are often filled with great drama and moments that shape history. ### And then there's Boris Yeltsin's 1994 visit to Washington. ### The Russian president was staying at Blair House, the guest quarters across the street from the White House. As his host, President Bill Clinton, revealed years later, Yeltsin felt the urge to slip out late one night. He was on his way when U.S. Secret Service agents found the Russian leader in his underwear, slurring his words and desperate for a pizza. ### The larger point is that these summits — gravely serious or absurdly comical — tend to capture the mood or even define the relationship between Washington and Moscow. ### Clinton and Yeltsin were famously chummy. Their conclaves were hug fests, befitting the moment. The Cold War had just ended and they both saw cooperation as the way forward, even though they had substantial disagreements over issues like NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe. ### ""They seemed to enjoy a close relationship,"" said Angela Stent , head of the Russian studies program at Georgetown University. ""I think that just reflected that brief interlude in the 1990s when you had a Russian leadership that was pro-West and wanted to move closer to the United States. But that went away rather quickly by the end of Yeltsin's tenure."" ### Stent has followed the summits for decades and has met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin every year for the past 14 years as part of a group of scholars invited to Russia. ### At the meeting last October, Putin ""criticized the Americans. 'Why are you Americans so critical of your own president? You're not showing him enough respect. You should let him do his job,'"" she said. ""Two minutes later, he was really lambasting American foreign policy and all the terrible things Americans were doing."" ### Trump and Putin are due to meet Monday in Helsinki, Finland, at a time when U.S.-Russia friction is reminiscent of the Cold War. And that Cold War history teaches us that summits can be treacherous. ### President John F. Kennedy was young and new to his office in 1961 when he met for two days in Vienna with the bombastic Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. ### Kennedy was stoic in his public remarks afterward. ### ""I will tell you now that it was a very sober two days. There was no discourtesy, no loss of tempers, no threats or ultimatums by either side,"" Kennedy said. ### But in private , Kennedy conceded that the Soviet leader ""beat the hell out of me. I've got a terrible problem if he thinks I'm inexperienced and have no guts."" ### ""Khrushchev reached an erroneous conclusion that John Kennedy was a pushover,"" said Dimitri Simes , head of the conservative Center for the National Interest in Washington. ### ""In this case, he has calculated wrong. He got an impression that if you really put pressure on President Kennedy, he would likely retreat,"" said Simes. ### Two months after the summit, an emboldened Khrushchev gave the green light for East Germany to build the Berlin Wall, exacerbating an international crisis over the divided city. ### The following year, Khrushchev shipped Soviet missiles to Cuba. This pushed the superpowers to the brink of nuclear war before the Soviets agreed to withdraw their weapons. ### While these summits were high-risk, Simes said no real alternative existed in an era when relations between the countries were extremely limited. ### ""In the case of the Soviet Union, if you if you wanted to talk to them, you would have to talk to the Kremlin,"" Simes said. ""Summits were the only meaningful way to have any serious conversation with them."" ### The upside was that leaders could make things happen very quickly. ### At a 1986 summit in Iceland between President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, the U.S. leader ""was very skeptical about Gorbachev,"" Stent said. ### ""But they had this meeting, the first meeting, and they came out of it suddenly telling their aides, 'Oh, we've decided that we're going to abolish nuclear weapons by the year 2000,'"" she said. ""Their aides were absolutely shocked."" ### They never went that far. But they did sign an agreement the following year banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles. And they established the trust that kept tensions in check as the Soviet Union collapsed internally in the years that followed. ### However, relationships based on trust haven't always worked. President George W. Bush initially thought he had connected with Putin. ### ""I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy. We had a very good dialogue. I was able to get a sense of his soul,"" Bush said after he met Putin in 2001. ### Relations quickly soured and Bush was criticized as naive. President Barack Obama tried to reset relations, but that too ended in a downward spiral of mutual recriminations. ### Trump thinks he'll do better. ### "" Putin's fine. He's fine. We're all fine. We're people. Will I be prepared? Totally prepared. I've been preparing for this stuff my whole life,"" the president said. ### Greg Myre is a national security correspondent.

He is the author of "" From Cold War to Hot Peace: An American Ambassador in Putin’s Russia ."" ### President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have met before, but not in a summit as they will on Monday. (Evan Vucci/AP) ### HELSINKI — I was the U.S. ambassador to Russia for two years and worked on Russia policy for the Obama administration for three years before that. I never had my own one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But I did participate in a half-dozen sessions with Putin alongside President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, national security adviser Tom Donilon and Secretary of State John F. Kerry. I have followed and written about Putin’s career since first meeting him in the mayor’s office in St. Petersburg in the spring of 1991. President Trump may think Monday’s summit will be  easier than meeting with U.S. allies last week was. But if he decides to do any serious preparation before he sits down with Putin, here’s what he should know. ### First, Putin prefers small groups. When I was in the government, we had to fight constantly with Putin’s protocol team about the number of people allowed to attend his meetings. We always wanted more; Putin’s team preferred less. In his first meeting with Obama in 2009, we could not persuade Putin’s protocol people to allow our ambassador to Russia at the time, John Beyrle, to attend. When Hillary Clinton first met with Putin in Moscow as secretary of state in 2009, I was Obama’s senior adviser for Russia at the National Security Council. I was walking into the room with her when one of Putin’s assistants grabbed my arm and escorted me to a holding room with other U.S. officials. When Donilon met with Putin in 2012, Putin’s staff made several senior members of our delegation sit in cars outside the compound walls of his country estate. As ambassador, I was the only other American allowed at that meeting. ### Second, Putin is extremely confident — some might say arrogant — in his views about international affairs. He was not always this way. Putin was an accidental president, chosen by Russian President Boris Yeltsin as his successor in 1999; the Russian voters simply ratified Yeltsin’s choice. Back then, Putin was unsure of himself in foreign policy. He listened to others, both in his government and to other heads of state. But now, he has been on the job for two decades, save for a brief interregnum when he switched posts with his prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev. Today, he listens to no one; not his national security advisers, not Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and most certainly not to Trump. Putin knows it all. ### [ Putin needed an American enemy. He picked me. ] ### In fairness to Putin, he is well-versed in international issues by now, especially after overseeing Russian military interventions in Ukraine and Syria, cyber interventions and propaganda operations in the United States, and ties to autocrats in North Korea and Iran now for nearly two decades. His theories are flawed; his prescriptions are dangerous. But he knows the details of these issues way better than Trump, or indeed almost any other head of state in the world. That’s why the extended one-on-one meeting with Trump planned for the summit gives Putin a huge advantage. ### Third, Putin — according to Putin — has never done anything wrong. In his view, current tensions in U.S.-Russian relations are all Obama’s fault, just like they were all the Bush administration’s fault before Obama took office. In his first meeting with Obama in Moscow in July 2009, Putin explained as much about the Bush administration (interestingly, he did not assign fault to Bush personally, but rather blamed those around him), going on for an entire hour without interruption to chronicle all of America’s mistakes up to then. So Putin will be waiting for concessions, rhetorical and substantive, from Trump to get our bilateral relationship on track. Putin, though, will never offer a real concession. He rarely even engages in negotiation. The idea floated by Trump recently that Putin might do him a favor and get out of Ukraine or Syria is laughable. Putin does no one any favors. Geopolitics for him is a zero-sum game. ### Fourth, Putin is a persuasive storyteller. In my view, his interpretations of historical events are incomplete, skewed and wrong. But if you don’t know the facts, his arguments can sound persuasive. In his meeting with  Obama in June 2012 in Los Cabos, Mexico, Putin articulated a very forceful argument for why strongmen had to guide evolutionary modernization in the Middle East. He portrayed both Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak as such leaders and berated us for giving up on Mubarak too soon. He made clear that he would not do the same to Assad, not because he had a strong personal relationship with the Syrian dictator but because there was no alternative. As I listened, I thought of dozens of flaws in his analysis. But if I didn’t know the history of the region or the academic literature on transitions from authoritarian rule, Putin would have sounded convincing. I worry about the lecture Putin might give to Trump about Arab culture or Crimean history. I’m not confident that Trump knows the details of these issues well enough to push back. ### To tell his stories, Putin uses blunt, simple, colorful language. The change in rhetorical style between the refined Medvedev and cruder Putin was striking when they switched roles. Trump will like Putin’s style. ### [ Why Russians like Putin’s wars ] ### Fifth, Putin can be both abrasive and charming. I’ve seen both negotiating strategies in person. With Trump, Putin will be in charming mode: He will seek to bond over their common disdain for the media, the “deep state” and international institutions. Putin will have Trump nodding along in agreement within minutes. He is good at demonstrating affinity (what he really believes is another matter). Remember his training: He’s a former intelligence officer. And with Trump, it will be even easier to find common ground, since they do share some views about the nature of the world. Trump has expressed his hostility to multilateral organizations like the European Union, NATO and the WTO. Putin loathes all those groups. Likewise, both Trump and Putin have embraced nativist nationalists in Europe in the United Kingdom, France, Hungary and Italy. ### Sixth, Putin is capable of the bold, unexpected move, sometimes for good and sometimes for bad. Putin has way more autonomy running the Russian government than Trump has in the United States. In convincing us that we needed a presidential summit in September 2013, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, emphasized this point, stressing that Putin liked the bold gesture if things were going well. Trump should be ready with smart answers to possible grand bargains such as Iranian withdrawal from Syria in return for our withdrawal. That’s a bad deal, even if Putin could deliver on it, since our retreat could allow ISIS to regroup and reemerge as a threat to our allies in the region and even us. But the proposal might sound attractive in a one-on-one talk with Putin, trying to get along. And we know how Trump likes deals. ### Seventh, Putin leaves a big impression. Every meeting with him is memorable. As we drove back to Moscow after our breakfast with Putin in 2009, I could tell that Obama was still trying to digest the measure of the man. I fear Trump will be easily captivated by Putin’s swagger. ### Finally, Putin will likely be late. He made Obama wait for 45 minutes before their meeting in Los Cabos. Kerry wandered Red Square and then chilled at the Ritz Carlton for several hours before Putin was finally ready to host us at the Kremlin in 2013. Of course, Putin wants to make a good impression with Trump. If he is on time, that might signal his real desire to embrace Trump — and then we should all get a little more worried. ### I was supposed to go to one other planned summit between Obama and Putin in September 2013 in Moscow. Our embassy had worked on the details of this two-day meeting for months. But when Putin wouldn’t agree to generate a substantive agenda, particularly on Syria and arms control, we started to doubt the value of the meeting. Putin’s decision to grant former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden asylum that summer sealed the deal. We could not have Obama standing next to Putin pretending everything was business as usual after such a provocative act. Obama canceled the summit. I delivered the news to the Kremlin, and they were genuinely upset with our acceptance and then refusal of their invitation to come to Moscow. ### But sometimes not talking — not showing up — is the right diplomatic move. Maybe there’s a lesson in this story for Trump? ### Read more:"

John McCain on Friday praised the Justice Department’s indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers and called on President Donald Trump to cancel his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin if he is “not prepared to hold Putin accountable.” ### The Russian intelligence officers were charged with hacking the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign — the latest charges brought in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. ### “These revelations add to a body of evidence confirming an extensive plot by Vladimir Putin’s government to attack the 2016 election, sow chaos and dissension among the American electorate, and undermine faith in our democracy,”McCain said in a statement on Friday. “And despite repeated warnings from our nation’s top intelligence and military leaders, the Kremlin’s efforts to weaken our institutions have continued unabated with insufficient action taken by the administration or Congress to strengthen our cyber defenses, safeguard our election systems, and deter further destabilizing activities.” ### Trump is slated to meet with Putin in Helsinki on Monday. ### “President Trump must be willing to confront Putin from a position of strength and demonstrate that there will be a serious price to pay for his ongoing aggression towards the United States and democracies around the world,” McCain said. “If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward.” ### Trump said Tuesday that his meeting with Putin “may be the easiest” out of all his other meetings with NATO leaders this week. And on Friday, he voiced skepticism that the meeting with Putin would result in a confession about election meddling. ### “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it, I did it, you got me,’” Trump said Friday morning before the indictments were announced. “There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think, but you never know what happens, right?”"

But coming amid fresh allegations into Russia’s attempts to sway the 2016 election, the sessions on election security have a higher level of urgency and interest. ### Nielsen said her agency will help state and local election officials prepare their systems for cyberattacks from Russia or elsewhere. She said U.S. intelligence officials are seeing “persistent Russian efforts using social media, sympathetic spokespeople and other fronts to sow discord and divisiveness amongst the American people, though not necessarily focused on specific politicians or political campaigns.” ### The conference of top state election officials she addressed was sandwiched between Friday’s indictments of 12 Russian military intelligence officers alleged to have hacked into Democratic party and campaign accounts and Monday’s long-awaited meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### Trump has never condemned Russia over meddling in the 2016 election despite the findings of all top U.S. intelligence agencies, and the Kremlin has insisted it didn’t meddle in the U.S. election. In the past, Trump has reiterated Putin’s denials, but this week he said he would bring up the issue when they meet on Monday in Finland. ### “All I can do is say, ‘Did you?’” Trump said days ago at a news conference in Brussels. “And, ‘Don’t do it again.’ But he may deny it.” ### Some of the state officials who run elections say it’s important for Trump, a Republican, to take a tougher stance to avoid having the public’s confidence in fair elections undermined. ### “I believe as commander in chief he has an obligation to address it and, frankly, put Putin and any other foreign nation that seeks to undermine our democracy on notice that the actions will not be tolerated,” California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said in an interview this week. ### Some of his peers declined to go that far. ### “I don’t go around telling the president what to do,” said Jay Ashcroft, the Republican secretary of state in Missouri. ### Trump portrays the investigation as a partisan attack, but not all Republicans see it that way. This month, the Republicans and Democrats on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee backed the findings of an assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election and acted in favor of Trump and against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. ### As part of that effort, Russian hackers targeted at least 21 states ahead of the election and are believed to have breached the voter registration system in at least one, Illinois, investigators say. Without naming the state, Friday’s indictment said the Russian intelligence officers stole information on about 500,000 voters from the website of one board of elections, a breach undetected for three weeks. ### There’s no evidence results were altered, but the attempts prompted the federal government and states to re-examine election systems and tighten their cybersecurity. ### Federal officials also say it’s possible that malware might have been planted that could tamper with voting or paralyze computer systems in future elections. ### The election officials talked about technical details of blocking an incursion. ### Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican, told her peers how her state is using its National Guard to help test and shore up cybersecurity for elections. She said it’s important to make it clear to voters that the military is not running elections and does not have access to election data. ### “The whole idea of this is to instill confidence in voters and the public that the system is secure,” Wyman said in an interview. ### Some state officials also said Homeland Security is becoming more helpful in sharing information. ### On Friday, a federal grand jury indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers on charges they hacked into Democratic campaign networks in 2016 and then stole and released tens of thousands of documents. The indictment says one of the intrusions came that summer, on a vendor whose software is used to verify voter registration information. The indictment references a spoof email it says the Russian agents sent to more than 100 election-managing customers of the vendor to try to get more information. ### “The indictments tell us that … no longer can we deny in any shape or form that Russians were involved,” said cybersecurity expert Sam Woolley, of the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, California."

He added: ""There are quite a few of them for us to pay attention to."" ### Putin struck a casual pose during Trump's remarks, slouching in his chair with his legs wide and eyes low. He nodded along to some of Trump's remarks before they were translated, showcasing his fluency in English. Trump leaned forward in his chair, his hands tented in front of him and frequently glancing over at the Russian president. At one point, he shot Putin a wink. After Trump concluded his remarks, American reporters shouted several questions about whether he would bring up election meddling during his discussions with Putin. ### Trump did not respond; Putin appeared to smirk. ### With that, the two leaders gave a quick handshake and their private meeting in the opulent Gothic Hall was under way. Just the two of them, each with a translator. ### The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States -- and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea -- for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow's aggression may go unchallenged. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming ""many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" ### Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt! ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018 ### The summit, which was being closely monitored by rattled world capitals, was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump's presidential campaign. Undeterred, the American president was set to go face to face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian's leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British queen, among many others. ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn't ""expect anything"" from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. Not mentioned: Election meddling or Syria. ### Trump said last week that he would raise the election-meddling issue with Putin, but said he didn't expect Putin to budge on his denials. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### They'll continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."" ### U.S. President Donald Trump, centre left and Russian President Vladimir Putin take their seats before the start of their meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland, Monday, July 16, 2018.

News that paid employees of the Russian government—military intelligence officers, no less—interfered and sought to influence the 2016 presidential election, coming just days before the victor of that election will meet Russian president Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, amounts to nothing less than an international geopolitical bombshell. The new charges, which come in an 11-count, 29-page indictment, lays out Russia's alleged efforts in the excruciating detail and specificity that has become the Mueller investigative team's hallmark."
5870,nytimes.com,2018-07-15T20:06:36-04:00,"That investigation seems to be incredibly fruitful. According to Vox’s tally : ### “Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team has either indicted or gotten guilty pleas from 32 people and three companies — that we know of. That group is composed of four former Trump advisers, 26 Russian nationals, three Russian companies, one California man, and one London-based lawyer. Five of these people (including three former Trump aides) have already pleaded guilty.” ### Twelve of those indictments came last week with a disturbingly detailed account of what the Russians did. As The New York Times put it : ### “From phishing attacks to gain access to Democratic operatives, to money laundering, to attempts to break into state elections boards, the indictment details a vigorous and complex effort by Russia’s top military intelligence service to sabotage the campaign of Mr. Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.” ### Whether or not Trump himself or anyone in his orbit personally colluded or conspired with the Russians about their interference is something Mueller will no doubt disclose at some point, but there remains one incontrovertible truth: In 2016, Russia, a hostile foreign adversary, attacked the United States of America. ### We know that they did it. We have proof. The F.B.I. is trying to hold people accountable for it. ### And yet Trump, the president whom the Constitution establishes as the commander-in-chief, has repeatedly waffled on whether Russia conducted the attack and has refused to forcefully rebuke them for it, let alone punish them for it. ### In March, the White House, under pressure from Congress, seemed to somewhat reluctantly impose some sanctions on Russia for its crimes. As CNN reported that month, Congress almost unanimously passed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act last summer “hoping to pressure Trump into punishing Russia for its election interference.” But as the network pointed out: ### “Trump signed the bill reluctantly in August, claiming it impinged upon his executive powers and could dampen his attempts to improve ties with Moscow.” ### Instead, Trump has repeatedly attacked the investigation as a witch hunt. ### Just last week at a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump said: ### “I think I would have a very good relationship with Putin if we spend time together. After watching the rigged witch-hunt yesterday, I think it really hurts our country and our relationship with Russia. I hope we can have a good relationship with Russia.” ### Now Trump is set to pursue just such a relationship as he meets one-on-one with Russian president Vladimir Putin on Monday in Finland. As Trump said earlier this month at a rally: ### “Will he be prepared? Will he be prepared? And I might even end up having a good relationship, but they’re going, ‘Will President Trump be prepared? You know, President Putin is K.G.B. and this and that.’ You know what? Putin’s fine. He’s fine. We’re all fine. We’re people.” ### Actually, none of this is fine. None of it! Trump should be directing all resources at his disposal to punish Russia for the attacks and prevent future ones. But he is not. ### America’s commander wants to be chummy with the enemy who committed the crime. Trump is more concerned with protecting his presidency and validating his election than he is in protecting this country. ### This is an incredible, unprecedented moment. America is being betrayed by its own president. America is under attack and its president absolutely refuses to defend it. ### Simply put, Trump is a traitor and may well be treasonous.  ### Charles M. Blow has been an Op-Ed columnist since 2008.

He muses about eliminating them but also has called for a U.S. buildup and bragged about his nuclear “button.” ### In March, while forecasting a face-to-face meeting on this topic with Russian President Vladimir Putin , Trump said in the same breath that an arms race was “getting out of control” and that he would never allow any country to have weapons “even close to what we have,” although Russia already does. ### How these seemingly competing instincts will play out in his talks Monday with Putin in Helsinki could profoundly affect the direction of U.S. defense policy. ### Before leaving a NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday, Trump was asked by a reporter whether he would raise long-standing U.S. allegations that Russia is violating a Cold War-era nuclear arms treaty, and whether he favors extending a separate treaty that he has criticized in the past as disadvantaging the U.S. ### His one-word answer to the two-part question was “yes” - the first public indication that he wants to extend the New Start treaty, which expires in three years. Then on Friday, he vaguely spoke about how “it would be a tremendous achievement if we could do something about nuclear proliferation.” ### Yet Trump ’s administration has shown little interest in negotiating further reductions in American and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. It has been more focused on formulating its own nuclear policy and on combating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea. ### U.S.-Russian strategic nuclear weapons - those capable of striking each other’s territory - are governed by New Start, which was negotiated by the Obama administration in 2010. It limits each country to 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads. President Barack Obama favored further cuts, but U.S.-Russian relations soured after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. ### The New Start deal is set to expire in February 2021 unless both sides agree to extend it. The Trump administration has been reviewing its position, so it’s unclear whether Trump and Putin will do more than agree that their staffs should study the possibility of an extension. Private U.S. arms control advocates are urging an extension, in part because they see value in a treaty provision allowing each side to monitor what the other is doing on strategic weapons. ### Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, says Trump and Putin could instruct their aides to begin formal work on a five-year extension of the treaty, which would not require a renegotiation of its terms or ratification by the legislative branch of either government. ### “If they don’t extend New Start, there is a worrisome possibility that by 2021 there will be no legally binding limits on the world’s two largest arsenals, and as a result, all of the difficult security challenges we have with the Russians will become even more difficult to manage,” Kimball said. ### Analysts have puzzled over Trump ’s likely approach to an arms control discussion with Putin . The Russian leader said in May that his military would soon begin fielding a new generation of nuclear weapons, including a globe-circling ballistic missile that he previously said could fly over either the North or the South Pole to strike targets anywhere in the world with more powerful and more numerous warheads. Putin claimed it could evade any missile defense system. ### Putin also has promoted Russia ’s development of a nuclear-armed hypersonic vehicle that he said is more advanced than anything in the U.S. arsenal. Hypersonic flight equates to going Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. The U.S. is working on hypersonic missile technology but has said it fears falling behind Russia and China. ### Trump and Putin seem unlikely to get into this sort of detail, given that arms control would be just one of several topics raised, including the Syrian civil war. ### Even Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, seemed uncertain how Trump would address arms control issues in Helsinki, but he predicted they would discuss U.S. accusations that Russia is violating the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. ### That was the first superpower agreement to ban an entire class of weapons: ground-launched and cruise missiles with ranges of between 500 kilometers and 5,500 kilometers, or about 310 miles and 3,400 miles. Washington says Moscow is violating the treaty by testing and deploying a prohibited cruise missile. Russia strongly denies any violation and has in turn charged that some elements of Washington’s missile defense system violate the treaty. ### Stephan Sestanovich, a senior fellow for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, sees room for a Trump - Putin agreement on resolving these violation charges. ### “You could have verification visits by the two sides to address that,” he said, suggesting physical inspections of perhaps the Russian missile’s fuel tank. That could help resolve the question of how far the missile can fly, while also protecting against disclosure of sensitive missile technology information. ### The list of U.S. complaints about Russian behavior in the nuclear realm has grown longer in recent years. This tension is captured in the Trump administration’s updated nuclear policy, which points to Russian reliance on nuclear weapons as justification for deploying new types of U.S. nuclear weapons. ### It warned that Russian strategy on the potential coercive and military uses of nuclear weapons, “increase the prospect for dangerous miscalculation and escalation.” ### Copyright © 2018 The Washington Times, LLC.

5953,cnn.com,2018-07-15T14:58:10-04:00,"Trump tells officials how Putin will respond to meddling question ### But on the eve of their summit, Trump's relationship with the Russian president is facing even more scrutiny in the wake of the latest round of charges of Russian interference in the US election. Putin has never been at the red-hot center of American politics as he is today. ### The White House rejected calls to cancel the summit after 12 Russian military intelligence officers were charged Friday with hacking into Democrats' computer networks and emails during the 2016 presidential race. ### The indictments, announced as the President was visiting Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle, prompted a joke, not a condemnation, from Trump, even though he was briefed in advance that the charges were coming. ### ""I know you'll ask, will we be talking about meddling? And I will absolutely bring that up,"" Trump said. ""I don't think you'll have any, 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.' There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think."" ### Since taking office, the US President has barely acknowledged Russian election meddling, let alone forcefully confronted Putin for masterminding it, as the US intelligence community believes. ### And there are no signs that will change in Helsinki. ### As he flew here on Sunday from a weekend at his golf resort in Scotland, he once again cast the election meddling in a sarcastic light in a message on Twitter. ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough -- that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" he wrote. ### Yet Trump has repeatedly diminished any dark motives on the part of Putin, who has become a recurring theme at his campaign rallies in the weeks leading up to the summit. ### ""But they're going, 'Will President Trump be prepared? You know, President Putin is KGB,' "" Trump said last week in Montana. ""You know what? Putin's fine. He's fine."" ### Trump suggests he will bring up indicted Russians with Putin, says it's something he 'hadn't thought of' ### The Russian President has been isolated and punished by much of the world for a litany of aggressions and atrocities, including the invasion of Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea, the downing of a Polish plane, the deadly nerve agent attack in the United Kingdom and support for the Assad regime in Syria. ### Yet Trump has repeatedly argued that improving relations with Russia is critical. While the circumstances now are entirely different than during recent administrations, given the charges of election interference, Trump is following a pattern of new American presidents trying to reset a troubled relationship with Russia. ### ""Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all thought that they could make friends with Vladimir Putin that could somehow reestablish the relationship,"" Susan Glasser, a CNN global affairs analyst, said in an interview here Sunday. ### ""All of them came away believing that personalizing dealings with the United States and Russia was a mistake and that Vladimir Putin was absolutely unsentimental, cold-hearted and not somebody who could be swayed by the great charisma and magnetism of the American presidency,"" said Glasser, co-author of ""Kremlin Rising: Vladimir Putin's Russia and the End of the Revolution."" ### Trump, however, insists he will be different. ### Helsinki is Trump's first solo summit with Putin, but it marks their third meeting. After an initial introduction last summer at the G20 summit in Hamburg, they met again briefly last fall at an economic forum in Hanoi, Vietnam, where Trump showed little appetite for challenging Putin on election hacking. ### ""I believe that President Putin really feels, and he feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election,"" Trump said at the time. ""What he believes is what he believes."" ### But since then, the Justice Department has offered significant evidence to the contrary. The latest indictments on Friday, which outlined in great detail the Kremlin's role in the election hacking, have made an already-controversial summit dramatically more so. ### As Air Force One touched down in the Finland capital, where the summer sun was still shining brightly at about 9 p.m., Trump's open arms to Putin has cast the eyes of the world on this summit."

Are you sure? ### CLOSE ### The indictments were announced Friday by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as part of the ongoing special counsel probe into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The system is blinking. It is why I believe we are at a critical point."" ### We're still under attack ### Adding, “Today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack.” ### This explains why so many people are referring to Trump’s private meeting with Putin using the hashtag #TreasonSummit. ### According to the latest indictments cyber spies working for Putin hacked into the Democratic National Committee, the Hilary Clinton campaign and other sites with the hope of turning the tide of the election against Clinton. The indictment also says that using stolen passwords, tracked keystrokes and banking information the Russians got hold of the names, addresses, partial social security numbers and drivers’ license numbers for roughly 500,000 voters. Then they used Wikileaks to spread as much negative material as they could. ### And they started doing all this on the very day that then-candidate Donald Trump asked them to do so. ### Request.

Coincidence? ### The indictments read in part: ### “For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton’s personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign.” ### That’s the day Trump said on a campaign stop, ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you can find the 33,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press."" ### It’s clear, now, that a foreign adversary launched a cyber attack to help Trump get elected. And since the election Trump has  catered and deferred to Russia and to Putin. ### Meantime, our commissars in Congress, like those four Republicans from Arizona, seem to have no problem with the Russians dictating the outcome of our elections as long as they pick the right political party. ### Partisan warfare versus ... warfare ### That’s not how it’s supposed to work. ### That can’t be how it works. ### In announcing the indictments Rosenstein said, “A partisan warfare fueled by modern technology does not fairly reflect the grace, dignity, and unity of the American people. The blame for election interference belongs to the criminals who committed election interference. We need to work together to hold the perpetrators accountable. And we need to keep moving forward to preserve our values, protect against future interference, and defend America.” ### In order to do that, Congress members must decide where they work. ### The U.S. Capitol."

It’s not a positive force, it’s a negative force.” ### The meeting comes just days after 12 Russian intelligence officers were indicted Friday in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into meddling in the 2016 US election. ### Trump indicated in an interview broadcast on CBS Sunday that he was willing to ask Putin about extraditing the officers — but then blasted the probe as “witch hunt” that has ruined the US relationship with Russia in a Twitter tirade early Monday morning . ### “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” he tweeted. ### Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted back : “We agree.” ### Trump said Sunday that he has “low expectations” for the meeting , but told reporters earlier Monday only that he thinks the meeting will go “fine,” refusing to elaborate on what they might discuss. ### Kremlin officials say Putin is expected to once again deny that any Russians meddled in the US election. ### But Putin’s spokesman said he hopes the summit is a “baby step” toward fixing the two country’s relations. ### Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told RT that there was no strict agenda but the two leaders recognize their “special responsibility” for global stability. ### He said European countries shouldn’t be worried about a possible U.S.-Russian rapprochement or decisions about Europe made “over the heads of Europeans.” ### Peskov said Putin respects Trump’s “America first” stance because he also puts Russia first, but that the only way to make progress at the summit is if both sides are open to finding areas of mutual benefit. ### With Post Wires"

Are we all so accustomed to spelunking down the rabbit hole that this barely registers? The reason Russian-American relations have been strained over the last few years is that Russia invaded and annexed Crimea , and backed rebels in Eastern Ukraine who shot down a commercial plane over European airspace , and supported genocidal dictator Bashar al-Assad—and killing civilians generally—in Syria. Oh, and they hacked and meddled in the 2016 American presidential election, which Trump just happened to win by a razor-thin margin in a few key states in the Electoral College. ### This Trumpian theme that previous presidents' posture towards Russia was some sort of arbitrary choice, rather than a response to Russian aggression, has been a constant theme in the days and hours before the summit. Here is the president's opening statement on Monday: ### WATCH: Full video of Trump's opening remarks to Putin, just before their private 90-min meeting in which no notetaker will be present. ### ""Frankly we have not been getting along very well for the last number of years... as I campaigned, getting along with Russia is a good thing."" pic.twitter.com/yoMJX208za ### — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) July 16, 2018 ### Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ### Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ### So we're just not going to mention the election hacking, which many experts suggest will undoubtedly continue into the 2018 cycle—that is to say, it's happening right now? How about the twelve Russians who were just indicted for it on Friday ? Trump now seems to acknowledge Russia interfered in 2016—if not what's happening now—but he won't challenge Putin on it. Is he afraid to? ### Instead, Trump has also devoted himself to blaming President Obama, his predecessor, for the hacking. ### President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok! ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 14, 2018 ### Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ### This seems like a good time to note it was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who blocked the Obama administration and a bipartisan group of congressional leaders from going public about Russian activity before Election Day. This is just one dimension of the insane power politics McConnell has practiced during his tenure as majority leader, which history, if we get that far, will not look kindly upon. ### The president didn't just trash Obama and yell ""witch hunt"" in the lead-up, though. He also complained about the expectations placed on him: ### Heading to Helsinki, Finland – looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia... ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 15, 2018 ### (Note that Trump is about to meet with Putin, whose critics in journalism often end up dead, and that there was a mass shooting in an American newsroom just a couple of weeks ago.

There were no principal meetings, no planning for this summit, no deeply organized strategy sessions. What is the agenda, what are the goals? What do they want to get out of it?"" ### Andrea Mitchell ( @mitchellreports ) tells us what makes this summit unique: ### ""We've never had a summit with a KGB spy master ... and a president who spent the weekend golfing."" pic.twitter.com/jfXDbSh35D ### — Kasie DC (@KasieDC) July 15, 2018 ### This level of hard work and preparation is not restricted to this event. Trump quite clearly lacks the discipline, knowledge, or attention span to perform many of the duties of his office. But in this scenario, you have to wonder whether he didn't need to worry about the agenda or the goals because they'd be given to him shortly after he shook hands with the Russian president. ### Related Story"

The topic: how CEOs actually spend their time. It’s not how you think... ### When we came across a new study in the Harvard Business Review on how CEOs spend their time, we took notice. Time is especially scarce for CEOs after all, and how they use it sends a message about their priorities and can have a direct impact on their company’s performance. ### This 12-year study is particularly important because it is the longest and most comprehensive analysis on CEOs’ time allocations to date and its authors are both rock stars. Starting in 2006, researchers Michael E. Porter (of the famous Porter Model) and Nitin Nohria (the dean of HBS) tracked the activities of 27 CEOs in 15-minute increments, 24 hours of the day for three months each. Most of the companies were public and had an average annual revenue of $13.1 billion. ### Here’s how many hours CEOs at these companies worked: ### They worked 9.7 hours per weekday on average, or 48.5 hours a week ### Each day on the weekend, they worked about 3.9 hours ### They also worked 2.4 hours a day on vacation ### 47% of their work was done at headquarters, with the balance at other “company locations, meeting external constituencies, commuting, traveling, and at home” ### Grand total: 62.5 hours a week ### What they did while working (75% of which was planned and 25% spontaneous): ### They spent 25% of their time developing people and relationships ### 25% on functional and business unit reviews ### 21% on strategy ### 72% of the time they were in meetings vs. 28% alone ### As for when they’re not working: ### They slept for 6.9 hours a night on average ### They exercised for 45 minutes a day ### They spent about 3 hours with family and 2.1 hours on downtime for things like watching TV, reading, or hobbies ### Overall, CEOs have a lot on their plate and only have a limited amount of time to get everything done. Learning how they delegate their time is an underappreciated window into how a company may perform. ### We’ll end with a few takeaways from the article: ### “How a CEO spends face-to-face time is viewed as a signal of what or who is important; people watch this more carefully than most CEOs recognize.” ### CEOs had 37 meetings a week on average that took up 72% of their total work time. Therefore, the study noted that they need to shorten meetings from their default lengths, such as down from an hour, to increase efficiency. Email also wastes time: ""CEOs should recognize that the majority of e-mails cover issues that needn't involve them and often draw them into the operational weeds."" ### CEOs need to spend more time with lower managers and rank and file employees to “keep them in touch with what is really going on in the company.” It will also help “them model and communicate organizational values throughout the workforce”. ### Additionally, CEOs in the study were surprised by how little time they spend with customers. The study highlighted how customers are a “key source of independent information about the company’s progress, industry trends, and competitors”, after all. One solution: some CEOs “systematically schedule” time with their customers. ### As for CEOs’ off time, the study said “most had learned to become very disciplined” about spending time with their family. They also needed activities to “preserve elements of normal life” to keep them “grounded and better able to engage with colleagues and workers”. Moreover, CEOs “also have to make time for their own professional renewal and development (which our data showed was often the biggest casualty of a packed schedule)”. This is important advice for any professional to remember. ### Link to the study here . ### Tags"

Here’s a look at three unavoidable topics the entire world has a vested interest in: ### ELECTION MEDDLING ### Trump, after a talk with Putin at last year’s G20 summit , assured the American people that Moscow did not intervene in the 2016 presidential election. ### This time, it won’t be so easy for Trump to take Putin’s denials at face value after a federal grand jury just indicted 12 Russian intelligence agents for a plot to hack Democratic committee officials and leak their email correspondence online. The conversation between the world leaders may get quite awkward once Trump, who originally “hadn’t thought” about asking Putin to extradite the agents, now said he “certainly” will. ### - / AFP/Getty Images ### A handout picture released by the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) on July 11, 2016 shows Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during a meeting with members of his government, in the capital Damascus. ### A handout picture released by the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) on July 11, 2016 shows Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during a meeting with members of his government, in the capital Damascus. (- / AFP/Getty Images) ### SYRIA ### Trump has already ordered two high-profile airstrikes against Syrian targets, despite warnings from Russia that the moves could bring retaliation. ### Putin continues to support the regime of Bashar al-Assad , who has allegedly used chemical weapons against his own people —including children — causing a global outcry. ### Trump could push Putin to cooperate on attempts to prevent further atrocities and assist the US in hunting down remaining ISIS forces in the region. ### UKRAINE SANCTIONS ### Last week at the NATO summit in Brussels, Trump hinted that U.S. recognition of Crimea as a Russian territory wasn’t totally out of the question as investments on the peninsula might weigh in Russia's favor. ### ""You know, people like to say, 'Oh, Crimea.' But the fact is, they built bridges to Crimea. They just opened a big bridge that was started years ago. They built, I think, a submarine port; substantially added billions of dollars,"" Trump said. ### When Russia’s military entered Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, the U.S. and several other nations launched a series of economic sanctions — most of which Putin continually protests and presents as evidence of an anti-Russia conspiracy. ### European allies are hoping Trump can pressure Putin into some kind of agreement for those sanctions to remain in place unless Russia restores the region to Ukrainian control."
6456,cnbc.com,2018-07-16T05:47:26-04:00,"Some U.S. lawmakers had pressed Trump to consider scrapping the summit altogether after 12 Russians were charged with hacking on Friday . ### The defendants, all of whom are Russian intelligence officers, were accused of launching cyber attacks on the Democratic presidential campaign in 2016. Russia has denied any collusion took place. ### Geopolitical victory ### The first official dialogue between the two global leaders will take place in Helsinki’s presidential palace on Monday, marking a symbolic end to an effort among Western allies to try to isolate Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea. ### Trump and Putin are scheduled to meet for a direct meeting with only their interpreters present, followed by a working lunch accompanied by advisors and a joint news conference. ### Officials of the White House and the Kremlin had sought to downplay expectations ahead of the summit, though Trump had predicted “maybe some good” could come of the talks. ### “Anything you do, it’s always going to be, ‘Oh Russia, he loves Russia,’” Trump said on Friday during a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. ### Meanwhile, for Putin, the fact that this summit is happening at all is seen as a geopolitical victory for Russia. That’s because talks between the U.S. and Russia could be viewed by Putin’s inner circle as evidence Washington is finally willing to recognize Moscow as a great power on the international stage. ### The Helsinki summit constitutes the final destination of an almost week-long European trip for Trump, during which he has frequently challenged traditional Western allies. ### Over the past week, Trump has sown doubts about America’s commitment to the NATO alliance, reportedly threatened to kill off a potential trade deal with the U.K. post-Brexit and described the EU as a “foe” of the world’s largest economy."

Endless media hype. Huge ratings. ### Although President Donald Trump has met with Russia's Vladimir Putin twice before, he is eager to recreate in Finland the heady experience that he had last month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore: a summit that became a mass media event complete with powerful presidential images. Ever the showman and insistent on establishing closer ties to Moscow, Trump overruled his advisers and demanded the rituals and pageantry of a formal summit. ### Trump had boasted to confidants about the number of cameras in Singapore, claiming it dwarfed coverage of the Oscars, according to a person familiar with his thinking but not authorized to discuss private conversations and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Though Trump originally expressed concern that Helsinki was not glamorous enough and favored hosting Putin at the White House, the president was reassured by aides that it would be an effective backdrop. And long believing in the power of personal connections, he has insisted to aides that it was essential to sit down with Putin to establish a rapport. ### SIGN UP ### Be the first to know. ### No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. ### SIGN ME UP! ### ""He's been very nice to me the times I've met him. I've been nice to him. He's a competitor,"" Trump said of Putin last week in Brussels. ""You know, somebody was saying, 'Is he an enemy?' No, he's not my enemy. 'Is he a friend?' No, I don't know him well enough."" ### Drawing on his experience as a marketer and salesman, Trump has long been convinced that his mastery of powerful images has been essential to his political rise. The president has told advisers that the Singapore diplomacy made him look like a take-charge president. And it was not lost on him that his poll numbers received a temporary bump after the meeting. ### ___ ### What Trump and Putin hope to achieve at Helsinki summit ### HELSINKI (AP) — The outcome of the first summit between the unpredictable first-term American president and Russia's steely-eyed longtime leader is anybody's guess. With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ___ ### Young Nubians revive dream of returning to land in Egypt ### ASWAN, Egypt (AP) — The world of their parents and grandparents was turned upside down more than 50 years ago when they were evacuated from villages along the Nile River to make way for the High Dam. Now a younger generation has revived the long-dormant cause of Egypt's Nubians, campaigning for a return to their lands and struggling to preserve their culture. ### Their timing could not have been worse. ### Recent peaceful marches by Nubians were met by swift suppression from the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, which has shown little tolerance for dissent. To a state dominated by the military and security agencies, Nubians' assertion of their distinct identity and heritage amid the Arab majority looks like a threat to stability. ### ""This country has so many colors and ethnicities, and it is so destructive that we are trying to give it just one identity,"" said Fatmah Imam, a Nubian activist born and raised in Cairo. Even during her days at university, she recalled, the message instilled was that the country should be homogeneous. ### ""It is painful for me that I am unable to manifest my identity,"" she said. ""I see Egypt as a mosaic."" ### ___ ### S. Korea probes army plan for troops to control protesters ### SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A group of army generals rolling tanks and troops into Seoul to seize power. Paratroopers firing at large crowds calling for democracy. Tanks and armored vehicles stationed at universities to intimidate student protesters. ### Such scenes of military intervention in South Korea have been nonexistent since the country achieved democracy in the late 1980s. But revelations this past week of a document showing the military drafted plans to mobilize troops to suppress protests last year have struck a nerve among people in one of Asia's most vibrant and wealthiest democracies. Some allege the plans even included a scenario for a coup. ### The memories of brutal, military-backed dictatorships that imprisoned, tortured and executed dissidents remain vivid to many South Koreans. But most experts say the actual chances for another coup in South Korea are extremely low. A look at the explosive revelations and why a coup is nearly impossible to pull off today: ### ___ ### ___ ### US judge criticizes plan to reunify families split at border ### SAN DIEGO (AP) — A federal judge, responding to a plan to reunify children separated at the border, said he was having second thoughts about his belief that the Trump administration was acting in good faith to comply with his orders. ### The Justice Department on Friday filed a plan to reunify more than 2,500 children age 5 and older by a court-imposed deadline of July 26 using ""truncated"" procedures to verify parentage and perform background checks, which exclude DNA testing and other steps it took to reunify children under 5. ### The administration said the abbreviated vetting puts children at significant safety risk but is needed to meet the deadline. ### Chris Meekins, deputy assistant Health and Human Services secretary for preparedness and response, filed a declaration that he is fully committed to meeting the deadline. However, he does not believe ""the placing of children into such situations is consistent with the mission of HHS or my core values."" ### U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw took umbrage at Meekins' statement, disputing the official's interpretation of his orders and saying that safe reunification could and will occur by July 26. ### ___ ### Trump's remarks about changing European culture draw ire ### WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's lament this week that immigration is ""changing the culture"" of Europe echoed rising anti-immigrant feelings on both sides of the Atlantic, where Europe and the United States are going through a demographic transformation that makes some of the white majority uncomfortable. ### Historians and advocates immediately denounced Trump's comments, saying such talk would encourage white nationalists. ### ""The way he put this argument about changing our culture ... about Europe becoming less nice than it is, in other words, these people are here and they are making the culture crappy and making the place lesser, that's straight out of the white supremacist/white nationalist playbook,"" said Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project. ### Trump, in an interview with the British newspaper The Sun, blamed immigration for a changing culture in Europe: ""I think allowing millions and millions of people to come into Europe is very, very sad. I think you are losing your culture. Look around. You go through certain areas that didn't exist ten or 15 years ago."" ### Trump, the grandson of a German immigrant and the son of a Scottish immigrant to the United States, repeated his contention at a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May: ### ___ ### US official: Russia using social media to divide Americans ### PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The U.S. homeland security secretary said on Saturday there are no signs that Russia is targeting this year's midterm elections with the same ""scale or scope"" it targeted the 2016 presidential election. ### Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen spoke at a convention of state secretaries of state, an event that's usually a low-key affair highlighting voter registration, balloting devices and election security issues that don't get much public attention. But coming amid fresh allegations into Russia's attempts to sway the 2016 election, the sessions on election security have a higher level of urgency and interest. ### Nielsen said her agency will help state and local election officials prepare their systems for cyberattacks from Russia or elsewhere. She said U.S. intelligence officials are seeing ""persistent Russian efforts using social media, sympathetic spokespeople and other fronts to sow discord and divisiveness amongst the American people, though not necessarily focused on specific politicians or political campaigns."" ### The conference of top state election officials she addressed was sandwiched between Friday's indictments of 12 Russian military intelligence officers alleged to have hacked into Democratic party and campaign accounts and Monday's long-awaited meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### Trump has never condemned Russia over meddling in the 2016 election despite the findings of all top U.S. intelligence agencies, and the Kremlin has insisted it didn't meddle in the U.S. election. In the past, Trump has reiterated Putin's denials, but this week he said he would bring up the issue when they meet on Monday in Finland. ### ___ ### Angry crowd protests after Chicago police fatally shoot man ### CHICAGO (AP) — An angry crowd shouted and threw bottles at Chicago police after an officer fatally shot a man on the city's South Side Saturday, prompting the arrest of at least four demonstrators. ### Chicago police patrol chief Fred Waller told a news conference that the man was shot in the South Shore neighborhood after police officers on foot tried to question him because ""the bulge around his waistband"" suggested he was armed. The man became combative and eventually broke free from the officers, Waller said. ### ""They thought he appeared to be reaching for a weapon, which he did have a weapon on him, and the officers tragically shot him,"" he said. ### The unidentified man was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Waller said police believe the man did not have a concealed carry permit for the semi-automatic weapon. He also had magazines of ammunition, Waller said. ### Immediately after the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and began jostling with police, who had cordoned off the area. Waller said protesters threw bottles and jumped on top of a squad car. Police then moved in wielding batons to stop them. ### ___ ### Russian women push back at shaming over World Cup dating ### MOSCOW (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of foreign men have flooded into Russia for the monthlong World Cup, setting off a fierce debate in the host nation about the roles and rights of women. ### Russian women who have dated the soccer fans have been shamed by some Russian commentators, denounced for allegedly undermining the country's morals and gene pool. ### The widespread, vehement criticism has shown the dominance of patriarchal and sexist views in Russia, where the concept of gender equality is a generation behind that of the West's. ### Still, the reaction against Russian women's World Cup dalliances has been so strong that some feminists in Russia think it could actually advance their cause by shocking even conservative women who wouldn't identify themselves as feminists. ### ""Even those women (are saying) 'Enough is enough, you've gone too far!"" feminist writer Snezhana Gribatskaya said. ### ___ ### Haiti's prime minister resigns amid fuel price hike fallout ### PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Haitian Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant resigned Saturday amid calls for him to step down over his handling of a failed plan to raise fuel prices that set off a wave of deadly protests. ### Lafontant told Haiti's Chamber of Deputies that he sent President Jovenel Moise his resignation letter. Moise confirmed via Twitter that he had accepted Lafontant's resignation along with those of other Cabinet members. ### The prime minister's abrupt resignation came ahead of a vote on a motion of censure Lafontant, a first step toward asking that Moise name a new prime minister to form a Cabinet to handle the crisis. The prime minister is the second highest official in Haiti after the president. ### Lafontant was to answer questions about the July 6-8 riots that followed the government's attempt to raise fuel prices by up to 51 percent as part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. At least seven people were killed and dozens of businesses were looted during the unrest. ### Instead, Lafontant (LA-FAH-TON) used the opportunity to announce his resignation, while in various parts of Haiti's small protests were held demanding the head of state step down."

Add your two cents. ### Throughout the day before the summit in Helsinki, the lead story on the New York Times home page stayed the same: “Just by Meeting With Trump, Putin Comes Out Ahead.” The Sunday headline was in harmony with the tone of U.S. news coverage overall. As for media commentary, the Washington Post was in the dominant groove as it editorialized that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin is “an implacably hostile foreign adversary.” ### Contempt for diplomacy with Russia is now extreme. Mainline U.S. journalists and top Democrats often bait President Trump in zero-sum terms. No doubt Hillary Clinton thought she was sending out an applause line in her  tweet  Sunday night: “Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?” ### A bellicose stance toward Russia has become so routine and widespread that we might not give it a second thought — and that makes it all the more hazardous. After President George W. Bush declared “You’re either with us or against us,” many Americans gradually realized what was wrong with a Manichean view of the world. Such an outlook is even more dangerous today. ### Since early 2017, the U.S. mass media have laid it on thick with the rough political equivalent of a painting technique known as chiaroscuro — “the use of strong contrasts between light and dark, usually bold contrasts affecting a whole composition,” in the words of Wikipedia. The Russiagate frenzy is largely about punching up contrasts between the United States (angelic and victimized) and Russia (sinister and victimizer). ### Countless stories with selective facts are being told that way. But other selectively fact-based stories could also be told to portray the United States as a sinister victimizer and Russia as an angelic victim. Those governments and their conformist media outlets are relentless in telling it either way. As the great journalist  I.F. Stone  observed long ago, “All governments lie, and nothing they say should be believed.” In other words: don’t trust, verify. ### Often the biggest lies involve what remains unsaid. For instance, U.S. media rarely mention such key matters as the promise-breaking huge expansion of NATO to Russia’s borders since the fall of the Berlin Wall, or the  brazen U.S. intervention  in Russia’s pivotal 1996 presidential election, or the U.S. government’s 2002 withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, or the more than 800 U.S. military bases overseas — in contrast to Russia’s nine. ### For human survival on this planet, an overarching truth appears in an open letter published last week by The Nation magazine: “No political advantage, real or imagined, could possibly compensate for the consequences if even a fraction of U.S. and Russian arsenals were to be utilized in a thermonuclear exchange. The tacit pretense that the worsening of U.S.-Russian relations does not worsen the odds of survival for the next generations is profoundly false.” ### The initial 26 signers of the open letter — “ Common Ground: For Secure Elections and True National Security ” — included Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, writer and feminist organizer Gloria Steinem, former UN ambassador Gov. Bill Richardson, political analyst Noam Chomsky, former covert CIA operations officer Valerie Plame, activist leader Rev. Dr. William Barber II, filmmaker Michael Moore, former Nixon White House counsel John Dean, Russia scholar Stephen F. Cohen, former U.S. ambassador to the USSR Jack F. Matlock Jr., Pulitzer Prize-winning writers Alice Walker and Viet Thanh Nguyen, The Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel, former senator Adlai Stevenson III, and former longtime House Armed Services Committee member Patricia Schroeder. (I was also one of the initial signers.) ### Since its release five days ago, the open letter has gained support from a  petition  already signed by 30,000 people. The petition campaign aims to amplify the call for protecting the digital infrastructure of the electoral process that is now “vulnerable to would-be hackers based anywhere” — and for taking “concrete steps… to ease tensions between the nuclear superpowers.” ### We need a major shift in the U.S. approach toward Russia. Clearly the needed shift won’t be initiated by the Republican or Democratic leaders in Congress; it must come from Americans who make their voices heard. The lives — and even existence — of future generations are at stake in the relationship between Washington and Moscow. ### Many of the petition’s grassroots signers have posted comments along with their names. Here are a few of my favorites: ### *  From Nevada: “We all share the same planet! We better learn how to do it safely or face the consequences of blowing ourselves up!” ### *  From New Mexico: “The earth will not survive a nuclear war. The weapons we have today are able to cause much more destruction than those of previous eras. We must find a way to common ground.” ### *  From Massachusetts: “It is imperative that we take steps to protect the sanctity of our elections and to prevent nuclear war anywhere on the earth.” ### *  From Kentucky: “Secure elections are a fundamental part of a democratic system. But this could become meaningless in the event of thermonuclear war.” ### *  From California: “There is only madness and hubris in talk of belligerence toward others, especially when we have such dangerous weapons and human error has almost led to our annihilation already more than once in the past half-century.” ### Yet a wide array of media outlets, notably the  “Russiagate”-obsessed  network  MSNBC , keeps egging on progressives to climb toward peaks of anti-Russian jingoism. The line of march is often in virtual lockstep with GOP hyper-hawks like Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. The incessant drumbeat is in sync with what Martin Luther King Jr. called “the madness of militarism. ### Meanwhile, as Dr. King said, “We still have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent coannihilation.” ### We encourage you to Share our Reports, Analyses, Breaking News and Videos.

His national security adviser said they aren't looking for ""concrete deliverables."" ### Trump also tells CBS News in an interview conducted Saturday that he ""hadn't thought"" about asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in Washington on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ### But after being given the idea by his interviewer, Trump said ""certainly I'll be asking about it."" ### He blamed the Democratic National Committee for ""allowing themselves to be hacked"" by Russians trying to help elect him. ### The U.S. has no extradition treaty with Moscow and can't compel Russia to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens to foreign countries. ### Asked whether Trump would ask Putin to turn over the 12 military intelligence officials, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton called the idea ""pretty silly"" and said doing so would put the president in a ""weak position."" ### He said Trump goes into the summit with a stronger hand because of the indictments. ### ""I think the president can put this on the table and say, 'This is a serious matter that we need to talk about,'"" Bolton said. He said asking for the indicted Russians to be turned over would have the opposite effect. ### ""For the president to demand something that isn't going to happen puts the president in a weak position, and I think the president has made it very clear he intends to approach this discussion from a position of strength."" ### In the CBS News interview, Trump said he's entering the Helsinki summit with ""low expectations. I'm not going with high expectations."" He declined to discuss his goals, but said such sessions are beneficial. He cited his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June as a ""good thing,"" along with meetings he's had with Chinese President Xi Jinping. ### ""Nothing bad is going to come out of it (Helsinki), and maybe some good will come out,"" Trump said. ### He described the European Union, a bloc of nation's that includes many of America's closest allies, as a ""foe."" ### ""I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,"" Trump said, adding that ""you wouldn't think of the European Union but they're a foe."" ### He said Russia is a foe ""in certain respects"" and that China is a foe ""economically ... but that doesn't mean they are bad. It doesn't mean anything. It means that they are competitive."" Trump has been reluctant to criticize Putin over the years and has described him as a competitor in recent days. ### Trump said he respects Europe's leaders but adds that they've taken advantage of the U.S. on trade and defense spending. ### The president sat for the interview Saturday in Scotland and CBS News released excerpts on Sunday, hours before Trump flew to Helsinki. From aboard Air Force One, Trump called the U.S. news media ""the enemy of the people"" as he headed to sit down with Putin, who has cracked down on the press at home. ### Trump complained that ""No matter how well I do at the Summit"" he'll face ""criticism that it wasn't good enough."" ### ""If I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough — that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" he tweeted. ### Trump also said: ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people."" ### Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some Russian journalists. Trump regularly criticizes American news media outlets and has called out some journalists by name. ### Trump and Putin have held talks twice before. Their first meeting came last July while both participated in an international summit and continued for more than two hours, well over the scheduled 30 minutes. The leaders also met last fall during a separate summit in Vietnam. ### But Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, said Monday's meeting ""is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation and I hope it's a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests."" ### Congressional Democrats and at least one Republican have called on Trump to pull out of Monday's meeting unless he is willing to make Russian election-meddling the top issue. Huntsman said the summit must go on because Russian engagement is needed to solve some international issues. ### ""The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off-the-charts high so it's a good thing these presidents are getting together,"" he said. ### Trump has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling, along with Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation and other topics. Bolton described the meeting as ""unstructured"" and said: ""We're not looking for concrete deliverables here."" ### Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., rejected Bolton's assertion that the indictments put Trump in a stronger position going in to the meeting. ### ""He has already said that he has asked Putin about meddling, Putin told him he didn't do it, and he believed him,"" Murphy said. ""And so it just belies common sense that the president of the United States, this president, is going to sit down across from Putin and press him hard on the issue of Russian meddling."" ### Putin has denied meddling in the election. ### Sen.

6521,seattletimes.com,2018-07-16T09:11:14-04:00,"Trump-Putin summit underway, after Trump faults U.S. ‘stupidity’ for poor relations with Russia ### Originally published July 16, 2018 at 2:14 am ### Updated July 16, 2018 at 5:56 am ### Share story ### Seung-Min Kim ### The Washington Post ### HELSINKI — President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met here Monday for their first formal one-on-one summit, firmly shaking hands hours after Trump began the day by blaming his own country, rather than Russia, for the hostilities between their two nations. ### Seated alongside Putin, Trump began by congratulating Russia on successfully hosting the World Cup soccer tournament, which concluded Sunday, then noted that the United States and Russia have “not been getting along too well” in recent years. He said he hoped that would change and that “I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship.” ### “Getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing,” Trump said, as Putin slouched in his chair. Trump added that the “world wants to see us getting along.” ### Trump said he and Putin have a “lot of good things to talk about, and things to talk about,” including trade, military issues, nuclear proliferation and China, in particular their “mutual friend,” Chinese President Xi Jinping. ### Most Read Nation & World Stories ### Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. ### Trump did not mention Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential campaign as one of the topics to be discussed. ### Putin, who spoke before Trump made his opening remarks, said to the U.S. president: “Of course, the time has come that we speak extensively about our bilateral relations and various problem points around the world. There are enough of them that we ought to pay attention to them.” ### The meeting began later than originally planned, after the perennially tardy Putin arrived in Helsinki well behind schedule, keeping Trump waiting. ### Although most U.S. officials argue that Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, use of a nerve agent on British soil and aggression in Ukraine and Syria have worsened relations, Trump instead faulted “U.S. foolishness and stupidity” in tweets Monday morning, as well as the expansive Justice Department investigation into Russia’s election intrusion. ### “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” Trump tweeted Monday morning as he prepared for his meeting with Putin. ### Trump is facing immense pressure to aggressively confront Putin over Russia’s election interference, especially after the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officials Friday and charged them with hacking and stealing Democratic emails, as part of a broad subterfuge operation that U.S. intelligence agencies believe was ordered by Putin to help elect Trump. ### But Trump’s comments Monday were in sync with the argument Putin and his government have long made, which is that the policies of the Obama administration — as well as the investigation into election interference, which Putin repeatedly has denied — inflamed tensions between the two nuclear superpowers. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s official Twitter account retweeted Trump’s “U.S. foolishness and stupidity” tweet and said, “We agree.” ### Trump — who has been reticent to criticize Putin and has said he admires the Russian autocrat’s leadership style and strongman image — began their meeting shortly after 2 p.m. (4 a.m. Eastern time) at the Presidential Palace, a neoclassical residence facing Helsinki’s heavily touristed Baltic Sea waterfront. They were originally scheduled to meet at 1 p.m. here (6 a.m. ET). ### But Putin arrived later than expected in Helsinki on Monday and did not disembark from his plane until after 1 p.m., delaying the scheduled start time of the summit. Putin is known for his frequent tardiness; he once made President Barack Obama wait 45 minutes for one of their meetings. ### The two leaders first were meeting alone, with interpreters present but without their advisers, for 90 minutes. They then will be joined by their delegations for a working lunch, followed by a joint press availability. Trump then will fly home to Washington. ### Trump is joined in Helsinki by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, chief of staff John F. Kelly and other advisers, including National Security Council Russia expert Fiona Hill. ### Earlier in his Europe trip, Trump told reporters he would raise the election interference issue with Putin, although he indicated that he would not be too stern, saying he assumes Putin will deny responsibility, and then they would move on to other topics. ### In another Monday morning tweet, Trump sought to pin blame for the matter on Obama. ### “President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!” Trump wrote, referencing first 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and then FBI agent Peter Strzok, who testified before Congress in a combative hearing last week. ### Trump arrived with first lady Melania Trump in Helsinki late Sunday, after spending the weekend golfing at his property in Scotland. Aboard Air Force One, the president aired some of his grievances on Twitter ahead of his upcoming summit with Putin. ### “Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough — that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” Trump wrote. ### And after a week of denigrating the U.S. news media on foreign soil, Trump continued in his tweetstorm: “Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct! This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country — but at some point, it will heal!” ### Trump began his day Monday in this Nordic capital by meeting Finnish President Sauli Niinisto for breakfast, along with their wives. When a reporter asked about his message for Putin, Trump replied, “We’ll do just fine.” ### Trump also touted the unity of NATO, saying the treaty alliance of 29 nations that is a Western bulwark against an expansionist Russia, has “never been stronger than it is today.” ### Last week in Brussels, Trump upended the NATO summit with demands that European allies increase their defense spending commitments. On Monday in Helsinki, Trump claimed credit for forcing the hands of his counterparts. “It was a little bit tough at the beginning,” he said, “but it turned out to be love.” ### Putin had been set to land in Helsinki around noon local time with fresh momentum after presiding over the World Cup final in Moscow, a tournament that many observers – including Trump – hailed as a success. ### Beyond spreading a positive image of Russia, the World Cup also gave Putin a chance to exercise his diplomatic chops ahead of the Helsinki summit amid a revolving door of visiting world leaders. On Sunday alone, Putin met with French President Emmanuel Macron; Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban; Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic; and Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. ### Last week, Putin separately received Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stoking speculation that Putin would discuss Iran’s presence in Syria with Trump. ### Russian officials have kept expectations low, emphasizing that the very fact of the meeting is an important step forward after years of tensions between Moscow and Washington. Ahead the summit, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov praised Trump’s pragmatism in an interview with pro-Kremlin broadcaster RT. ### “Our president is very pragmatic, very open and consistent,” Peskov said, referring to Putin, according to the Interfax news agency. “He always says that the interests of Russia and the people of Russia are the main thing to him. And therefore he respects the fact that Donald Trump has the same attitude to his country.” ### For Putin, the setting of the summit provides something of a home-turf advantage. Although Finland is a member of the European Union and is a neutral nation, it borders Russia and is familiar to Putin, as Helsinki is just up the Bay of Finland from his hometown of St. Petersburg. ### This vibrant Nordic capital, which in the summertime glistens with sunlight late into the evening, holds significant resonance for U.S.-Russia affairs as a neutral site for leaders of the two countries to meet. ### In 1990, then-President George H.W. Bush met in Helsinki with then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to show a unified front against then-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein amid escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf. And in 1997, then-President Bill Clinton and then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin held a two-day summit here to discuss arms control and the addition of former Soviet countries to NATO. ### Trump has said he has low expectations for Monday’s summit with Putin and heads into it without the kind of pre-scripted outcomes typical at such international meetings. Rather, he sees the meeting as a chance to build a better rapport with Putin and foster warmer relations between the United States and Russia. ### “Right now, there’s no trust in the relationship, and because of that, problem-solving is practically impossible,” U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “So this is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama, and quite frankly some of the danger, out of the relationship right now.” ### Trump and his advisers have sought to temper expectations for the summit, which is expected to include discussions over the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, a Reagan-era arms-control agreement and the prospect of extending a 2011 nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia. ### The president declined to outline his objectives in an interview with CBS News in advance of the summit, and his advisers have said the mere act of holding the direct meeting with Putin is a “deliverable.” ### Back in Washington, lawmakers from both parties have implored Trump to aggressively confront Putin. ### “President Trump should have only one message for Putin [on Monday]: Quit messing with America,” Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said on Twitter early Monday, arguing that Trump should not be “dignifying” the Russian president by granting a meeting. ### Clinton tweeted, “Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?” ### Putin’s allies say that last Friday’s indictments represented the latest effort by the Washington establishment to derail Trump’s effort to improve relations with Russia. ### “It seems to us the opponents of the improvement of U.S.-Russia relations should not be allowed to endlessly exploit this harmful topic, which is being kept afloat artificially,” Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said ahead of the summit, according to Interfax. ### This story was originally published at washingtonpost.com.

6548,slate.com,2018-07-16T10:55:13-04:00," ### Much of the analysis following special counsel Robert Mueller’s Friday indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers has focused on their alleged conspiracy to hack into Clinton campaign and Democratic Party computers and email systems during the 2016 election, and on questions about coordination between then-candidate Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russian infiltrators. ### But the indictment also included new revelations about the extent of Russia’s attacks on our election systems in 2016—and those details provide a warning that we need to get serious about preparing for even more damaging attacks in this year’s midterms. ### The latest indictment alleges that Russian intelligence officers hacked into the website of a yet-unidentified state board of elections. Among other new information, it alleges Russia used that hack to steal information related to 500,000 voters. That figure’s surprising. We already know that hackers targeted election systems in 21 states and allegedly hacked into the computers of a private U.S. elections systems vendor . (The indictment did not name the vendor, but details seem to match a reported hack of the company VR Systems ; VR Systems has denied any breach had occurred.) But, thus far, officials have only confirmed that databases from the Illinois election systems had ever actually been compromised. What’s more, reports previously indicated the records of only about 100,000 voters had been accessed in the Illinois breach. That means the reach of Russia’s infiltration of election systems likely went deeper than we’d understood. ### The truth is: We can never have 100 percent unhackable elections. ### Perhaps most importantly, as Wired’s Kim Zetter identifies , the indictments suggest the Russians’ attack against U.S. election infrastructure may have been an afterthought. The indictment puts the research and execution of the state board of election and vendor attacks in June through October of 2016—well into the election, and months after the initial hacks of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign. As she notes, we would be wise to assume future attacks will involve more advanced planning. Combine this with the fact that the Russians undoubtedly learned information from their 2016 efforts, and there is reason to believe future attacks on our election infrastructure could be far more damaging. ### The good news is that many officials tasked with protecting our election infrastructure take this threat seriously. Election officials, the Department of Homeland Security, and the federal Election Assistance Commission have all been working diligently to ensure they can catch and prevent future attempts to breach election infrastructure. Congress has provided states with $380 million to increase election system security. A new government coordinating council now allows the federal government and local election officials to share information like never before. And many states have made serious investments in new security. ### This is critical work, but it’s not enough. The truth is: We can never have 100 percent unhackable elections. If Russian intelligence agencies (or other foreign powers) have decided that they want to make a concerted effort to attack our elections, they will, at some point, be successful. ### The single most important thing states and counties can do in the next few months is to ensure that every polling place in the country has contingency plans in place to deal with a successful breach. That means ensuring that, in spite of a successful attack, people can vote on Election Day, and we have a way of ensuring all of those votes will eventually be counted accurately. ### To start, it’s worth focusing on three critical election systems that cyberattackers are most likely to target—and to look at some of the actions that local jurisdictions should take to detect and recover from successful attacks against them. ### Electronic poll books: Thirty-two states use e–poll books, usually in the form of mobile computers or tablets, that allow poll workers to digitally look up voters’ registration information instead of manually searching through paper lists of names. Most e–poll books come equipped with technology that allows them to communicate with, at minimum, nearby e–poll book units in the same polling location to share real-time voter check-in information. E–poll books may communicate this information over wired or wireless network connections. But e–poll books that communicate over wireless networks present unique security challenges because, unlike a wired network, a wireless network can be monitored and attacked from a distance. ### While the indictment doesn’t allege that e–poll books were hacked in the 2016 election, there’s reason to believe they could be an enticing target for hackers. If a jurisdiction is unprepared for e–poll book failures, voters could be told they are not registered or forced to wait for hours to vote while election officials scramble to fix the e–poll books or locate and print paper backups. ### For jurisdictions using this technology, there are two important steps to take to curtail a potential hack. First, they should limit or eliminate wireless connectivity, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, to decrease the risk of a successful attack. Second, election officials should ensure that every polling place using e–poll books on Election Day also has backup printed paper poll books on hand in the event of a real or suspected e–poll book failure (something that’s not just helpful in the case of a hack but also for run-of-the-mill software and device glitches ). Currently, only 17 states of the 32 states using e–poll books require backup paper poll books on Election Day. ### Voter registration systems: The voter registration system maintains the official list of registered voters, including individuals’ names, phone numbers, addresses, district assignment information, and, in some states, political party affiliation. Mueller’s indictments confirm that voter registration systems were indeed a target of the Russians in 2016. Though the only substantial successful hack we know of involved stealing basic voter registration info (likely names, addresses, and the last four digits of Social Security numbers in the case of the Illinois). But other types of breaches could present potential nightmare scenarios. Imagine hackers could somehow delete or change voter registration information, so voters would show up at the polls only to find their names missing or registered to the wrong precinct. Or nimble hackers might make it impossible for election officials to access certain voter files when it comes time to create new poll books. ### To ensure such attacks would not disrupt an election, officials should download an electronic copy of the voter information on a daily basis. This will allow them to reconstruct a list should they discover a hack and to access a list if the official database becomes unavailable at any point. ### Officials should also ensure that every polling place has enough provisional ballots to last through at least two hours of peak voting time, so that if necessary, they can print and deliver more as needed without forcing voters to wait. Federal law requires that polling places provide provisional ballots , which allow an individual to record a vote even in the event poll workers can’t find the individual’s names on a registration list. These paper ballots are only counted if election officials can later confirm that the individual was eligible to vote at that polling place. In the event of a hack, provisional ballots would ensure that individuals are able to cast a ballot while providing election officials additional time to determine eligibility using backup lists. ### Voting machines: There are no allegations in the Mueller indictments that Russians targeted voting machines in the 2016 election. Nevertheless, this is obviously a critical system to protect from cyberattacks. There are many steps jurisdictions should be taking to ensure that hackers cannot reach voting machines in a way that impacts the integrity of the election. Among those: conducting pre-election “logic and accuracy” testing for every machine. This is akin to running a mini-election on each machine before it’s put in use, to ensure each machine is counting votes accurately. ### After the election is over, but before results are certified, jurisdictions should also conduct post-election audits. For polling places in about two-thirds of the country, this means comparing a manual count of the paper ballots voters cast to the tally generated by the digital scanners that most of these jurisdictions employ to read said paper ballots. For polling places that use direct-recording electronic voting machines—which allow individuals to log votes by manually touching a screen, monitor, or other device—this means assuring these machines include “voter-verified paper audit trails.” These paper printouts provide a permanent record of the votes cast by the individual and give voters the opportunity to review a paper record of their choices before casting their ballots. ### Unfortunately, 13 states are still using at least some direct-recording electronic voting machines that have no paper trail as their primary polling place equipment, making audits in these states impossible. These machines should be replaced as soon as possible. Come November, it’s also critical for any states using any kind of electronic voting machines to have emergency paper ballots that can be deployed immediately in case machines breakdown—whether that breakdown is caused by a system failure or hack. ### All of the steps discussed above are critical not just to detect and recover from a hack against our election infrastructure but to instill greater public confidence in our election systems more generally.  As of now, it doesn’t look like Russians altered or erased any voter registrations, meddled with any polling places, or changed any votes in the 2016 election. But they were also after another central goal: to cast doubt on the integrity of American democratic systems and institutions. Regardless of their ability to successfully hack election systems in the future, we still need to keep wary of the discord even suspicion of such sabotage can sow. Election officials who adopt strong contingency plans, and make those plans known to their voters, can help reassure citizens that, regardless of what threats we face, voters will be able to cast ballots that will be accurately counted. ### To be sure, the 2018 midterms could go off without a hitch. But instead of wishful thinking, states and counties need to hope for the best but prepare for the worst."

6618,beforeitsnews.com,2018-07-16T01:49:26-04:00,"Getting the Russian relationship right ### Sunday, July 15, 2018 22:35 ### % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents. ### This week Mr Trump meets Mr Putin. I want the President to be realistic about Russian behaviour and how we need to respond. It would be good if  relations improve rather than a further deterioration with threats on both sides, without compromising important principles. Mr Trump may well wish to announce  new practical working approaches despite the differences. ### The current UK government has been at the tough end of western attitudes towards Russia, in part owing to the poisonings in Salisbury. Of course killing people with nerve agents must be condemned strongly and my heart goes out to the families affected. Our relationship with Russia is, however, a complex one. The government and NATO  work in  close contact with the Russian authorities when acting militarily against Isis.  That makes sense, but reminds us how there are few absolutes in relations between important countries.  Germany, part of NATO, has made herself very dependent on Russian gas, as Mr Trump pointed out. Events and circumstances can change, and diplomacy needs to respond. A country has a range of interests. These can require agreements with countries that have very different values and behaviours and may need to reshape old alliances. We do have friendly working relations with a number of countries with whom we have profound disagreements on human rights and government behaviours. ### Russia is a dominant power in the Middle East. President Obama’s decision to limit US force in the region and to stay out of much of the Syrian war has ensured growing Russian influence. President Trump has not changed this policy, though he has taken specific action over chemical weapons use. Given this development the USA, UK and other NATO allies co-operate closely with the Russian military where Russia does hold sway. and need to do so to avoid inadvertent clashes. ### Russia upset the EU through its actions in Crimea. This led to sanctions and tough words. The western allies however are not going to try to prize Crimea apart from Russia by force, so at some stage there needs to be discussions about how to proceed despite  this dispute. Russia would say the bulk of the people of Crimea want to be Russian, so under the doctrine of self determination it makes sense. The West says there was no internationally approved referendum to test opinion and make this decision. The EU needs to watch to see what if anything the President says on this matter, as we need to avoid a major split on the subject between the USA and the European NATO members."

Undeterred, the American president is set to go face-to-face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### Trump, who has been trying to lower expectations about what the meeting will achieve, told reporters during a breakfast Monday morning with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompting a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a witch hunt. ### Trump continued to undermine the investigation in a series of tweets from Helsinki before the meeting, blaming it for fraying U.S.-Russian relations. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,"" he wrote, blaming ""many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" ### He also continued to blame his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election in his favor, claiming that when Obama ""was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it."" ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV spectacle that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin's primary mission was simply to have the summit happen. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one-on-one in the Finnish presidential palace's opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will then take questions at a press conference before going their separate ways. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow's attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America's closest allies, as a ""foe."" ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump's jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over ""delinquent"" defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### ""NATO is now strong & rich!"" Trump wrote in a celebratory tweet Monday morning. During his breakfast, he said NATO had ""never been more together"" and said the summit had been ""a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love."" ### Ahead of his sit-down with with Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump has continued to unleash a series of attacks on the media, including as Air Force One descended into Helsinki. ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" Trump tweeted. ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!"" ### ""Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, ""not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime."" ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week — another chaotic stop on his European tour — that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said ""certainly I'll be asking about it"" although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can't force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a ""shameful comedy"" staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn't contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria's border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia's carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level."

With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ""I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,"" Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### ""The fact that we're having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,"" said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. ""What is important here is that we start a discussion."" ### Trump has been drawn to the spectacle of the summit and has expressed an eagerness to recreate in Helsinki the media show of last month's Singapore summit when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Even as many NATO leaders made supportive noises this week, the Helsinki summit has raised fears in many global capitals that Trump will pull back from traditional Western alliances, allowing Putin to expand his sphere of influence. ### Back home, too, there is wariness on Capitol Hill, with a number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans urging Trump to cancel the summit in the wake of the explosive indictments. ### But Trump has vowed that he can handle Putin, whom he has taken to referring to as a ""competitor"" rather than an adversary. ### And Trump in recent days has outlined some of the items he'd like to discuss, including Ukraine. Though the president has said he was ""not happy"" about Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, he puts the blame on his predecessor and says he will continue relations with Putin even if Moscow refuses to return the peninsula. ### Trump also said he and Putin would discuss the ongoing war in Syria and arms control, negotiations that White House officials have signaled could be fruitful. ### ""I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,"" the president said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. ""We've been modernizing and fixing and buying.  And it's just a devastating technology.  And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it's a very, very bad policy."" ### But it is the matter of election meddling, including fears Russia could try to interfere in the midterm elections this fall, that could play a central role in the summit talks or loom even larger if not addressed. In neither of Trump's previous meetings with Putin — informal talks on the sidelines of summits last year in Germany and Vietnam — did the president publicly upbraid the Russian leader, prompting questions about whether he believed the former KGB officer's denials over his own intelligence agencies' assessments of meddling. ### Trump repeatedly has cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking of his Democratic rivals and disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise it with Putin even as he downplayed its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think.  But you never know what happens, right?  But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### WHAT PUTIN WANTS ### For Putin, sitting down with Trump offers a long-awaited chance to begin repairing relations with Washington after years of spiraling tensions. ### Putin wants the U.S. and its allies to lift sanctions, pull back NATO forces deployed near Russia's borders and restore business as usual with Moscow. In the longer run, he hopes to persuade the U.S. to acknowledge Moscow's influence over its former Soviet neighbors and, more broadly, recognize Russia as a global player whose interests must be taken into account. ### These are long-term goals, and Putin realizes that no significant progress will come from just one meeting. More than anything else, he sees Monday's summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### ""Russia-U.S. ties aren't just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. ""It's unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don't meet."" ### Moscow views Trump's criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump's election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament's upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won't engage in vague talk about ""illusory subjects,"" such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia's return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he's likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be ""pointless"" to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea's status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine's push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### ""Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,"" Lukyanov said. ""But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident."" ### Isachenkov reported from Moscow. ### © Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He has charmed him and egged him on. And on Monday, when Russian President Vladimir Putin meets President Donald Trump face to face here in Finland's capital, he will see what he gets out of it. ### Coming into Monday's one-on-one summit, Trump faces intense pressure back home to confront Putin over Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, especially in the wake of Friday's indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers for hacking and releasing Democratic emails. ### In Washington and throughout the West, leaders are also pressing Trump to hold firm in countering Putin's intervention in Syria and Ukraine by refusing to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea. ### But Trump's week-long tour through Europe only served to underscore his common ground with Putin more than their differences. In Belgium and in the United Kingdom, Trump echoed Putin's ideological worldview and his political posture - from decrying immigration patterns that he said were destroying European culture to assaulting the media as ""fake news"" and blaming the U.S. ""deep state"" and a ""rigged witch hunt"" investigation for the poor condition of U.S.-Russian relations.                    Trump said on Twitter. ""The weather is beautiful, and this place is incredible! Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin.""      Trump moved calmly inside as the parachute approached, surrounded by his security detail. British police said they were trying to trace the pilot.                             He also asked where the Democratic National Committee server now was.   ""Why didn’t the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?"" Trump asked on Twitter.      The president also indicated he did not expect much progress on the issue. ""I will absolutely bring that up,"" Trump told reporters. ""I don’t think you’ll hav ### Media: Euronews ### And Trump's recent moves to disrupt America's traditional alliances, both with trade disputes and rhetorical broadsides, enhances Russia's position as Putin seeks to expand Moscow's influence around the world. ### Trump was set to land in Helsinki Sunday night with what he said were low expectations and an unusually loose agenda for the kind of high-stakes international meeting that typically is tightly scripted with predetermined outcomes. ### But Trump has an uncommon faith in his abilities to wing it on the global stage. In a trio of tweets sent Sunday from aboard Air Force One, he complained that the news media would not give him due credit for the summit. ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" Trump tweeted. ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people."" ### When he departed Washington last week, Trump said meeting with Putin may be ""the easiest"" part of his trip. And as in last month's Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, he is banking on his personality to forge a lasting bond with Putin that could improve U.S.-Russia relations and solve some of the world's intractable problems. ### ""He's been very nice to me the times I've met him,"" Trump told reporters last week in Brussels, previewing his Putin tête-à-tête. ""I've been nice to him. He's a competitor ... He's not my enemy. And hopefully, someday, maybe he'll be a friend. It could happen."" ### In an indication of his friendly posture, Trump said he ""hadn't thought"" of asking Putin to extradite the 12 Russian agents indicted by the U.S. Justice Department when prompted in an interview with CBS News anchor Jeff Glor. ### Trump went on to blame his predecessor for Russia's election interference, telling Glor, ""They were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration,"" and adding that the Democratic National Committee ""should be ashamed of themselves for allowing themselves to be hacked."" ### For the Kremlin, blaming Obama and the Washington establishment for the world's ills has been one way to continue winning over Trump. ### Ever since Trump's surprise election victory, Putin has been echoing Trump's claim that investigations into Russian election interference are sinister efforts to delegitimize and sabotage his presidency by Washington's Democratic establishment and ""deep state,"" a reference to the intelligence and national-security apparatus. Both Trump and Putin have said the investigations are undermining U.S.-Russia relations and preventing progress on Syria and other problems. ### ""We are well aware of the extent to which the American establishment is being held hostage to stereotypes and is under the heaviest domestic anti-Russian pressure,"" Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week, according to Tass, a Russian state-controlled news agency. ### In Washington, Democratic leaders called on Trump to cancel the summit over last Friday's indictments. While there is precedent - Obama nixed a Moscow meeting with Putin in 2013 in part because Russia granted asylum to Edward Snowden, who stands accused of illegally leaking U.S. intelligence secrets - Trump decided to keep the meeting. ### Trump has pledged to ask Putin whether Russia interfered in the election, though he said he assumes he will again deny it. ### U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russia is likely to try to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections, and both Democrats and Republicans have implored Trump to sternly warn him against doing so. ### ""All patriotic Americans should understand that Putin is not America's friend, and he is not the president's buddy,"" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said in a statement. ### Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., who recently returned from a visit to Moscow, warned that ""the Russians are very prepared to argue on so many issues that they're not in the wrong."" ### On Monday, Putin is likely to try to win concessions by playing to Trump's eagerness to one-up Obama and reject establishment thinking. ### ""Trump is the ideal partner for a detente without concessions,"" Alexander Baunov, a foreign-policy specialist at the independent Carnegie Moscow Center think tank, recently wrote. ""He's an enemy of the same America that is Russia's adversary."" ### One Russian objective, for instance, has been to win a more accommodating approach from Trump on Russia's intervention in Ukraine, which included the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Putin claims that the Obama Administration fomented the pro-Western revolution in Kiev that year in a bid to weaken Russian influence, and that Russia needed to take over Crimea to protect Russian speakers on the Black Sea peninsula. ### A top Putin ally in Russian parliament, Andrei Klimov, described Trump as a pragmatist with whom Moscow can work productively, in contrast to the ""academic idealist"" Obama who focused on ""irrational matters"" like promoting liberalism and democracy in places like Ukraine. ### ""Trump is a different story,"" Klimov said. ""Ukraine was a project of Mr. Obama. The project didn't pan out."" ### Trump has kept his options open regarding Crimea. Asked last week whether he intends to recognize Crimea as part of Russia when he meets with Putin, Trump blamed the situation on his predecessor. ### ""That was on Barack Obama's watch,"" he told reporters. ""That was not on Trump's watch. Would I have allowed it to happen? No."" Trump added, ""What will happen with Crimea from this point on? That I can't tell you."" ### European leaders, still shellshocked from Trump's ambush over defense spending at last week's NATO meeting, said they fear Trump will legitimize Russia's claim on Crimea. That would mean ending sanctions against Russia, blowing up the security response and giving a green light to the redrawing of international borders by force. ### ""If (European leaders) feel that Trump has dissed them in Brussels and yet embraces Putin and is uncritical of Putin on Monday in Helsinki, that's very bad optics,"" said R. Nicholas Burns, a former ambassador to NATO and senior State Department official in the George W. Bush administration. ### At a dinner of NATO leaders last week in Brussels, Trump told fellow presidents and prime ministers that he would talk with Putin about Russia's involvement in Syria and Ukraine, but went into little detail, according to one official with knowledge of the conversation. Leaders who had dealt with Putin previously recounted their own experiences, while careful not to make it sound as though they were instructing Trump on how to behave, the official said. ### Among Trump's statements that clashed the most with the way America's main European allies see the world were those on immigration. Standing alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May at her Chequers retreat last week, Trump used similar language to the white nationalist movement to denounce immigration as permanently altering cultures throughout Europe. ### ""I think they better watch themselves because you are changing culture,"" Trump said. ""It's a very sad situation."" ### May disagreed, but Trump would find kinship with Putin. The Russian president has described Europe's immigration policy as ""diluting traditional national values."" And Russian state media, like some conservative news outlets in the United States, have been aggressively highlighting security problems and cultural clashes arising from the migration of refugees to Western Europe from Syria and other war-torn places. ### Syria will be another top agenda item, officials on both sides have said. Putin has met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and with a top Iranian official in recent days, stoking speculation Putin and Trump could reach an agreement of some kind over the role that Iran, an ally of Russia, plays in Syria's civil war. ### ""Right now, there's no trust in the relationship, and because of that, problem-solving is practically impossible,"" U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""So this is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama, and quite frankly some of the danger, out of the relationship right now."" ### Monday's summit is scheduled to start at 6 a.m. Washington time with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö welcoming Putin and Trump at Helsinki's Presidential Palace, a neoclassical residence facing the Nordic capital's heavily-touristed Baltic Sea waterfront. Trump and Putin will first meet one-on-one and then be joined by their top advisers for a working lunch. They will conclude their visit with a joint news conference - the first such joint news event between an American and Russian president since 2010. ### Russian officials say it was Trump who insisted holding a one-on-one meeting with Putin to start Monday's talks. But some of them haven't hid their anticipation that such a format will produce desired results. ### ""When he's not under pressure from his own administration, his own ministers, his own lawmakers, I believe Trump is able to talk to Russia far more constructively than we can all imagine,"" lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Russia's upper house of parliament, said in a radio interview. ### Within the U.S. foreign policy establishment, there is considerable concern that Trump is meeting with Putin without the presence of advisers or note-takers. Some Russia experts fear Trump is a relative novice and will be taken advantage of by Putin, a former KGB agent. ### ""Putin is now meeting his fourth U.S. president,"" said Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia. ""He has been working on foreign affairs at the highest levels for two decades and at lower levels his whole life. He knows all the possible agenda items much better than Trump does. So why give the Russian side such an advantage?"" ### --- ### The Washington Post's Seung Min Kim in Helsinki and Michael Birnbaum in Brussels contributed to this report."

He will arrive in Helsinki after presiding over the final game of the World Cup soccer tournament in Moscow on Sunday, and will meet a US president who has spent the last week berating his NATO allies and undercutting his host in Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May. ### Get Today's Headlines in your inbox: ### The day's top stories delivered every morning. ### Sign Up ### Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here ### Even the indictment announced Friday in Washington against 12 Russian military intelligence officers, which prompted some Democrats to demand the cancellation of the Helsinki meeting, could help Putin by playing into a conspiracy theory long embraced by both the Kremlin and the White House that the “deep state” is determined to sabotage Trump’s outreach to Russia. ### Related Links ### Read: Russian bots, trolls test waters ahead of US midterms ### Right before the indictments were announced, in fact, Trump referred to the Russia investigation as a “rigged witch hunt” that “really hurts our relationship with Russia.” ### Anything that stokes divisions inside the United States, or between America and its allies, is viewed by Moscow as a victory. ### Deploying hackers, disinformation campaigns, and support for far-right populist forces in Europe, Putin has long sought to fracture the West and upend the established geopolitical order. But Trump, who routinely attacks European leaders and has started a trade war with some of the United States’ closest allies, is now effectively doing the job for him. ### Advertisement ### Trump’s persistent tirades on the expense of NATO and his fury at the trade practices of the European Union, which he recently described as “possibly as bad as China, just smaller,” have startled even Russian pundits who have for years watched as Putin, like Soviet-era leaders before him, tried in vain to undermine the trans-Atlantic alliance. ### “We are witnessing something surprising, something that even the Soviet Union was not able to accomplish: Divide the US and Western Europe. It didn’t work then, but it seems to be working with Mr. Trump now,” Tatyana Parkhalina, president of the Russian Association for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation, said on a recent talk show on state-run television. ### The summit offers Putin a chance to restore what he and Trump see as the natural order of world affairs, one in which traditional diplomatic alliances are not a given, smaller countries don’t really matter and big powers act in their own self interest, above all else. That order includes Russia playing a central role, instead of being treated like a pariah or a second-rate has-been. ### Whatever the outcome of their talks, the Russian president, thanks to the Kremlin’s firm grip on all Russia’s national television channels, will be able to present his meeting with Trump as proof that his country has come in from the cold and that, as Trump suggested last month, Russia should be readmitted to the Group of 7 club of industrialized democracies. ### Trump cannot unilaterally invite Putin back into the club. Russia was ejected from it after the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. ### Advertisement ### But by meeting with the Russian leader in Helsinki, Trump sends a message that, as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said after meeting Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1984, “we can do business together.” ### Putin is a firm believer that real leaders do not dither. They make deals, unencumbered by caviling aides and persnickety diplomats, as he and Trump will be when they meet in Helsinki. Only translators will be present. ### Yet, officials have made clear that they do not expect a grand bargain to come out of Helsinki.

Trump predicted that the two countries will have an “extraordinary relationship,” but refused to discuss interference by Russia in the previous election: ### JUST IN: President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet and make statements at the presidential palace in Helsinki, Finland, ahead of their one-on-one meeting ### — CNN (@CNN) July 16, 2018 ### President Donald Trump says at the start of his summit with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki that he thinks “the world wants to see us get along.” ### Trump says the two countries have “great opportunities,” saying they have not been getting along for the past few years. He says he thinks they can have an “extraordinary relationship.” ### He says their discussions will involve trade, the military, missiles, nuclear weapons and China, including their “mutual friend” China’s Xi Jingping. He did not mention Russia’s meddling in the U.S. election. ### The two leaders were seated together in a room adorned by American and Russian flags at the Finnish Presidential Palace, separated by a small table. ### Putin offered a terse opening statement, and didn’t show much reaction to the translation of Trump’s remarks. It’s certainly not the first time Putin has heard the general thrust of these kinds of remarks, having been around to meet Trump’s two predecessors, both of whom had the same idea about resetting the Russia relationship at times. Speaking of which , Trump had earlier blamed “stupidity” on the part of previous American administrations for the current state of the US-Russian relationship: ### President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met here Monday for their first formal one-on-one summit, firmly shaking hands hours after Trump began the day by blaming his own country, rather than Russia, for the hostilities between their two nations. … ### Although most U.S. officials argue that Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, use of a nerve agent on British soil and aggression in Ukraine and Syria have worsened relations, Trump instead faulted “U.S. foolishness and stupidity” in tweets Monday morning, as well as the expansive Justice Department investigation into Russia’s election intrusion. ### “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” Trump tweeted Monday morning as he prepared for his meeting with Putin. ### It’s important to keep communications open with Moscow, but it’s also important to remain clear-eyed about the nature of the Putin regime. Unfortunately, it appears that we’re about to repeat history for the third administration in a row. This is the very same attitude that the Obama administration had with Russia. Hillary Clinton’s “reset button” was a crude insult to George W. Bush, who had gotten burned by Putin in the invasion of Georgia after spending several years convinced that Putin was a peacemaker. Barack Obama wanted a deal to reduce nuclear weapons too, and wanted it so badly that he advised Putin stooge Dmitry Medvedev in 2012 to tell Putin that Obama would have “more flexibility” after the election to offer concessions for such an extraordinary deal. ### Rather than get the deal, Russia invaded Ukraine, seized Crimea, and launched a massive intelligence operation to disrupt our elections. Putin has conducted brazen and dangerous assassinations abroad for years, and apparently had that option in mind here for some defectors until we expelled dozens of their operatives this year after the Skripal poisoning. And even after those invasions and the series of unusual deaths among Putin critics, the Obama administration remained passive about the Russian interference operation in hopes of getting a grand nuclear-weapons deal to reset relations once again. One would think we would have learned something from that set of outcomes. ### Instead, here we are … again. The only consistent foolishness and stupidity over the years has been the absolute belief by three presidents in a row that the problem with Putin has been America. Putin, however, is a dedicated Russian imperialist who sees the US not as a competitor but as an opponent, one that he can at times manipulate for his own ends. Putin is not interested in an extraordinary relationship; he’s interested in taking back the Russian empire, very possibly including points farther west than Ukraine. ### That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t meet with Putin and keep the lines of communication open, but we should do so realistically. We met with the Soviet premiers during the Cold War and did so to our benefit in most cases. However, we didn’t meet with the Soviets to plan on being allies by doing so. After almost two decades of Putin’s rule, one would hope that we would have figured out the difference by now."

""I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,"" he said. ### Trump and Putin will meet on Monday in Helsinki for their first stand-alone meeting since Trump took office in January 2017. Trump arrived in Helsinki on Sunday evening after spending the day playing golf at his private club in Scotland. ### The Helsinki summit, which comes at one of the most crucial junctures for the West since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, has alarmed some NATO allies who fear Putin might seek a grand deal that would undermine the U.S.-led transatlantic alliance. ### During last week's NATO summit in Brussels, Trump repeatedly criticized other member countries for failing to spend more on defense, and openly questioned the alliance's purpose. ### In recent months, he has also been highly critical of the EU in trade terms, arguing that its policies make it difficult for U.S. exporters. ### After Trump labeled the EU a ""foe,"" Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, responded on Twitter, using one of Trump's favorite stock phrases. ### ""America and the EU are best friends,"" Tusk wrote. ""Whoever says we are foes is spreading fake news."" ### Trump and his aides have been working through the weekend to soften expectations for tangible results from the Russia meeting. ### ""I go in with low expectations,"" Trump told CBS. ### John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, said in an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" that the United States would not be looking for ""deliverables"" and that the meeting would be ""unstructured,"" beginning with a one-on-one session between the two leaders. ### The U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman, told NBC'S ""Meet the Press"" that the meeting was ""an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama, and quite frankly some of the danger, out of the relationship right now."" ### A probe over allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election has clouded Trump's presidency. Trump has denied any collusion with the Russians by his campaign and Russia denies it meddled. ### BRIGHTER SPOTLIGHT ### For Trump, the formal meeting with Putin is an opportunity to develop a closer working relationship with the Russian president. ### They have met twice before on the sidelines of international summits. Last November, in Vietnam, they agreed to maintain open military channels of communications between their forces in Syria. ### Trump has baffled his own advisers at times with his unabashed desire for strong ties with Putin, White House sources have said. Most U.S. officials see Putin as an unsavory character on the world stage. ### U.S. officials have said they hope to make progress during the talks persuading Russia to use its influence to get Iranian forces out of Syria, as part of a wider campaign to rein in Iran's influence in the Middle East. ### They also expect Trump to bring up Russia's incursion into Ukraine and the allegations of Russian meddling in the election. Other issues include the potential for nuclear arms talks and North Korea's nuclear challenge, given that U.S. officials have said Russia had worked in the past to help Pyongyang circumvent international sanctions. ### Huntsman on Sunday said that it was ""highly unlikely"" the United States would recognize Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, but would not rule it out. ### German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has warned Trump against making any unilateral deals with Russia that come with a cost for the United States' Western allies. ### ALONE IN THE ROOM ### The meeting comes just days after 12 Russian intelligence officers were charged by a U.S. federal grand jury for hacking the Democrats ahead of the 2016 election, the most detailed U.S. accusation yet that Moscow meddled in the election to help Trump. ### When asked by CBS if he would ask Putin to extradite the Russians to the United States, Trump said he might. Russia's constitution forbids the extradition of its own citizens. ### ""I hadn't thought of that,"" Trump said. ""But certainly, I'll be asking about it."" ### The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, said he was worried about Trump being alone in the room with Putin, without his national-security aides. ### ""We know that Trump doesn't do a lot of prep work for these meetings. He kind of goes in and wings it,"" Warner said on NBC's ""Meet the Press. ""I really would feel much better if there were other Americans in the room."" ### The president has repeatedly said the investigation into Russian election meddling is a ""rigged witch hunt"" that makes it hard for him to do substantive deals with Moscow. ### (Reporting by Jeff Mason and Steve Holland in Helsinki.; Additional reporting by Alistair Smout in Turnberry, Scotland, Polina Ivanova in Moscow, and Lesley Wroughton and Daphne Psaledakis in Washington.; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge, William James, and James Oliphant; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Rosalba O'Brien)"

Trump responded by dismissing CNN as “fake news” and turning instead to a reporter from Fox News, which he declared “a real network.” ### — Trump’s “fake news” attack was “music to the ears of dictators and authoritarian leaders,” the Committee to Protect Journalists’ Rob Mahoney told the New York Times. And Trump on Sunday declared much of the U.S. news media the “enemy of the people” as he headed to Helsinki for today’s meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin. ### Story Continued Below ### — ABC’s Jonathan Karl asked Bolton on Sunday’s “This Week” if Trump “branding real news organizations, real news stories, as not real, contributes to this effort that we see from the Russians and from other authoritarians to undermine a free press.” Bolton, who joined the White House from Fox News in March, said the question was “silly.” ### — Both Trump and Putin will appear today on the ""real network,"" as the president has dubbed it. Putin will give his first post-meeting sit-down to Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, who has been known to conduct tough interviews and promises ""no subject off limits.""

Sullivan, which sets him apart from the late Justice Scalia, who famously disagreed with the unanimous decision in that 1964 civil rights era case.” ### — Kavanaugh “has also taken a number of positions that may put him at odds with journalists,” the report finds. “In an area of increasing relevance to the news media and free press issues, Judge Kavanaugh took a permissive approach to government authority in the national security context.

(AP Photo/Peter Morrison) ### GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — President Donald Trump is setting expectations low for his high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, assuring that ""nothing bad ... and maybe some good will come out"" of Monday's meeting in Finland. His national security adviser said they aren't looking for ""concrete deliverables."" ### Trump also tells CBS News in an interview conducted Saturday that he ""hadn't thought"" about asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in Washington on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ### But after being given the idea by his interviewer, Trump said ""certainly I'll be asking about it."" ### He blamed the Democratic National Committee for ""allowing themselves to be hacked"" by Russians trying to help elect him. ### The U.S. has no extradition treaty with Moscow and can't compel Russia to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens to foreign countries. ### Asked whether Trump would ask Putin to turn over the 12 military intelligence officials, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton called the idea ""pretty silly"" and said doing so would put the president in a ""weak position."" ### He said Trump goes into the summit with a stronger hand because of the indictments. ### ""I think the president can put this on the table and say, 'This is a serious matter that we need to talk about,'"" Bolton said. He said asking for the indicted Russians to be turned over would have the opposite effect. ### ""For the president to demand something that isn't going to happen puts the president in a weak position, and I think the president has made it very clear he intends to approach this discussion from a position of strength."" ### In the CBS News interview, Trump said he's entering the Helsinki summit with ""low expectations. I'm not going with high expectations."" He declined to discuss his goals, but said such sessions are beneficial. He cited his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June as a ""good thing,"" along with meetings he's had with Chinese President Xi Jinping. ### ""Nothing bad is going to come out of it (Helsinki), and maybe some good will come out,"" Trump said. ### He described the European Union, a bloc of nation's that includes many of America's closest allies, as a ""foe."" ### ""I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,"" Trump said, adding that ""you wouldn't think of the European Union but they're a foe."" ### He said Russia is a foe ""in certain respects"" and that China is a foe ""economically ... but that doesn't mean they are bad. It doesn't mean anything. It means that they are competitive."" Trump has been reluctant to criticize Putin over the years and has described him as a competitor in recent days. ### Trump said he respects Europe's leaders but adds that they've taken advantage of the U.S. on trade and defense spending. ### The president sat for the interview Saturday in Scotland and CBS News released excerpts hours before Trump flew to Helsinki on Sunday. ### Trump and Putin have held talks twice before. Their first meeting came last July while both participated in an international summit and continued for more than two hours, well over the scheduled 30 minutes. The leaders also met last fall during a separate summit in Vietnam. ### But Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, said Monday's meeting ""is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation and I hope it's a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests."" ### Congressional Democrats and at least one Republican have called on Trump to pull out of Monday's meeting unless he is willing to make Russian election-meddling the top issue. Huntsman said the summit must go on because Russian engagement is needed to solve some international issues. ### ""The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off-the-charts high so it's a good thing these presidents are getting together,"" he said. ### Trump has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling, along with Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation and other topics. Bolton described the meeting as ""unstructured"" and said: ""We're not looking for concrete deliverables here."" ### Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., rejected Bolton's assertion that the indictments put Trump in a stronger position going in to the meeting. ### ""He has already said that he has asked Putin about meddling, Putin told him he didn't do it, and he believed him,"" Murphy said. ""And so it just belies common sense that the president of the United States, this president, is going to sit down across from Putin and press him hard on the issue of Russian meddling."" ### Putin has denied meddling in the election. ### Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said it's inevitable that Russia will interfere in U.S. elections and that it's pointless for Trump to confront Putin about it. ### Paul said both countries spy on each other but adds that Russian interference in the 2016 election isn't ""morally equivalent"" to U.S. interference in Russian elections, but ""I think in their mind it is."" ### Huntsman was interviewed on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Paul appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" and Bolton and Murphy spoke on ABC's ""This Week."" ### ___"

Liberals and their puppets in media accuse him of “collusion.” Quite ridiculous given that collusion isn’t a crime and to date the special counsel has found no evidence of either a crime or collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians in the 2016 election — despite 18 months of relentless digging. ### In case liberals haven’t noticed, American presidents and their administrations often speak and meet with foreign leaders, including adversaries. ### It’s called foreign policy. ### Trump was smart not to cancel his summit with Putin today despite the tweets from U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and hypocritical demands from congressional Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. ### Yes, the Justice Department last week announced 12 Russian military intelligence officers hacked into the DNC servers and Republican and Democrat campaigns during the 2016 election. If that’s true, it requires a strong response. We don’t want foreign adversaries committing cybercrimes against the U.S. But it’s no reason to cancel an important summit with a key superpower. ### After all, a 2016 congressional investigation found the Obama administration’s State Department meddled in Israel’s 2015 parliamentary election in an effort to block its Iran deal chief nemesis, Benjamin Netanyahu, from getting re-elected. ### And the Los Angeles Times reported in 2016, “The U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential elections in other countries — it’s done so as many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database amassed by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University.” ### Why don’t left-wing talking heads mention that? ### Here are the facts. President Trump has been tougher on Russia than his predecessors. The Trump administration is arming Ukraine in its war with Russian-backed separatists. Trump has repeatedly imposed punitive sanctions. He’s expelled 60 Russian diplomats and mothballed the Russian consulate in Seattle. Trump is also trying to get NATO ally Germany to cancel its natural gas pipeline deal with Russia and get its energy from us instead —which would be a massive financial blow to the Kremlin. ### But liberals never let facts get in the way of pushing conspiracy theories of “Russian collusion” with Trump. #SAD ### Adriana Cohen is a nationally syndicated columnist and Herald Radio host.

7350,breitbart.com,2018-07-15T07:10:56-04:00,"AFP ### 14 Jul 2018 ### London (AFP) – Here are five highlights from US President Donald Trump’s trip to Europe, as he prepares to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday: ### – Sticking it to the Germans – ### Trump started his trip Wednesday by blasting Germany for falling well short of its NATO spending commitments, while preparing to increase its reliance on Russian gas imports. ### He tore into Berlin for paying billions of dollars to Russia while the United States spends billions on defending Germany. ### “Germany is a captive of Russia because it is getting so much of its energy from Russia,” he said, taking aim at the proposed Nord Stream II gas pipeline. ### After meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump changed his tune and claimed he had very good relations with her. ### But on Thursday he was tweeting that Germany’s stance was “Not acceptable!” ### And on Friday, he described the pipeline as a “horrible mistake” that would give Russia power over Germany. ### – NATO spending spat – ### At the NATO summit in Brussels, Trump slammed allies for failing to meet their defence spending commitments, demanding that they meet their two percent of GDP pledge “immediately” instead of by 2024 as previously agreed. ### Apart from the United States, only three of the 29 NATO countries hit the two-percent target in 2017: Britain, Greece and Estonia. ### He then stunned allies by telling them to eventually double the figure to four percent. ### Trump claimed NATO leaders agreed to a big boost in defence spending. ### But French President Emmanuel Macron disputed Trump’s claims, saying that the joint statement the leaders had signed went no further than what had previously been agreed — reaching two percent by 2024 — apart from setting out how some countries plan to get there. ### “We have left NATO with more money, more unity, more spirit than NATO probably has ever had,” he claimed Friday. ### – Brexit bust-up – ### Arriving in Britain on Thursday for his first visit as president, Trump kicked things off with a tabloid newspaper interview in which he said British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit proposals would probably kill off the chances of a trade deal with the United States. ### Trump told The Sun that May had ignored his suggestions on how to handle the departure negotiations with the European Union. ### But the president said Friday suggested that a trade deal was possible. ### “Whatever you do is OK with us, just make sure we can trade together: that’s all that matters. The United States looks forward to finalising a great bilateral trade agreement,” he said. ### – Tackling Theresa May – ### In Trump’s Sun interview, he said Boris Johnson, who quit as Britain’s foreign minister over May’s Brexit proposals, would make a “great prime minister”. ### Many in Britain interpreted that as undermining May before they had even met, combined with his Brexit intervention. ### But he lavished praise on her after their meeting at the premier’s Chequers country residence. ### “She’s a tough negotiator… She’s a very, very smart and determined person… she left a lot of people in her wake,” he said. ### “I would much rather have her as my friend than my enemy.” ### – Face-off with Putin – ### Trump ends his visit by meeting Putin in the Finnish capital. Before leaving Washington, he said tackling Putin might surprisingly be the easiest part of the trip. ### He said Friday he had been “extremely tough on Russia… far tougher on Russia than anybody”. ### Referring to an ongoing investigation into ties between his election campaign and Russia, he decried a “rigged witch-hunt” that was hurting the United States and its relationship with Moscow. ### Trump said he was “not going in with high expectations” but wanted to develop a personal relationship with Putin, which he hoped would yield some “very surprising things”. ### ."

What does the Russian president have on him? ### Paul Brandus, Opinion contributor Published 12:15 a.m. MT July 15, 2018 | Updated 4:29 a.m. MT July 15, 2018 ### New Mueller indictments underscore that Vladimir Putin attacks, undermines and opposes America anytime he can. Russia is a hostile adversary. Why won't Trump admit it? ### Russian President Vladimir Putin ### CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 27 COMMENTEMAILMORE ### When I went to work in the American Embassy in Moscow in 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed, I learned a valuable word: maskirovka . It means “disguise,” and the first syllable — mask — is all you need to know. A mask conceals. It deceives. Truth and knowledge come only by lifting it and peering behind it. Until then, the advantage goes to the wearer. ### And so it is with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president who has so enchanted President Donald Trump, for reasons that we cannot yet confirm. From Canada to Korea, Trump, in his first year-and-a-half in office, has hurled thunderbolts of criticism at virtually every major American ally. Stirring his ire? They don't spend enough on defense, or they have a trade surplus with us. Sometimes both. Yet when it comes to Russia and Putin — who is anything but an ally — it’s kid gloves. Why? Because Putin’s maskirovka has worked on a grand scale. Trump can’t see (or admit) what’s going on, and there’s nothing to suggest this dynamic will ever change. ### Here’s what Trump and his often cult-like, believe-anything-he-says followers fail to acknowledge: U.S. intelligence agencies and the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee all say Russia hacked the 2016 election and tried to tip it in Trump’s direction. The tsunami of evidence now includes Friday's indictments of a dozen elite Russian military hackers who, the Justice Department says, stole information from Democratic organizations and 500,000 voters. That's a flat-out attack on our country and our way of life that Trump does not even acknowledge. ### Trump is appeasing a hostile adversary ### Russia can, some U.S. analysts say , easily seize three Baltic nations — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — that used to be in the Soviet Union but are now in NATO. Russia backs Syria’s Bashar Assad , North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and the mullahs in Tehran. Putin taunts our military by having his warplanes buzz U.S. navy ships and fly perilously close to our own aircraft. Putin has engaged in a crash program to rebuild his nuclear triad (Trump didn’t know what that was in 2016). And Putin’s state-controlled media loves to remind us that Russia is capable of reducing the U.S. to ashes. ### And yet none of this bothers Trump, who describes Putin as a mere “competitor"" who is “not my enemy.” He doesn’t call the Russian dictator a friend either, but that’s only because “I don't know him very well.” ### A “competitor?” Putin attacks us, undermines our election, actively opposes us everywhere he can — and Trump willingly, perhaps naively, plays along. And his supporters call Barack Obama the appeaser? At least Obama took action against the Russians before and after the election, hitting Moscow with sanctions , closing Russian facilities here and kicking out dozens of “diplomats.” Trump can’t even admit that election interference occurred. He has said he believes Putin's denials — a slap in the face to the dedicated men and women of America’s intelligence agencies. ### As Trump meets Putin, we'll spotlight and resist Russian aggression: Warner & Rubio ### Here’s the part where Trump defenders point out that the president signed a law calling for new sanctions against Moscow, too. What they don’t seem to know — or can’t admit — is that Trump fought the bill and signed it only because Congress passed it with veto-proof majorities. Trump also sought to reopen the facilities that Obama ordered closed. ### Let’s face it: When it comes to Russia, the true appeaser here, the apologist, the defender of the Kremlin, is the current president. ### Speaking of maskirovka, it’s important to peel Putin’s mask away ourselves and remember what we’re dealing with here. Putin looks strong on the global stage, but it’s a distraction from huge problems he faces at home. Russia is very weak internally.  Thanks to environmental degradation, staggering alcoholism and other deepening problems, the average Russian lives six years less than the average American. The average Russian male lives to be just 66 , a full decade less than American men. (To be fair, it’s worth noting that our own life expectancy has now fallen for two years in a row.) ### Russia not doing well under Putin ### Other than oil and natural gas, Russia has nothing the world wants. It is a nation of 146 million people (a number some demographers say is shrinking), and yet California, Texas and New York have bigger economies . ### Corruption, lack of transparency and organized crime — all of which blend into the government itself — send foreign investors scurrying. In the meantime, beyond pseudo-glittery Moscow and St. Petersburg — the only places in Russia familiar to most foreigners — there has been widespread labor unrest in both the private and public sectors, as Russians go long stretches without being paid. Intriguingly, the Washington Post notes , this extends to first responders who would normally be expected to control public protests. ### Anyone who has studied Russian history knows that social explosions have often started in the hinterlands. During the Soviet era, such rebellions were put down ruthlessly by the army. Putin has called the collapse of the USSR a catastrophe. What would he do if his own regime were under threat? ### Putin is punching well above his weight. Why is Trump so enthralled with this man? What does Moscow have on him? That secret remains behind Putin’s mask; we must continue to pry it away. ### Paul Brandus, founder and White House bureau chief of West Wing Reports, is the author of "" Under This Roof: The White House and the Presidency "" and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

There was no figure immediately available from organisers. ### ""Whiny demented man-baby meets evil master spy. What could go wrong?"" read another banner made by a Finnish woman. ### Kira Vorlick, an American woman aged 30 who works in Finland's booming mobile game industry, said she left California a year ago ""to get away from"" Trump. ### ""After the indictment of the Russian agents, he should not have met with Putin,"" she added, referring to the indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence operatives in a long-running probe into whether Russia hacked Trump's Democratic opponents in the 2016 elections. ### Another sign read ""Free children, jail Trump,"" referring to the US administration's much-vilified policy of separating undocumented child immigrants from their parents. ### ""The world's going to shit and we need to make our voices heard when we can,"" Finnish man Hannu Jaakkola, a 37-year-old events organiser, said. ### The crowd repeated a refrain heard at many anti-Trump protests including one that drew tens of thousands to London as the president visited Britain last week: ""No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!"" ### But in Helsinki, which lies close to the Russian border, there was plenty of heat on Putin too. ### Another Finnish man, who works as an elderly-care nurse, held a sign in both English and Russian saying ""Putin prison for lifetime"". ### He declined to give his name for fear of being targeted by some of Helsinki's many Russian residents. ### ""Putin's such a troublemaker and he is our neighbour, unfortunately. He's scary for us and for the Baltic states,"" he said. ### ""He's been spreading fear in Britain too, in Salisbury. He's a madman,"" he added, after the British government accused Moscow of unleashing a deadly nerve agent in the English city. Russia denies the charge. ### One banner at the Helsinki protest demanded the release of Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who has been on hunger strike in a Russian prison for two months. ### Banners reading ""Respect Ukraine"" and ""Make human rights great again"" were also on show, along with Palestinian flags. ### Finland's top-selling newspaper Helsingin Sanomat got in on the act, paying for 300 billboards on the route from Helsinki's airport to the downtown summit venue to say to both leaders: ""Mr President, welcome to the land of free press."" ### Several smaller protests are planned for Monday when Putin and Trump are due to hold their talks in Helsinki's presidential palace."

In the 48 hours since the announcement that 12 Russian military intelligence agents have been indicted on charges of breaking into Democrats' computer networks in 2016 seeking to tip the election in Trump's favor, the president quieted his doubts about Moscow's culpability. ### But he shows no sign that he cares a lot, or even blames Russia as much as he blames his predecessor ("" Why didn’t Obama do something about it ?"") or the victims (“The DNC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing themselves to be hacked."") ### Sign up for The 1600 ### National Security Adviser John Bolton said on ABC's ""This Week"" that it's "" hard to believe "" Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't know about the interference. Bolton contended that when Trump meets with Putin at their summit in Helsinki on Monday, the indictments ""strengthens his hand"" in pressing the issue. But Trump has signaled that if Putin lies to him again, he is ready to shrug it off. ### ""I will absolutely bring that up. I don't think you'll have any, 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.' There won't be a Perry Mason here , I don't think,"" Trump said Friday. And then? ""And hopefully, we'll have a very good relationship with Russia,"" he said Friday. ### Administration officials have warned Trump that the threat from Russian cyberattacks continues, but he refuses to take it seriously because he sees any suggestion that Moscow's thumb on the scale helped him as an attack on the legitimacy of his 2016 victory,  Axios reports . ### He will save his anger for special counsel Robert Mueller's ""witch hunt"" investigation — which is exposing the depth and breadth of Russia's interference — and for his "" NO COLLUSION! "" tweets. ### Get The 1600 newsletter ### For more, see Newsday's story by Scott Eidler and David M. Schwartz . ### Can't satisfy you people ### Trump said in an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that he's heading into Monday’s meeting with Putin with “ very low expectations .” ### “I think that getting along with Russia is a good thing, but it’s possible we won’t,” Trump said. ### Then, on Twitter, he mocked critics who call him too soft on Putin. ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia . . . over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" ### Winding up the tweet threat by hitting his favorite targets, Trump said: ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems ... ... know how to do is resist and obstruct!"" ### Janison: Shoes still to drop? ### Following the indictments of the 12 Russians, Trump's legal and press office mouthpieces pushed the line that the absence of Americans among the latest charged puts his campaign in the clear on the ""collusion"" question. That's spinful thinking. ### As Newsday's Dan Janison writes , the indictment included the intriguing statement that ""the conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, wrote to a person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump."" More of the story remains to be told as the probe continues, and pressure did increase on Trump to go through the motions of raising the issue with Putin. ### That Helsink-ing feeling ### Election interference aside, there is concern in Washington and throughout the West over whether Trump will hold firm on other critical issues, including Putin’s intervention in Syria and Ukraine, The Washington Post reported . ### Trump's behavior at the NATO summit and his trip to Britain only underscored anxieties. Trump echoed Putin’s ideological worldview and his political posture — from decrying immigration patterns that the U.S. president said were destroying European culture to assaulting the media and blaming the U.S. “deep state"" for the poor condition of U.S.-Russian relations. ### Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, predicted that Putin will “ take advantage ” of Trump and voiced alarm at the plan for them to meet with no aides and only translators present. ### “Vladimir Putin is a trained KGB agent. He may come in with maps of Syria or maps of Ukraine, and frankly I think he’ll take advantage of this president, who we know doesn’t do much prep work before these meetings,” Sen. Mark Warner said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” ### No Europe paeans from Trump ### In a CBS News interview on the eve of meeting Putin, Trump was asked to identify his ""biggest foe globally right now."" The first of his list: ""I think the European Union is a foe , what they do to us in trade. Now, you wouldn't think of the European Union, but they're a foe."" ### He went on to describe Russia as a ""foe in certain respects"" and China as ""a foe economically."" ### Trump's antipathy to the EU puts him on the same side as Putin. In 2013-14, a popular uprising in Ukraine in favor of closer ties with the EU instead of Russia led to a military incursion by Putin and the annexation of Crimea. ### See Eidler and Schwartz's story for Newsday . ### A ploy named sue ### Trump complained last week that British Prime Minister Theresa May wouldn't take his advice on how to steer Brexit — Britain's exit from the EU. He wouldn't say what he recommended other than to say that May found it too ""brutal."" ### May revealed the advice Sunday in an interview with the BBC. ### “He told me I should sue the EU  — not go into negotiations. Sue them."" She added with a laugh: ""Actually, no, we’re going into negotiations with them,” May said. ### Threatening lawsuits has been a standard Trump business tactic. It remains a mystery what grounds he thought Britain could find to sue the EU. ### European Council President Donald Tusk answered with a snarky tweet: “America and the EU are best friends. Whoever says we are foes is spreading fake news ."" ### What else is happening: ### Trump told a British interviewer that  ""I fully intend "" to run in 2020 — ""it seems like everybody wants me to."" But there was one slight equivocation: ‘Well you never know what happens with health and other things."" ### White House canceled Bolton's scheduled appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was to punish the network for "" bad behavior "" by its reporter Jim Acosta during the Trump-May news conference. What did Acosta do ? He tried to ask a question. ### The White House fired a top National Security Council official, Jennifer Arangio, who clashed with other officials there, including policy aide Stephen Meller. ""She has fought to correct misleading information about refugees and migrants provided to the president by Miller"" and other domestic advisers, a former White House official told Politico. ### Trump's respite in Scotland before the flight to Helsinki gave him another opportunity for a common pastime of his presidency — promoting a Trump-branded property — in this case his money-losing golf course in Turnberry, Politico reports . “The weather is beautiful, and this place is incredible!” Trump tweeted Saturday. ### Scottish police said they arrested a man in connection with a Greenpeace protest that breached a no-fly security zone and flew a banner from a paraglider close to Turnberry while Trump was there. ### U.S. and North Korean officials held ""productive"" talks Sunday to discuss the return of U.S. service members' remains missing since the Korean War , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. The North Koreans had canceled a meeting last week. ### By William Goldschlag and Dan Janison william.goldschlag@newsday.com , dan.janison@newsday.com"

Dick Durbin said charges brought last week against Russian agents accused of interfering with the 2016 presidential election is something “we ought to take personally in Illinois” because the state’s voter database was a target. ### While Durbin said he has received assurances from Illinois election officials that the state’s system is now secure, the senator said he was not convinced. ### “I hope they are right, but we know the Russians and others are working night and day to break into all system, so I can’t say with confidence that our election process is going to be intact and secure,” Durbin said during a Sunday news conference outside his Springfield home. “I don’t believe we’ve put enough resources as a nation into investigating what happened two years ago and making sure it never happens again.” ### A spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections said Friday that the agency had not received confirmation from the U.S. Department of Justice, but believes Illinois’ elections board is referenced in last week’s indictment of Russian hackers. ### Illinois elections board 'very likely' named in Mueller indictment of Russian hackers, officials say » ### The hacking was discovered in July 2016, and the FBI issued an alert the following month. The timeline listed in the indictment matches up with what the state publicly acknowledged about a data breach in 2016. Elections officials say they believe the information of about 76,000 voters was compromised. ### The indictment by special counsel Robert Mueller came just ahead of Monday’s scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland. Durbin called on Trump to cancel or delay the meeting “unless it’s clear the president is going to confront Putin at the outset with this clear evidence.” He and other Senate Democrats sent Trump a letter to that effect this weekend. ### “The first thing that the President ought to say to Vladimir Putin is ‘We want you to extradite the accused Russian intelligence officers,’ ” Durbin said. “Of course he will refuse, but if the president doesn’t start with that you wonder, will Putin take him seriously?”"

That is not surprising, as the country’s state media are fully controlled by Putin’s government. (Mikhail Metzel/Tass/Getty Images) ### President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in Helsinki on Monday morning, but before the weekend even started, the Kremlin-controlled state media had already declared an easy victory. ### The fact that this top-level tête-à-tête is set to take place provides confirmation that Putin’s Russia was able to end the country’s isolation without giving an inch. The summit was preceded by the recent visit from eight Republican lawmakers, most of whom celebrated the Fourth of July in Moscow. On Russian state television, both of these events have been portrayed as concessions by the United States . Appearing on state TV, Igor Korotchenko, member of the Defense Ministry’s public advisory council, argued that Russia should look down on Americans the same way the Soviet Union did : “You came to us, because you need something.” In an ongoing confrontation with the Russians, America blinked first. The Kremlin is barreling through, with eyes wide open. ### Russian state media are hard at work, praising Putin’s strategy that is finally paying off. That is not surprising, as the state media in Russia are fully controlled by the government. Positions conveyed by the Kremlin’s bullhorns reflect only what is considered permissible by the state. On Russian state television, criticism of  Putin is unheard of, and mildly dissenting views are allowed mostly so they can be mocked. Government-controlled propaganda, combined with fear of retribution, secure consistently high approval ratings for the seemingly irreplaceable Russian leader. Putin is always portrayed as a masterful chess player whose every move is pure genius. State TV is already providing a preview of Putin’s likely strategy: flatter Trump’s ego and bond over common enemies, blaming past U.S.-Russia tensions on the U.S. “deep state,” the news media and, most of all, President Barack Obama and Trump’s former rival, Hillary Clinton. ### [ The Clinton campaign warned you about Russia. But nobody listened to us. ] ### Trump has relayed low expectations for the summit : “I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much.” But that’s not the case for the Kremlin. The state media reveals that Putin’s Russia expects everything, in exchange for nothing. Based on Trump’s statements, they predict the impending recognition of the Russian occupation of Crimea and “ the creeping removal of sanctions .” They also believe that Trump will withdraw his stated objections  to the Nord-Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany. ### Officially, Russia admits nothing about interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections, but Kremlin-controlled state media is not as reserved in its messages designed for internal consumption. Russian state TV hosts brazenly assert, “Trump is ours ,” and joke that the U.S. lawmakers traveled to Russia “to make deals with our hackers, so they can rig the midterms in favor of Trump’s team.”  They gleefully anticipate that Putin will run circles around “political neophyte” Trump , “educating” him about world events from the Russian perspective. ### A former intelligence operative, Putin is portrayed as a master manipulator , skilled in “studying the mind of the targets, finding their vulnerabilities, and figuring out how to use them.” He will likely use camaraderie and flattery with Trump. Since Fox News is known to echo Trump’s point of view, Russian state TV has taken to airing the network’s clips complaining about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s “witch hunt” investigation. Between Fox News and Trump’s own revealing tweets, Putin undoubtedly knows which buttons to push for a maximum advantage. ### [ This is what foreign spies see when they read Trump’s tweets ] ### The key common “enemies” named by Russian state TV are Democrats, “the deep state” and the U.S. media. Clinton and Obama top the list of foes frequently blamed by Russian politicians and state media for everything that is wrong with the world, including the deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations . Putin will probably use the same talking points to create an illusion of standing alongside Trump against the same opponents. ### The Kremlin is also sure to capitalize on Trump’s vanity. Russian state TV experts speculate that Trump’s ego will be satisfied by striking a deal with Russia , just to show that he accomplished something his predecessors couldn’t. Putin’s propaganda networks are already saying that part of the summit will exclude any aides or advisers, repeatedly predicting that “secret verbal deals” will be made . This type of uncertainty presents a golden propaganda opportunity for the Kremlin, not unlike the approach recently taken by Russian state media with the visiting U.S. lawmakers, who agreed to meet with Russian counterparts behind closed doors. The ensuing conflicting reports  enabled the Kremlin to portray the U.S. visitors as weak, timid and ready to make concessions. ### The Kremlin is not planning to make concessions of its own — a fact that is repeatedly reiterated by  Russian state media. Russian politicians and experts point out that the United States, not Russia, is initiating conciliatory efforts. The United States is portrayed as an adversary that realized the futility of past attempts to isolate or punish Russia. The coverage hints that Trump is expected to offer concessions on multiple fronts to normalize relations, letting bygones be bygones. ### State media provide a preview of Putin’s likely response to any questions about the Kremlin’s interference in U.S. elections. TV hosts, politicians and experts are quick to point out that none of Mueller’s indictments suggest that Russia changed the ultimate outcome. They also counter-accuse the United States of interfering in Russia’s internal affairs. State Duma member Leonid Kalashnikov recently said that every country meddles in others’ elections , to a nervous reaction from both state TV hosts, one of whom noted: “You just admitted our interference.” Fortunately for the Kremlin, Trump tends to downplay the magnitude of any meddling, instead blaming Democrats for pushing the issue. Putin will certainly seize the opportunity to solidify that dismissive mind-set in addressing any questions about the latest set of indictments . ### But to Putin-friendly Russian media, there’s no real need to worry about the indictments or whatever discussion Trump plans to have with Putin about hacking. The Kremlin, state TV says, sees the summit as Trump’s explicit attempt to normalize relations with Russia, wiping the slate clean as to any outstanding issues. ### After all, state media argue, if Crimea or election interference were important enough, the summit wouldn’t even be happening. ### Read more:"

Russia is a hostile adversary. Why won't Trump admit it? ### Russian President Vladimir Putin ### CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 30 COMMENTEMAILMORE ### When I went to work in the American Embassy in Moscow in 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed, I learned a valuable word: maskirovka . It means “disguise,” and the first syllable — mask — is all you need to know. A mask conceals. It deceives. Truth and knowledge come only by lifting it and peering behind it. Until then, the advantage goes to the wearer. ### And so it is with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president who has so enchanted President Donald Trump, for reasons that we cannot yet confirm. From Canada to Korea, Trump, in his first year-and-a-half in office, has hurled thunderbolts of criticism at virtually every major American ally. Stirring his ire? They don't spend enough on defense, or they have a trade surplus with us. Sometimes both. Yet when it comes to Russia and Putin — who is anything but an ally — it’s kid gloves. Why? Because Putin’s maskirovka has worked on a grand scale. Trump can’t see (or admit) what’s going on, and there’s nothing to suggest this dynamic will ever change. ### Here’s what Trump and his often cult-like, believe-anything-he-says followers fail to acknowledge: U.S. intelligence agencies and the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee all say Russia hacked the 2016 election and tried to tip it in Trump’s direction. The tsunami of evidence now includes Friday's indictments of a dozen elite Russian military hackers who, the Justice Department says, stole information from Democratic organizations and 500,000 voters. That's a flat-out attack on our country and our way of life that Trump does not even acknowledge. ### Trump is appeasing a hostile adversary ### Russia can, some U.S. analysts say , easily seize three Baltic nations — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — that used to be in the Soviet Union but are now in NATO. Russia backs Syria’s Bashar Assad , North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and the mullahs in Tehran. Putin taunts our military by having his warplanes buzz U.S. navy ships and fly perilously close to our own aircraft. Putin has engaged in a crash program to rebuild his nuclear triad (Trump didn’t know what that was in 2016). And Putin’s state-controlled media loves to remind us that Russia is capable of reducing the U.S. to ashes. ### And yet none of this bothers Trump, who describes Putin as a mere “competitor"" who is “not my enemy.” He doesn’t call the Russian dictator a friend either, but that’s only because “I don't know him very well.” ### A “competitor?” Putin attacks us, undermines our election, actively opposes us everywhere he can — and Trump willingly, perhaps naively, plays along. And his supporters call Barack Obama the appeaser? At least Obama took action against the Russians before and after the election, hitting Moscow with sanctions , closing Russian facilities here and kicking out dozens of “diplomats.” Trump can’t even admit that election interference occurred. He has said he believes Putin's denials — a slap in the face to the dedicated men and women of America’s intelligence agencies. ### As Trump meets Putin, we'll spotlight and resist Russian aggression: Warner & Rubio ### Here’s the part where Trump defenders point out that the president signed a law calling for new sanctions against Moscow, too. What they don’t seem to know — or can’t admit — is that Trump fought the bill and signed it only because Congress passed it with veto-proof majorities. Trump also sought to reopen the facilities that Obama ordered closed. ### Let’s face it: When it comes to Russia, the true appeaser here, the apologist, the defender of the Kremlin, is the current president. ### Speaking of maskirovka, it’s important to peel Putin’s mask away ourselves and remember what we’re dealing with here. Putin looks strong on the global stage, but it’s a distraction from huge problems he faces at home. Russia is very weak internally.  Thanks to environmental degradation, staggering alcoholism and other deepening problems, the average Russian lives six years less than the average American. The average Russian male lives to be just 66 , a full decade less than American men. (To be fair, it’s worth noting that our own life expectancy has now fallen for two years in a row.) ### Russia not doing well under Putin ### Other than oil and natural gas, Russia has nothing the world wants. It is a nation of 146 million people (a number some demographers say is shrinking), and yet California, Texas and New York have bigger economies . ### Corruption, lack of transparency and organized crime — all of which blend into the government itself — send foreign investors scurrying. In the meantime, beyond pseudo-glittery Moscow and St. Petersburg — the only places in Russia familiar to most foreigners — there has been widespread labor unrest in both the private and public sectors, as Russians go long stretches without being paid. Intriguingly, the Washington Post notes , this extends to first responders who would normally be expected to control public protests. ### Anyone who has studied Russian history knows that social explosions have often started in the hinterlands. During the Soviet era, such rebellions were put down ruthlessly by the army. Putin has called the collapse of the USSR a catastrophe. What would he do if his own regime were under threat? ### Putin is punching well above his weight. Why is Trump so enthralled with this man? What does Moscow have on him? That secret remains behind Putin’s mask; we must continue to pry it away. ### Paul Brandus, founder and White House bureau chief of West Wing Reports, is the author of "" Under This Roof: The White House and the Presidency "" and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

It doesn’t mean anything. It means that they are competitive.” ### Trump has been reluctant to criticize Putin over the years and has described him in recent days not as an enemy but as a competitor. ### On Sunday, Trump flew to Finland, the final stop on a weeklong trip that began last Tuesday. Near Trump’s hotel, police roped off a group of about 60 mostly male pro-Trump demonstrators waving American flags. Big banners said “Welcome Trump” and “God Bless D & M Trump” and a helicopter hovered overhead. ### Chants of “We love Trump, We love Trump” broke out as the president’s motorcade passed, and Trump waved. ### Trump set expectations for the summit low, telling CBS News, “I don’t expect anything. … I go in with very low expectations.” His national security adviser said they weren’t looking for any “concrete deliverables.” ### He also said in the interview taped Saturday that he “hadn’t thought” about asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in Washington on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ### But after being given the idea by his interviewer, Trump said, “Certainly I’ll be asking about it.” ### The U.S. has no extradition treaty with Moscow and can’t compel Russia to hand over citizens. Russia’s constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens to foreign countries. ### Contradicting Trump in an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the idea of asking Putin to turn over the 12 military intelligence officials was “pretty silly” and argued that doing so would put the U.S. president in a “weak position.” ### He also argued that Trump is entering the summit with a stronger hand because of the indictments. ### “I think the president can put this on the table and say, ‘This is a serious matter that we need to talk about,'” said Bolton, adding that asking for the indicted Russians to be turned over would have the opposite effect. ### In the CBS News interview, Trump declined to discuss his goals for the summit — “I’ll let you know after the meeting,” he said — but said he believes such sessions are beneficial. ### He cited his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June as a “good thing,” along with meetings he’s had with Chinese President Xi Jinping. ### “Nothing bad is going to come out of” the Helsinki meeting, he said, “and maybe some good will come out.” ### From aboard Air Force One, Trump complained in tweets that he wasn’t getting enough credit for his meeting with Kim and railed that “Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people” as he headed to sit down with Putin. ### Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some Russian journalists. Trump regularly criticizes American news media outlets and has called out some journalists by name. ### Trump complained: “No matter how well I do at the Summit,” he’ll face “criticism that it wasn’t good enough.” ### “If I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough — that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” he tweeted. ### Trump also praised Putin for holding the World Cup, which finished up Sunday. ### Trump and Putin have held talks several times before. Their first meeting came last July when both participated in an international summit and continued for more than two hours, well over the scheduled 30 minutes. The leaders also met last fall during a separate summit in Vietnam. ### But Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, said Monday’s meeting “is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation, and I hope it’s a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests.” ### Congressional Democrats and at least one Republican have called on Trump to pull out of Monday’s meeting unless he is willing to make Russian election-meddling the top issue. Huntsman said the summit must go on because Russian engagement is needed to solve some international issues. ### “The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off-the-charts high so it’s a good thing these presidents are getting together,” he said during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” ### Trump has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling, along with Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation and other topics. Bolton described the meeting as “unstructured” and said: “We’re not looking for concrete deliverables here.” ### ___ ### Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington and Jamey Keaten in Helsinki contributed to this report. ### JILL COLVIN"

Some 70% of Russians watched the tournament, VTsIOM found. ### US President Donald Trump, right, meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on  July 7, 2017. ### Monday's summit gives Putin a chance to practice a role he has been perfecting for 18 years: Playing the statesman. Like a royal wedding or Trump's meetup in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Helsinki will be an extraordinary photo opportunity for the Kremlin leader, putting him on equal footing with his American counterpart. ### A one-on-one meeting with Trump gives the meticulously prepared Russian President a chance to appear the more assured player, in a sit-down with his famously brash and improvisational American counterpart. ### Putin is always well briefed: His annual marathon press conference is perhaps the Kremlin leader's most telling display of his vast knowledge, having mastered the minutiae of economic data and statistics. ### Read More ### Beyond the fanfare, however, not everything looks rosy for Putin. The Department of Justice's announcement on Friday of the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers for interfering in the 2016 presidential election has led to calls for Trump to cancel the meeting with the Russian President. ### That is unlikely to happen. Trump, who has been in Brussels, Belgium, and the United Kingdom this week, repeated his call for better relations with Russia several times. And Trump has repeatedly criticized the investigation, which implicates members of his own election campaign team, as a ""witch hunt."" ### Putin's meeting with Trump may be the distraction he needs right now. Russians may have World Cup fever, but the monthlong celebrations have not translated to a sense of greater well-being for the country's citizens. ### In a poll taken at the height of the World Cup, VTsIOM found that Russians reported that all indices of social well-being in June were down from the same period last year. Respondents said they felt more pessimistic about a range of factors: their financial well-being, their confidence in the economy, and their support for the political course of the country. ### Compared with the same survey in mid-2014, when the country was swept with nationalistic pride over the annexation of Crimea, optimism in Russia has dropped sharply. ### JUST WATCHED"

I said, well, it’s too early to say but right now I say we’re competitors ― but for the United States, and frankly the U.K. and other places, to get along with Russia and China and all of these other places... that’s a good thing, that’s not a bad thing. That’s a really good thing.” ### WORLD EXCLUSIVE: ### — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) July 14, 2018 ### Morgan asked Trump about “ruthless” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who the president had lavishly praised after the pair held a summit in Singapore last month. ### “Sure he is, he’s ruthless, but so are others,” Trump said of Kim. “I mean, plenty of the people that I deal with are pretty ruthless people.” ### Trump told Morgan that he got along “great” with the dictator during their summit. He said Kim is “very smart, great personality, he’s funny and tough, good negotiator.” ### The president’s laudatory remarks about Putin and Kim come on the heels of a fractious visit to Europe, during which Trump further  alienated NATO allies  during meetings in Brussels and, during his stop in the U.K, exacerbated the  political difficulties  facing British Prime Minister Theresa May. ### Before Trump left the U.S. for Europe, Trump had predicted that his summit with Putin, scheduled for Monday in Helsinki, would be the “easiest” of all the meetings planned during his packed few days on the continent. ### “I have NATO. I have the U.K., which is in somewhat turmoil. And I have Putin. Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of them all,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday."

The building also offers plenty of places to pick up food gifts for friends from San Francisco. ### If you have a few extra minutes, be sure to step out onto the deck behind the building to look at the water, or head five minutes south to Rincon Park to check out the public art piece ""Cupid's Span"" and to take some photos with the Bay Bridge (which is spectacularly lit up at night ). ### Embarcadero Station (two hours) ### First-timers: ### The Ferry Building is a popular stop with tourists, but its selection of local restaurants and products — not to mention the Farmer's Market on Tuesdays, ### Image 3 of 25 ### Two extra hours (or more) for first timers: ### If you have more time, or kids that aren't too thrilled by food, there's the Exploratorium which features interactive science and physics exhibits that allow visitors to pull, prod and be hands-on with experiments (and incidentally teach you something in the process). ### If a hike sounds more like your thing, a 30-minute walk north along the Embarcadero will land you at the base of Telegraph Hill , which leads to Coit Tower .

(Fun fact: The original Palace Hotel began in 1875 on that same spot, but was rebuilt following its collapse during the 1906 earthquake) The restaurant is an excellent, albeit pricy, place for brunch or high tea — and incidentally is also the birthplace of Green Goddess salad dressing . ### After that, head north toward the Transamerica Pyramid and take a second to sit in the mini-forest of redwood trees planted at its base and enjoy the spectacular architecture of one of San Francisco's most recognizable structures. The building is unfortunately closed to the public, so head along Columbus Avenue where you'll see North Beach's Italian fare mingle with the edge of Chinatown's eateries. The building housing Cafe Zoetrope is a popular one to photograph (or stop in, especially for fans of Francis Ford Coppola, who owns the wine bar and cafe) and Comstock Saloon is another bar favorite, especially for those who like strong cocktails with a historical bent — the bar itself is meticulously preserved from 1907 .

If you're hungry, there's a number of long-established seafood restaurants along Jefferson Street to dine at, but it's also one of the few chances you may get to have an In-N-Out burger in the city, which is located a block and a half away from the cable car stop. ### less ### Two extra hours (or more): ### Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images ### Image 14 of 25 ### Embarcadero station (two hours) ### Return visitors: ### If you're not much of a person for shopping, or you just need some culture in your life, head south of Market towards the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

You don't have much time to get out of the airport, you have luggage with you and moving about in an unknown city can seem like big hurdles to overcome. ### Fortunately, San Francisco International Airport is convenient enough to make a quick detour to the city possible. With public transportation conveniently connecting the larger Bay Area to the airport, even if you have just a couple of hours to spare — not including security and flight check-in, however — one can easily pop into the city for a bite to eat or some quick city exploration. ### This guide is designed to get you out of the airport and into San Francisco via BART, with places to visit within walking distance. There are options for first-time visitors and return visitors, the high-end and the budget-conscious, as well as tried-and-true tourist experiences and places to blend in with locals. ### If you have a trusty map app on your smart phone along with an explorer's sensibility — and are good at keeping track of time, so you can make it to your connecting flight! — you can make your forced layover more functional and spend that time in a new city ... rather than looking through social media for the umpteenth time until your flight takes off. ### Now Playing: ### Google Earth gives an aerial view of the San Francisco and some of its most famous landmarks. ### Media: Google Earth ### Check out the slideshow above for suggestions on where to go, and read through the extra resources below to help make your trip into the city easier. ### Related Stories ### The best walking tours in San Francisco for all types of people ### Store your luggage ### The thought of dragging around your carry-on luggage in a new city is enough to discourage one from leaving the airport during a layover, but that doesn't have to be the case at SFO. The Airport Travel Agency located in the pre-security area of the airport can free you up of any burdensome luggage for a fee, of course. ### Price: $15-35 for 24-hour period (pricing varies by item and is subject to change) ### Hours: 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. ### BART ### Ditch the idea of renting a car if you're in San Francisco for less than 12 hours. Unless you plan on going outside of the city, a car won't be worth your time and you'll likely spend more time looking for parking than exploring the city. (Or even worse, dealing with having your car broken into .) Take it easy on yourself and use BART and its website to plan out a roundtrip to the San Francisco station of choice, and back. From the airport, travel time on BART should take 30 minutes or less. ### Price: Varies, depending on station, but the website features a fare calculator . ### Hours: Weekdays, 4:00 a.m. - Midnight; Saturday, 6:00 a.m. - Midnight; Sunday 8:00 a.m. - Midnight."

( ### Pablo Martinez Monsivais | AP ### By The Associated Press ### HELSINKI (AP) -- With a wink and a slouch, respectively, President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin opened their summit Monday as the American president declared that ""the world wants to see us get along."" Trump laid out a list of topics for discussion that notably did not include Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. ### ""We have not been getting along well for the last number of years,"" Trump said as he and Putin sat down at the Presidential Palace in Finland's capital. ""But I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship. ... I really think the world wants to see us get along."" ### Putin, for his part, said he and Trump have maintained regular contact by phone and meeting at international events but ""the time has come to have a thorough discussion on various international problems and sensitive issues."" He added: ""There are quite a few of them for us to pay attention to."" ### Putin struck a casual pose during Trump's remarks, slouching in his chair with his legs wide and eyes low. He nodded along to some of Trump's remarks before they were translated, showcasing his fluency in English. Trump leaned forward in his chair, his hands tented in front of him and frequently glancing over at the Russian president. At one point, he shot Putin a wink. After Trump concluded his remarks, American reporters shouted several questions about whether he would bring up election meddling during his discussions with Putin. ### Trump did not respond; Putin appeared to smirk. ### With that, the two leaders gave a quick handshake and their private meeting in the opulent Gothic Hall was under way. Just the two of them, each with a translator. ### The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States -- and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea -- for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow's aggression may go unchallenged. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming ""many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" ### The summit, which was being closely monitored by rattled world capitals, was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump's presidential campaign. Undeterred, the American president was set to go face to face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian's leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British queen, among many others. ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn't ""expect anything"" from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. Not mentioned: Election meddling or Syria. ### Trump said last week that he would raise the election-meddling issue with Putin, but said he didn't expect Putin to budge on his denials. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### They'll continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."" ### View Comments"

Meanwhile Putin lounged in his chair in an attempt to appear relaxed ### Body language expert Judi James said the men appeared agitated, pulled their jackets around as if preparing for a fight, and did not share any humorous moments ### The US President said he hoped for an 'extraordinary relationship' with Moscow before leaning across a small table to shake hands with the Russian leader. ### Trump said getting along with Russia would be a 'good thing, not a bad thing', in opening remarks in front of media while a sombre-looking Putin added: 'The time has come to talk in a substantive way.' ### After praising Russia's hosting of the World Cup, Trump spoke of 'great opportunities' for Washington and Moscow - but admitted they have not been getting along for the past two years. ### Trump and Putin are due to spend 90 minutes in one-on-one talks during which the US President said he plans to discuss nuclear issues, China and Trade. ### Putin's spokesman has said there is no set agenda for the meeting, and has remained vague about what topics he would like to raise. ### Possible topics of discussion include western sanctions against Russia, rejoining the G7 - an idea Trump floated recently - and increasing numbers of NATO troops in eastern Europe. ### Advertisement"

But beyond his apparent affinity for Putin, many in Washington have questioned why the president is sitting down with his Russian counterpart and what he seeks to accomplish. ### Here are five things to watch for when Trump and Putin meet in Helsinki: ### Election interference ### Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, already at the front of observers’ minds, has rocketed to the top of the agenda ahead of Monday’s summit. Deputy Attorney General  Rod Rosenstein  announced Friday  the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers  who allegedly hacked into the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic groups. The announcement comes just days before the Helsinki summit,  ramping up pressure  on Trump to raise the issue with Putin. But the president has long wavered on the matter, despite the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in the election. Just last month, Trump tweeted that “Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!” ### Trump has repeatedly highlighted that denial — which Putin made during their first face-to-face meeting at last year’s group of Group of 20 summit — as a way of downplaying the issue. “President Trump is now the outlier in his own administration, seemingly,” said a former Trump transition official. The president has promised multiple times to press Putin on election interference, saying Friday he would “absolutely firmly ask the question” when they meet. Trump has expressed a belief, however, there is not much he can do to deter their activity. “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it, I did it, you got me.’ There won’t be a Perry Mason here,” Trump said at a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. ### National security figures with ties to the White House hope Trump publicly warns Putin against interfering in the midterms and threatens the Russian leader with consequences. ### But the worst-case scenario they fear is Trump remaining silent on the issue and raising the possibility of lifting sanctions on Moscow, something that would fuel criticism from political opponents who believe he is too close to Putin. ### Democrats in Congress have called on Trump to cancel the summit entirely in response to the indictment, but there is no sign Trump is interested in doing so. ### Syria ### Trump has reportedly been eying a deal with Putin in Syria that is aimed at moving Iranian forces away from the border with Israel in exchange for withdrawing U.S. troops. But both U.S. and Russian officials have been reluctant to give ground on thorny issues such as troop levels or territory, and experts are not optimistic a deal will be made in Helsinki. “To me, this whole issue of expecting the Russians or hoping the Russians are going to deliver Iranian concessions in Syria is the triumph of blind hope over grim analysis,” said Robert Ford, former U.S. ambassador to Syria under former President Obama. ### Under the terms of a possible deal, Russia would promise to limit Iranian presence near Syria’s border with Israel and Jordan and, in turn, the U.S. would allow Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces to take control of the area. U.S. forces have an outpost in southern Syria near the border with Jordan and Iraq known as al Tanf, which Pentagon officials have said is key to ensuring Iran does not complete the Tehran-to-Beirut land bridge it desires. But under the reported deal, U.S. forces would leave al Tanf — and eventually Syria — altogether. Experts have warned Trump not to repeat the mistakes of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, when he did not come away with an ironclad plan for denuclearization. ### “If he buys a vague promise, then it looks like the Singapore summit where he gets some nice words without details from the other side of the summit table,” said Ford. ### Crimea ### Crimea has been at the heart of U.S.-Russia tensions since 2014. That’s when Russia annexed the peninsula off Ukraine, sparking a wave of international sanctions and other measures aimed at isolating Moscow. But Trump has repeatedly left the door open to recognizing Russia’s claim over Crimea during his meeting with Putin, even repeating Moscow’s talking point that it has a rightful claim to the territory because most residents speak Russian. The president stoked further concern this week when he again did not rule out the possibility during his press conference at the end of the tumultuous NATO summit. ### “That’s an interesting question, because long before I got here President Obama allowed that to happen, that was under his watch, not my watch,” Trump said. “What will happen with Crimea from this point on? That, I can’t tell you.” ### One of the post-Crimea punishments for Russia was getting booted from the then-Group of Eight world economic powers. But last month, on his way to the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said that should be reversed. “Russia should be in this meeting,” he said at the time. ""Why are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting?"" ### The U.S. and its European allies stepped up their military posture and exercises in Eastern Europe after the Crimea annexation. But after Trump unilaterally agreed to cancel joint military exercises with South Korea during his summit with North Korea’s Kim, allies are fearful of him doing the same with Putin. Republicans in Congress are cautioning Trump against a repeat performance. “I think the president should listen to his security council and our secretary of Defense and our NATO allies on anything of substance dealing with the U.S. military posture. We’ve got to be careful, we’ve got to be strong,” said Sen.  Richard Shelby  (R-Ala.), who recently led a congressional delegation to Russia. ### Arms control ### Trump has said one of his top priorities for the summit is arms control, a topic that could produce a rare opportunity for the U.S. and Russia to find common ground. Arms control advocates say Trump can score an easy win with Putin by agreeing to extend the New START Treaty for another five years. The treaty, negotiated by the Obama administration, caps the U.S. and Russia’s deployed nuclear warheads to 1,550 each and comes up for renewal in 2021. “[Renewal] would ensure that we do not return to a numerical arms race,” said Thomas Countryman, former assistant secretary of State on international security and nonproliferation. ### But most experts do not believe a decision on New START will come at the summit. Trump has dismissed the treaty as one of Obama’s “bad deals,” and it could take some convincing to get him on board. Republicans have argued the treaty should not be extended while Russia is in violation of a separate arms control agreement known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. That agreement, which has been credited with helping end the Cold War, bans ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. The United States has repeatedly accused Russia of violating the INF Treaty by developing and deploying a banned missile, a charge Moscow denies. ### The summit could provide an opportunity for Trump to address the INF violation directly with Putin, but experts say Russia has shown little appetite for reversing course. ### Stagecraft ### Even more than contentious policy issues, the visuals could be the most memorable part of the Trump-Putin summit. Trump and Putin  will hold a joint press conference , which should be a spectacle in and of itself and give U.S. media a chance to rare opportunity to press the Russian leader on election meddling and other key issues. It could cause problems for Trump if he appears too friendly with Putin, especially given the timing of the meeting, just days after the hacking indictments. ### But Trump’s desire to form a close bond with Putin could lead the president to give his Russian counterpart a warm reception, just like he did with Kim in Singapore. It could fuel criticism back home that Trump has a greater affinity for strongmen than he does for longtime U.S. allies. ### Days before the summit, Trump was shown grimacing during a group photo with NATO partners in Brussels and rolled his eyes when he was asked during a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May about critical comments he made about the U.K. leader. Putin, a former KGB officer with a flair for the dramatic, could also have some tricks up his sleeve. ### The Russian leader  frequently shows up late  for meetings with world leaders, even forcing Pope Francis to wait for 50 minutes before a 2015 sit-down in Vatican City. Putin even brought his pet Labrador to a 2007 meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has a well-known fear of dogs. The Russian president later said he did not mean to scare Merkel and claimed he apologized after learning she is scared of dogs. ### *  *  * ### And in case it's not immediately obvious, as Jim Jatras recently noted, there are many reasons the bipartisan US establishment hates Trump. His heresies from neoliberal orthodoxies on immigration and trade are prominent. But top among them is his oft-stated intention to improve relations with Russia. ### That’s fighting words for the Deep State and its mainstream media arm, for which demonizing Russia and its president Vladimir Putin is an obsession. ### The fact that Donald Trump made his intention to get along with Moscow a priority during his 2016 campaign, both against his Republican primary rivals and Hillary Clinton (who has compared Putin to Hitler) was cause for alarm. This is because far more than even the frightening prospect that the 70-year state of war on the Korean Peninsula might end, US reconciliation with Russia would yank the rug out from under the phony justifications for spending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to counter a “threat” that ceased to exist over a quarter century ago. Absent hostility to Russia that money has no reason to keep sustaining the power, privilege, and prosperity of a horde of moochers and profiteers, both at home and abroad. ### That’s why when it was reported soon after his January 2017 inauguration that Trump was seeking to open dialogue with the Kremlin and set an early summit with Putin there was a hysterical counteraction. ### *  *  * ### Finally, watch out for any 'hot mic' incidents, because it would very awkward if a president on the United States was caught offering himself up to a Russian leader... ### Trump never colluded with the Russians, but guess who did? 👇 pic.twitter.com/5dzmR1lFyK"

Trump Is About To Give It To Him. ### Guest Writer ### Jorge Silva / Reuters ### On Monday, President Donald Trump will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. This summit ― their first bilateral meeting ― is unlikely to produce a significant shift in U.S.-Russia relations, but it will be symbolically important for both leaders. ### For Trump, this meeting, like the one last month with North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore, offers a chance to be seen making progress with a leader with whom other statesmen, including former President Barack Obama , had problems. Putin, for his part, is looking to ease tensions with the U.S. while underscoring to Russians the respect that he has won with his aggressive foreign policy. ### The practical goal of the summit for Putin is an agreement to begin normalizing U.S.-Russia relations. This is what Konstantin Kosachev, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of Russia’s Federation Council, suggested in a recent interview . Recent research by the well-respected Russian polling agency Levada Center shows that the Russian public is also in favor of such a course of action . A majority of Russians have negative feelings toward the U.S., but most also want an end to the hostile rhetoric between the two countries and see avenues for productive cooperation. ### But the Russian desire for reconciliation comes with a catch: Russia wants respect, even as it moves toward rapprochement. Many Russians believe that their nation is treated unfairly by the international community, held to a different standard and denied the respect it is due. ### The Russian desire for reconciliation comes with a catch: Russia wants respect, even as it moves toward rapprochement. ### The image of Russia as a besieged fortress ― surrounded by foes with only itself to rely on ― has long had resonance among Russian citizens. This is the result of historical experience, and it is a long-standing trope in Russian political rhetoric . ### After Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014, the U.S. and European states imposed a series of sanctions , and the argument that Russia was being singled out and targeted became especially convincing. Many Russians believe these responses were unjust, and that they punished Russia for actions similar to unilateral military interventions undertaken by Western states. ### Putin has famously called the collapse of the Soviet Union “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.” Russia lost its near-abroad empire, suffered through a decade of socio-economic chaos and was sidelined from a key role in major international events like the war in Kosovo. ### While Russians recognize that the world is unlikely to return to the bipolar configuration of the Cold War era, many welcome Putin’s aggressive stance toward Russia’s neighbors as evidence that the former superpower is reasserting itself on the world stage. While Russians want a resumption of normal relations with the U.S., they also want their country to be treated as America’s equal. ### Respect is something that Putin can get from Trump in Helsinki. The American president has expressed his admiration for Putin on numerous occasions. He marveled at Putin’s high domestic support, and engaged in moral equivalency to dismiss questions about Putin’s violent treatment of opponents, saying: “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?” ### Since assuming office, Trump has time and again spoken about his desire for a good relationship with Russia and his personal willingness to work with Putin. In recent comments, Trump said that he saw Russia as a “ competitor ,” rather than a friend or foe. ### The image of Russia as a besieged fortress – surrounded by foes with only itself to rely on – has long had resonance among Russian citizens. ### These kinds of statements help shore up support for Putin at home and worry American allies. While Trump respects Putin’s leadership style, European powers see him as a “ spoiler ,” a state leader interested in fostering discord ―  supporting right-wing political parties, influencing elections and authorizing covert actions against spies ― in order to tilt the structure of international relations in his favor. ### Putin has been able to turn his aggressive foreign policy into a ratings boost at home, and he may use any positive comments by Trump emerging from Helsinki in the same way. ### Beyond putting on a mutual show of respect, Trump and Putin may also use the summit to discuss some topics on which they agree. They may commiserate over their shared displeasure with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Trump has been highly critical of fellow members of NATO for not paying their share for mutual defense. Putin has often criticized NATO for its expansion eastward following the collapse of the USSR, and he  benefits from any visible divisions within the alliance. ### Trump and Putin are likely to talk about Ukraine. Earlier this year, Trump reportedly told G7 leaders that Crimea belongs in Russia because of the preponderance of Russian speakers there. This understanding of Russian identity ― that it extends to all Russian speakers ― is one of the pillars of the Kremlin’s efforts to justify its annexation of the peninsula. The president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, is certainly worried about what could emerge fro the talks in Helsinki, writing in an Op-Ed for The Financial Times that “based on our agreed approach of doing nothing on Ukraine without Ukraine, I wish Mr. Trump well in his effort to bring Mr. Putin back into line.” ### MAXIM ZMEYEV via Getty Images ### Last but not least, the two leaders are bound to talk about Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump had already promised to pursue the topic before leaving Washington, but the subject gained new traction after the indictment by a Washington grand jury of 12 Russian nationals on Friday. ### In the past, Trump has very readily accepted Putin’s denials of interfering in the election. His personal trust in Putin is baffling and stands in stark contrast to findings by U.S. intelligence agencies, which confirmed Russian cyberattacks during the campaign and resulted in new sanctions . ### The White House and Trump supporters are already playing down the significance of the indictments, calling the hacking “ alleged .” Yet the investigation’s focus on the actions of members of the Russian military intelligence agency makes Putin’s previous claims that any cyberattacks were the work of individuals rather than the state far less sustainable. ### If pressed, Putin may rebut Trump’s questions by asking to see proof of a connection to the Russian government. However, no one should hold their breath for any frank admissions from Putin or hard questions from Trump in Helsinki. ### While it is unclear what Trump can gain from the Helsinki meeting, Putin will undoubtedly use the meeting to furbish both his domestic and international legitimacy. ###  ### Yana Gorokhovskaia holds a Ph.D. in political science. She is a postdoctoral research fellow in Russian politics at the Harriman Institute for Russian, Eurasian and Eastern European Studies at Columbia University. ### ALSO ON HUFFPOST OPINION"

Gen. Rod Rosenstein announced Friday, became the latest partisan ammunition in the politicized battle over the investigation led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. ### The White House quickly fired back, saying the Helsinki summit was still on. ### ""Today's charges include no allegations of knowing involvement by anyone on the campaign and no allegations that the alleged hacking affected the election result,"" Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement. ""This is consistent with what we have been saying all along."" ### The indictment charges a dozen Russians for hacking computer networks used by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee, state election offices and other entities. U.S. intelligence agencies have said the Kremlin sought to undermine Clinton's chances and to help Trump win by leaking stolen emails, using fake social media accounts, and other techniques. ### ""Glad-handing with Vladimir Putin on the heels of these indictments would be an insult to our democracy,"" Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Friday. Unless Russia takes ""demonstrable and transparent steps"" to guarantee it won't interfere in future elections, the summit should be canceled, he said. ### Other top Democrats joined his call, arguing that Trump must confront Putin over the indictment -- or cancel his first formal summit with the Russian president. ### ""There should be no one-on-one meeting between this president and Mr. Putin,"" Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told a news conference. ""There needs to be other Americans in the room."" ### He said the meeting should be canceled unless Trump makes the indictment a ""top priority"" on the summit agenda. ### The ""charges provide hard evidence that Russian intel agents attacked America to boost their favorite candidates, undermine others, and influence our elections,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said on Twitter. She told Trump to ""cancel your ridiculous Putin summit and get your butt on a plane back to the United States."" ### Eighteen Democratic members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee signed a letter Friday raising concerns about Trump's disparaging comments about U.S. allies at the NATO summit this week and his plan to meet Putin alone on Monday before a broader session with their advisors. ### ""Unfortunately, due to your constant expressions of sympathy for Vladimir Putin, your conflicts of interest, and your attacks on our closest allies, we do not have confidence that you can faithfully negotiate with the Russian leader, and we urge you to cancel the meeting,"" the letter stated. ### The latest indictment comes after Mueller had obtained a related indictment against 13 other Russians in February. None is likely to see the inside of a U.S. courtroom because the United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia. ### Republican lawmakers roundly denounced the latest evidence of Russian meddling, though few called for the cancellation of the meeting or other penalties. ### RELATED: Everything you need to know about who's been charged in the Russia case » ### House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) said Trump should use the Helsinki summit to challenge Putin on the charges outlined in the indictment, Russian aggression in Ukraine, and its military support for Syrian President Bashar Assad. ### Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said if Trump ""is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward."" ### Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said on Twitter that the Russian cyberattack was ""not a Republican or a Democrat view -- it is simply the reality."" He added: ""All patriotic Americans should understand that Putin is not America's friend, and he is not the president's buddy."" ### ""I've said consistently that Russia worked to undermine our elections in the U.S.,"" Sen.

(Brendan SmialowskiI / AFP/Getty Images) ### Eli Stokols, Sabra Ayres ### President Trump opened his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, hours after blaming the frosty state of relations between the two countries on his own government. ### “We have a lot of questions, and hopefully we'll come up with answers. It's great to be with you,"" Trump said as he and the Russian leader met, offering his hand to Putin. ### Among the issues to be discussed, he listed trade, nuclear weapons and China, making no mention of Russia’s interference in the U.S. election, the poisoning of people in Britain by a Russian nerve agent or the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. ### ""We have not been getting along,” Trump said, “but I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship."" ### “Getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing,"" he added. ### Putin said little, offering a more casual, almost indifferent demeanor as Trump spoke. He said he looked forward to “continuing the dialogue we have started.” ### The two leaders were scheduled to meet for 90 minutes, with only interpreters in the room, at Finland's presidential palace, an ornate yellow-colored building adjacent to the city's harbor. ### Putin, as he often has in meetings with other foreign leaders, arrived 45 minutes late, his plane touching down at the time when his first meeting with Trump was originally scheduled to begin. ### Following the meetings, the two leaders were scheduled to hold a joint news conference, although it's unclear if they will take questions from reporters or simply make statements. ### Trump, who has sought a better relationship with the Russian autocrat, has casually lowered expectations for Monday's talks and been remarkably open about not having a clear agenda, even as he's mentioned several discussion topics he plans to bring up. ### On Monday morning, he fired off a tweet blaming the U.S. for the poor state of relations between the two countries. ### Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs ""liked"" the tweet from its official account — not a surprise, given Trump's eagerness to blame his own government, not Putin, who sanctioned Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials. ### Hours later, shortly after Putin's plane touched down in Helsinki, the same Russian account retweeted Trump's statement with the comment: ""We agree."" ### Dating back to his presidential campaign, Trump has raised eyebrows with his approach to Putin, offering comments notably more conciliatory than those typical of American politicians. His statements about the Russian have stood in stark contrast to his often harsh and insulting rhetoric toward other world leaders and his political adversaries in both parties."

All rights reserved.) ### For all the rhetoric about how – and more importantly, why -- President Trump praises Putin but criticizes allies, we now have a real situation on our hands:  the United States government has formally accused agents of the Russian government of seeking to interfere with our 2016 presidential election.  As if the stakes were not high enough to begin with, the importance of the Trump-Putin Summit has increased exponentially. ### If there is one thing the president and his aides should be working on between rounds of golf at his club in Scotland, it is exactly how the president will look and what he will say on the first handshake with Putin in Helsinki.  This is not a reunion of frat buddies or old friends.  This is a meeting of two powerful, competitive leaders at a time of great tension in the relationship between their nations, caused by one seeking to undermine the very foundation of the other’s form of government. ### I was directly involved in the planning and execution of all five of Ronald Reagan’s Summit meetings with Mikhail Gorbachev (Geneva, Reykjavik, Washington, Moscow and New York) and in all the planning we did for the first Summit, we failed to recommend what the president should say on the first handshake with Gorbachev.  We should have known how closely the press would pay attention to the two leaders’ first in-person words to each other, and we were remiss in not suggesting some things to the president to say that would seize the upper hand in the battle for attention.  As usual, Reagan was good mannered and let Gorbachev speak first, and as a result, the charismatic and media-savvy Gorbachev won the initial PR battle.  Reagan eventually recovered, but only after considerable scrambling on the part of White House aides. ### When Trump first meets Putin, then, smiles and vigorous handshakes are inappropriate.  A stern – even slightly angry expression – which is the norm for Donald Trump, and a firm, but quick handshake, would immediately set the right tone.  No pats on the back, indeed, no physical contact other than a handshake.  The body language should say that the United States knows what Russia did (and is still doing), we’re angry about it and it will not be tolerated. ### From an opening words standpoint, the president should speak first and know exactly what he is going to say. ### From an opening words standpoint, the president should speak first and know exactly what he is going to say.  The press and world at large will literally be hanging on what is said and it would behoove the president to have the right words ready.  Here’s a couple of suggestions: ### 1) “Mr. President (NOT Vladimir), we meet at a serious time.  I do not like what your country tried to do to ours.  We have lots to discuss.  Let’s get to it.” ### 2) Mr. President, there were those in my country who did not want this meeting to take place.  But there are some deeply disturbing issues between us that cannot be ignored.” ### Then walk off expressionless to the meeting room. ### What the president wants (and I would argue, needs) is to conduct himself in a way that causes reporters to write: “In look and words, US President Donald J. Trump, made it plain to Russian President Vladimir Putin that he was angry about Russian attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections, and that he would put the issue to Putin directly at their Summit in Helsinki…” ### Anything less will leave the president vulnerable to accusations of being too soft on Putin, and even his base does not like that. ### The Trump team should not make the same mistake we did in Reagan’s first summit with Gorbachev. Especially in the social media, 24-hour, instant-news world, there will not be a second chance for Trump to make a first impression. ### Mark D.

Still, brave souls try. ### Posted July 15, 2018 at 10:05 AM | Updated July 15, 2018 at 10:06 AM ### Comment ### By Allison Pries | NJ Advance Media ### We all know voting is a civic duty -- one that we don't often carry out (voter turnout in last November's election was at an all-time low , about 35 percent). ### But, as it turns out, the few who actually choose our local elected representatives yield even more power than we thought. Because, once somebody is in office in Jersey, it's really rare that that's going to change. ### Don't get us wrong, it can. New Jerseyans can recall their mayors, council people, and others. But, doing it is a long process, and it's not often successful. ### Screen Shot 2018-07-06 at 3.26.52 PM.jpg ### NJ.gov ### What is a recall? ### The idea behind it is pretty simple -- the recall process allows citizens to remove and replace an elected official before the end of his or her term. The state constitution allows citizens to recall any elected official in the state or representing New Jersey in the U.S. Congress after one year in office. ### Recalls of state officials are permitted in 19 states and the District of Columbia. And the recall of local officials are allowed in at least 29 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. ### Screen Shot 2018-07-10 at 10.00.50 AM.jpg ### file photo ### How did it start? ### New Jersey voters approved a ballot question that gave them the authority to recall elected officials in the Nov. 1993 election. It was spurred by outrage over Gov. Jim Florio's 1990 tax increase. Prior to that, only certain municipalities and counties allowed recalls of elected officials. ### What is the recall process? ### Three residents must file a notice of intention  to recall the politician with the election official for the district. The official will review it within three business days and notify the targeted person of the recall. ### Once the petition is approved, the recall committee has 160 days to collect signatures from 25 percent of the registered voters in the district. For recalls of U.S. Senators or governors, the petitioners have 320 days to collect signatures. ### The submitted signatures are reviewed by the election official within 10 business days and, if certified, a recall election is scheduled. ### Screen Shot 2018-07-11 at 2.35.08 PM.jpg ### File photo ### Options for the recalled official ### The elected official can challenge the signatures or the manner by which the recall petitions were executed in court. ### He or she can also run for their office on the same ballot that the recall question appears. ### And, it's Jersey politics, so you know that's happened. Former West New York Mayor Anthony M. DeFino, in 1993 , was recalled from office and elected mayor again on the same day."
8403,beforeitsnews.com,2018-07-15T06:25:32-04:00,"Murray: ‘The Holes in the Official Skripal Story’ ### Saturday, July 14, 2018 12:34 ### % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents. ### In my last post I set out the official Government account of the events in the Skripal Case. ### Here I examine the credibility of this story. Next week I shall look at alternative explanations. ### Russia has a decade long secret programme of producing and stockpiling novichok nerve agents. It also has been training agents in secret assassination techniques, and British intelligence has a copy of the Russian training manual, which includes instruction on painting nerve agent on doorknobs. ### The only backing for this statement by Boris Johnson is alleged “intelligence”, and unfortunately the “intelligence” about Russia’s secret novichok programme comes from exactly the same people who brought you the intelligence about Saddam Hussein’s WMD programme, proven liars. Furthermore, the question arises why Britain has been sitting on this intelligence for a decade and doing nothing about it, including not telling the OPCW inspectors who certified Russia’s chemical weapons stocks as dismantled. ### If Russia really has a professional novichok assassin training programme, why was the assassination so badly botched? Surely in a decade of development they would have discovered that the alleged method of gel on doorknob did not work? And where is the training manual which Boris Johnson claimed to possess? Having told the world – including Russia -the UK has it, what is stopping the UK from producing it, with marks that could identify the specific copy erased? ### The Russians chose to use this assassination programme to target Sergei Skripal, a double agent who had been released from jail in Russia some eight years previously. ### It seems remarkable that the chosen target of an attempt that would blow the existence of a secret weapon and end the cover of a decade long programme, should be nobody more prominent than a middle ranking double agent who the Russians let out of jail years ago. If they wanted him dead they could have killed him then. Furthermore the attack on him would undermine all future possible spy swaps. Putin therefore, on this reading, was willing to sacrifice both the secrecy of the novichok programme and the spy swap card just to attack Sergei Skripal. That seems highly improbable. ### Only the Russians can make novichok and only the Russians had a motive to attack the Skripals. ### The nub of the British government’s approach has been the shocking willingness of the corporate and state media to parrot repeatedly the lie that the nerve agent was Russian made, even after Porton Down said they could not tell where it was made and the OPCW confirmed that finding. In fact, while the Soviet Union did develop the “novichok” class of nerve agents, the programme involved scientists from all over the Soviet Union, especially Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia, as I myself learnt when I visited the newly decommissioned Nukus testing facility in Uzbekistan in 2002. ### Furthermore, it was the USA who decommissioned the facility and removed equipment back to the United States. At least two key scientists from the programme moved to the United States. Formulae for several novichok have been published for over a decade. The USA, UK and Iran have definitely synthesised a number of novichok formulae and almost certainly others have done so too. Dozens of states have the ability to produce novichok, as do many sophisticated non-state actors. ### As for motive, the Russian motive might be revenge, but whether that really outweighs the international opprobrium incurred just ahead of the World Cup, in which so much prestige has been invested, is unclear. ### What is certainly untrue is that only Russia has a motive. The obvious motive is to attempt to blame and discredit Russia. Those who might wish to do this include Ukraine and Georgia, with both of which Russia is in territorial dispute, and those states and jihadist groups with which Russia is in conflict in Syria. The NATO military industrial complex also obviously has a plain motive for fueling tension with Russia. ### There is of course the possibility that Skripal was attacked by a private gangster interest with which he was in conflict, or that the attack was linked to Skripal’s MI6 handler Pablo Miller’s work on the Orbis/Steele Russiagate dossier on Donald Trump. ### Plainly, the British governments statements that only Russia had the means and only Russia had the motive, are massive lies on both counts. ### The Russians had been tapping the phone of Yulia Skripal. They decided to attack Sergei Skripal while his daughter was visiting from Moscow. ### In an effort to shore up the government narrative, at the time of the Amesbury attack the security services put out through Pablo Miller’s long term friend, the BBC’s Mark Urban, that the Russians “may have been” tapping Yulia Skripal’s phone, and the claim that this was strong evidence that the Russians had indeed been behind the attack. ### But think this through. If that were true, then the Russians deliberately attacked at a time when Yulia was in the UK rather than when Sergei was alone. Yet no motive has been adduced for an attack on Yulia or why they would attack while Yulia was visiting – they could have painted his doorknob with less fear of discovery anytime he was alone. Furthermore, it is pretty natural that Russian intelligence would tap the phone of Yulia, and of Sergei if they could. The family of double agents are normal targets. I have no doubt in the least, from decades of experience as a British diplomat, that GCHQ have been tapping Yulia’s phone. Indeed, if tapping of phones is seriously put forward as evidence of intent to murder, the British government must be very murderous indeed. ### Their trained assassin(s) painted a novichok on the doorknob of the Skripal house in the suburbs of Salisbury. Either before or after the attack, they entered a public place in the centre of Salisbury and left a sealed container of the novichok there. ### The incompetence of the assassination beggars belief when compared to British claims of a long term production and training programme. The Russians built the heart of the International Space Station. They can kill an old bloke in Salisbury. Why did the Russians not know that the dose from the door handle was not fatal? Why would trained assassins leave crucial evidence lying around in a public place in Salisbury? Why would they be conducting any part of the operation with the novichok in a public area in central Salisbury? ### Why did nobody see them painting the doorknob? This must have involved wearing protective gear, which would look out of place in a Salisbury suburb. With Skripal being resettled by MI6, and a former intelligence officer himself, it beggars belief that MI6 did not fit, as standard, some basic security including a security camera on his house. ### The Skripals both touched the doorknob and both functioned perfectly normally for at least five hours, even able to eat and drink heartily. Then they were simultaneously and instantaneously struck down by the nerve agent, at a spot in the city centre coincidentally close to where the assassins left a sealed container of the novichok lying around. Even though the nerve agent was eight times more deadly than Sarin or VX, it did not kill the Skripals because it had been on the doorknob and affected by rain. ### Why did they both touch the outside doorknob in exiting and closing the door? Why did the novichok act so very slowly, with evidently no feeling of ill health for at least five hours, and then how did it strike both down absolutely simultaneously, so that neither can call for help, despite their being different sexes, weights, ages, metabolisms and receiving random completely uncontrolled doses. The odds of that happening are virtually nil. And why was the nerve agent ultimately ineffective? ### Detective Sergeant Bailey attended the Skripal house and was also poisoned by the doorknob, but more lightly. None of the other police who attended the house were affected. ### Why was the Detective Sergeant affected and nobody else who attended the house, or the scene where the Skripals were found? Why was Bailey only lightly affected by this extremely deadly substance, of which a tiny amount can kill? ### Four months later, Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess were rooting about in public parks, possibly looking for cigarette butts, and accidentally came into contact with the sealed container of a novichok. They were poisoned and Dawn Sturgess subsequently died. ### If the nerve agent had survived four months because it was in a sealed container, why has this sealed container now mysteriously disappeared again? If Rowley and Sturgess had direct contact straight from the container, why did they not both die quickly? Why had four months searching of Salisbury and a massive police, security service and military operation not found this container, if Rowley and Sturgess could? ### I am, with a few simple questions, demolishing what is the most ludicrous conspiracy theory I have ever heard – the Salisbury conspiracy theory being put forward by the British government and its corporate lackies. ### My next post will consider some more plausible explanations of this affair."

The second is the alleged hacking and intrusion into the Democratic Party's emails and state voter data, which is covered in the most recent set of charges. ### Read More ### A third line of inquiry, which Mueller is still investigating and which may still yield charges, is Russia's alleged attempt to funnel illegal campaign contributions using individuals or organizations in the United States. ### Asha Rangappa ### Importantly, the most recent indictment directly identifies Russia as the actor behind the computer hacking efforts during the election. The earlier indictment against the Russian individuals and companies involved in social media disinformation included entities like the Internet Research Agency, Russia's ""troll farm,"" which has close ties to the Kremlin but is not an official state entity. ### By contrast, the current charges name intelligence officers from the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency (roughly analogous to our Defense Intelligence Agency), as defendants. That would mean that if the allegations are true, President Vladimir Putin himself authorized their actions. ### Why charging Russians is important ### Mueller does not expect to ever get the GRU officials he charged into a courtroom, considering that Putin will never voluntary extradite them to the US. Nevertheless, he achieves several goals by indicting them. ### Most importantly, the indictment offers Mueller a vehicle to explain to the American public exactly how Russia hacked into political party and state election emails and voter data. This is critical because unlike, say, a terrorist attack -- which would be visible and leave clear evidence of destruction behind -- Russia's active measures are covert, and therefore not apparent to the general public. ### When combined with the President's own assertions that claims of Russian election interference are a ""hoax,"" Americans could be skeptical that any such attack took place at all. These indictments provide indisputable facts and evidence to support the US intelligence community's attribution of election hacking to Russia and brings to light an otherwise invisible attack."
8461,hotair.com,2018-07-15T14:23:27-04:00,"— This Week (@ThisWeekABC) July 15, 2018 ### I’m sure the president will be very stern indeed in confronting Putin about these troubling allegations. He admitted this morning in a different interview that it hadn’t occurred to him to even ask Putin to extradite the 12 GRU officials whom Mueller indicted. All of this is check-the-box stuff for him. Per Axios : ### President Trump no longer doubts the basic intelligence assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election — he just seems incapable of taking it seriously, and tells staff that is simply what nations do, several sources close to Trump tell me. ### Between the lines: There is no evidence that could ever change Trump’s mind, the sources said… ### To the extent that Trump does confront Putin over meddling at tomorrow’s summit in Finland with Vladimir Putin — and the president has publicly promised to — it’s not with any genuine seriousness or enthusiasm, the sources say. ### It’ll be purely for domestic/media consumption. Trump has signaled as much in the sarcastic way he’s talked about this with the press. ### Picture Trump dismissing Russian meddling as “simply what nations do” if he had lost the election and evidence came out that Moscow had interfered to try to aid Hillary. We’d be getting new “the system is rigged” tweets to this day. Along with loads of “it’s simply what nations do” defenses from liberals, natch. ### Contra Bolton, Friday’s indictments obviously weaken Trump’s hand in Helsinki. The public’s just been given the most detailed evidence yet that the Russian government tried to damage his opponent in 2016; good luck selling Americans on some grand bargain with Putin under those circumstances, when they’ve just been reminded that he was aligned with your presidential effort. Pressure was already on Trump per his overhyped reputation as a master negotiator not to get rolled in talks with Russia. After the indictments, any meaningful U.S. concession, even in the context of a “good” deal, will be attacked as a payoff for Moscow for helping Trump two years ago. And of course, because of Trump’s weird, suspicious habit of never criticizing Putin, anything sanguine he says about Russia this week after the summit will clang against the reality of what Mueller described in Friday’s filing. Essentially, to not sound weak in light of the indictments, he’ll have to sound uncharacteristically un-Trumpy. ### Bolton’s on firmer ground here: ### National security adviser John Bolton tells @jonkarl he finds it ""hard to believe"" that Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin was unaware of Russian interference in 2016 presidential election https://t.co/vAH7qxj8wS #ThisWeek pic.twitter.com/uvYCZvnCw2 ### — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) July 15, 2018 ### It’s impossible to believe Putin didn’t know. With Russia expecting Clinton to win, any sabotage operation aimed at her campaign would have involved potentially major blowback for Putin and Moscow once she was sworn in. It’s absurd to think that Russian intelligence would freelance with stakes as high as that instead of seeking the top guy’s authorization. Interestingly, Bolton notes in the clip that when he met with Putin a few weeks ago, the tsar told him that whether or not Russians were involved in campaign hacking, the Russian state wasn’t — now directly contradicted by Mueller’s filing. Will Trump raise that? Will Bolton, assuming he’s involved in any meetings with Putin? ### One more soundbite for you, this time from our ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman : ### In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” Huntsman said that he had “very little doubt” that Moscow was working to interfere in the 2018 races, adding that Washington had put Russia “on notice” for the alleged efforts. ### “We have an election coming up in November and if there is meddling in the election this November like we saw in 2016, we’re not going to have much of a relationship left,” Huntsman said. ### Is that true? A really brazen attempt to interfere might backfire on Russia by making Trump look like a chump who’s unable or unwilling to keep foreign hands out of our elections. But what about something that’s more plausibly deniable, and what if it benefits Republicans? A recurring explanation for Trump’s indifference to 2016 meddling (noted again today by Axios) is that it bugs him to think his glorious victory was somehow the handiwork of anyone but him and his own genius. He views the Russiagate hype as an attempt to steal credit. The same dynamic would be at work this fall if Russia pulls something while Trump is out on the trail campaigning hard for Republicans. If the GOP benefits from interference, we’ll once again have a case of the media questioning the legitimacy of a Trump-backed political victory, one that’ll benefit him by keeping Congress (or at least the Senate) in Republican hands. Why would that damage our relationship with Russia? Is there a single example of Trump getting genuinely indignant about someone’s behavior when he benefited from it? His mind doesn’t work that way. ### Two more (amusing) short clips of Bolton for you below in lieu of an exit question. Jon Karl tries pressing him in both about just how far Trump might be willing to go on concessions. Recognizing Russian sovereignty over Crimea? Suspending U.S. military exercises? Bolton just … won’t rule anything out. Even he’s not sure what Trump might be willing to give up. In the second clip, Karl asks him point blank whether Putin should be trusted, to which Bolton feebly replies that he’s merely the national security advisor, not the national-security decision-maker. In other words, “No, but I just work here, buddy.” Real vote of confidence there in your boss’s approach, John. ### National Security adviser John Bolton on whether Pres. Trump will make concessions during his meeting with Russian Pres.

For Putin, the meeting is a win even before it began, as it helps restore an image of parity with the U.S. that Russia lost after the collapse of the Soviet Union. ### ""We have a lot of good things to talk about, and things to talk about,"" Trump said before shaking hands with the Russian leader. ""We have discussions on everything from trade to military to missiles to nuclear to China."" ### He didn't mention the indictments or the Kremlin's interference in the U.S. election. ### In a bit of gamesmanship, Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half-hour late, while Trump didn't depart the resort home where he was meeting with advisers for the summit until after the Russian leader arrived at the presidential palace. The meeting was delayed about an hour as a result. ### ""It is now time to talk in depth about our bilateral ties and sore points in the world,"" Putin said in Russian.

The Russian agents are accused of hacking email accounts controlled by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign, and publicizing messages. The indictments raised the stakes for the Helsinki summit, even as aides to both Trump and Putin ratcheted down expectations. ### Trump said in an interview with CBS News broadcast on Sunday that he may ask the Russian president to extradite the agents to the U.S. On Monday, he blamed Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the election interference for poor relations between the U.S. and Russia, rather than the Kremlin activities that the Department of Justice began probing in 2016. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!""

He continued to castigate U.S. allies during his visit to the U.K., where he involved himself in the internal affairs of British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ### The president also said in a CBS News interview broadcast on Sunday that the European Union is an American ""foe"" for ""what they do to us in trade."" He called Russia a ""foe in certain respects."" Trump said at breakfast with Niinisto that the NATO summit was ""very successful."" ### ""They're paying and they're paying more rapidly and I think NATO's probably never been stronger than it is today,"" he said. ### Trump argues that by urging higher defense spending by NATO countries, he is raising pressure on Moscow. But he continues to face questions about whether he's playing into the hands of Putin, who has long sought to exacerbate and exploit tensions among Western allies. ### ""I really think the world wants to see us get along,"" Trump said. ""We are the two great nuclear powers, we have 90 percent of the nuclear. And that's not a good thing, it's a bad thing, and I think we can hopefully do something about that."" ### The U.S. president has expressed reluctance to hold Putin to account for Moscow's election meddling and has indicated he accepts the Russian president's denials at face value. But U.S. lawmakers of both parties said following Friday's indictments, which resulted from Mueller's probe, that Trump must either confront Putin in Helsinki or cancel the meeting in protest. ### Trump deflected responsibility for confronting Moscow, saying in tweets and interviews that former President Barack Obama had done nothing to prevent the hacks of Democratic email accounts or to punish the Russians afterward. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday that the indictments were baseless and had been timed to poison the mood ahead of the summit. Putin has allowed that non-state actors in Russia -- people he likened to ""artists"" -- may have taken it upon themselves to launch cyberattacks on Clinton's campaign and the DNC. ### The drama between Trump and Putin will play out at the imposing 19th Century presidential palace in Helsinki. Several Senate Democrats wrote to Trump on Saturday to warn him against meeting alone with Putin, to no avail. ### Officials at the Kremlin and the White House say Putin and Trump will discuss many of the issues causing the most friction between the countries. That includes Russia's military incursions into Ukraine and Syria, the Iranian presence in Syria, Russian hostility toward U.S. allies, the arrests of Russian nationals abroad and renewing international arms control treaties. ### ""This is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama, and quite frankly some of the danger, out of the relationship,"" Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, said Sunday. ### One possible outcome of the summit is renegotiation of a nuclear treaty that expires in 2021. Putin may update Trump on negotiations for pro-Iranian militias in Syria to withdraw from areas near Israel in favor of government troops. The Russian leader meanwhile wants to discuss the U.S. seizure of Russian diplomatic properties in the U.S. as punishment for the 2016 election meddling, as well as the arrests of Russian citizens in third countries at Washington's request. ### Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Saturday on RT that the aim of the meeting is merely to open what he called ""frozen"" channels of communication. Russia was kicked out of the Group of Eight nations after its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Relations have further degraded over Putin's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war, and a nerve-agent poisoning this year of a former Russian spy living in Britain that the U.K. government has pinned on Moscow. ### - - - ### Bloomberg's Toluse Olorunnipa and Henry Meyer contributed. ### Most Popular"
8634,cnn.com,2018-07-16T01:49:31-04:00,"11 times Donald Trump praised Vladimir Putin ### Analysis by Chris Cillizza , CNN Editor-at-large ### Updated 1:28 AM ET, Mon July 16, 2018 ### Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. ### (CNN) ### President Donald Trump can find a mean word to say about almost anyone: Pope Francis, a Gold Star family, Arizona Sen. John McCain, a disabled reporter, and on and on and on. ### One person appears to be an exception to that rule: Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### Time and time again over his nearly 18 months in office, Trump has resisted saying anything bad about Putin. Which is weird because, well, Russia conducted a broad and deep attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election. And which is relevant because Trump is meeting with Putin on Monday, despite the fact that special counsel Robert Mueller indicted a dozen Russians on Friday because of their connections to the election meddling operation. ### I asked Point-er Brenna Williams to dig up everything -- or as much as she could find -- Trump has said about Putin since he was inaugurated in January 2017. Though not a comprehensive list, here are some of the most notable things the President has said about his Russian counterpart -- in reverse chronological order. ( You can also see what Trump said about Putin -- HINT: It's almost all nice stuff -- before he became President .) ### 1. ""Congratulations to France, who played extraordinary soccer, on winning the 2018 World Cup. Additionally, congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament -- one of the best ever!"" ### Read More ### 2. ""I'd have a very good relationship with President Putin if we spend time together."" ### 3. ""I think that we would have a chance to have a very good relationship with Russia and a very good chance -- a very good relationship with President Putin."" ### 4. ""You know what? Putin's fine . He's fine. We're all fine."" ### 5. ""I think I could have a very good relationship with President Putin."" ### 6. ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing..."" ### 7. ""I believe that President Putin really feels, and he feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election."" ### 8. ""But I think Putin and I — President Putin and I would have a great relationship , and that would be great for both countries. ### 9. ""So you look at that, and you have President Putin very strongly , vehemently says he had nothing to do with that. Now, you're not going to get into an argument."" ### 10.  ""President Putin and I have been discussing various things and I think it's going very well. We've some very, very good talks. We're going to have a talk now and obviously that will continue. But we look forward to a lot of good, positive things happening for Russia, for the United States and for everybody concerned."" ### 11. ""Look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia , but then we're not going to make a deal."" ### So why is Trump so loath to say a negative word about Putin? Here are a few theories -- ranked from most to least favorable for Trump: ### He believes that geopolitical concerns -- Russia's role in dealing with North Korea, Syria etc. -- trump (ahem) everything else. Under that line of thinking, Trump sees Russia (and Putin) as a sort of necessary evil. He avoids calling out Putin as part of an effort to achieve the greater good. ### Trump is a deals guy. He knows that you can't make deals with someone if you can't get in a room with that person. And you can't get into a room with someone if all you do is badmouth him or her. ### Trump is drawn to strongmen with a tinge -- or more than a tinge -- of authoritarianism in their leadership style. There's a part of him that admires Putin's ability to command total fealty -- and not have to deal with an adversarial (aka independent) media. ### What's clear is that Trump isn't going to emerge from Monday's summit/meeting -- sum-meeting? -- with much to say about Putin that's negative. He hasn't done it in 18 months as President -- and two more years as a candidate -- and he ain't going to start on Monday in Helsinki. ### So don't hold your breath."

Both leaders made public remarks with translators before entering a private discussion. Trump repeatedly expressed optimism the talks would yield positive results. ### “I think we have great opportunities together as two countries that, frankly, have not been getting along very well for the last number of years,” Trump said, later adding, “I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship.” ### While Trump outlined several topics that he hoped the pair would discuss, he did not bring up Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. America’s intelligence agencies have all concluded Putin’s government conducted a hacking and social media campaign designed to boost Trump and hurt his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. On Friday, the Department of Justice announced indictments against 12 officers in Putin’s intelligence services and accused them of involvement in the campaign cyberattacks. Putin has denied Russia attempted to interfere in the U.S. election. ### Putin was about an hour late to the meeting. The pair stood next to each other for photos before sitting in adjacent chairs. They did not shake hands at the outset of their public remarks. ### The Russian president spoke first and his comments were far briefer than Trump’s. He declared, “The time has come to talk in a substantive way.” ### In the hours leading up to the meeting, Trump sent a pair of tweets criticizing the U.S. investigation into Russian interference in the election as a “Rigged Witch Hunt.” A team lead by special counsel Robert Mueller is conducting the investigation that filed the charges last week against the Russian intelligence officers. Mueller’s probe has also led to charges against multiple former members of Trump’s campaign, and investigators are looking into whether anyone on the president’s team worked with the Russians. ### President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands as they meet in Helsinki.

In his first tweet on Monday, Trump criticized his predecessor, President Barack Obama, for not doing more in 2016 to address initial reports of Russian interference. Trump also pointed to the involvement of Peter Strzok, an FBI agent who was found to have expressed anti-Trump sentiment in private during the election, as proof the probe is biased and “rigged” against him. ### “President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!” Trump wrote. ### Trump went on to claim the Mueller probe was part of a pattern of “stupidity” that hurt U.S. relations with Russia. ### “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” said Trump. ### Russia’s foreign ministry later took to Twitter to tout Trump’s message. “ We agree ,” it said. ### Sitting next to Putin in Helsinki, Trump started his remarks by congratulating the Russian president on the World Cup . This year, Russia hosted the quadrennial soccer tournament, which France won on Sunday. ### “First of all, Mr. President, I’d like to congratulate you on a really great World Cup, one of the best ever from what everybody tells me, one of the best ever. And also, for your team itself doing so well,” Trump said to Putin. ### President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin pose for a photograph at the beginning of a one-on-one meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki.

We have 90 percent of the nuclear [weapons], and that’s not a good thing. It’s a bad thing,” Trump said. “I think we hopefully can do something about that because it’s not a positive force. It’s a negative force. So, we’ll be talking about that among other things.” ### While Trump spoke, Putin slouched in his chair and watched his American counterpart with his head leaning on one hand. As Trump concluded his remarks, the pair turned towards each other and shook hands. ### “And with that, the world awaits and I look forward to our personal discussion, which I think begins now,” Trump said, adding, “We all have a lot of questions and hopefully we’ll come up with answers. Most importantly, it’s great to be with you.” ### Reporters were ushered out of the room after the pair of presidents made their opening remarks. Before they left, one reporter shouted a question about Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election. Trump and Putin did not respond, but according to the White House press pool, the Russian president “appeared to smirk” when he heard the question. ### Trump and Putin were originally scheduled to talk for an hour and a half, including time spent alone with their translators and meetings with staff. After those meetings, the American and Russian groups participated in a working lunch with both presidents. According to Russian officials, the meetings before the meal lasted two hours and ten minutes. The White House would not confirm this figure. As they sat down to eat, Trump responded to a reporter’s shouted question asking how he felt about the talks. ### “I think it’s a good start. Very, very good start for everybody,” Trump said. ### Trump and Putin are set to hold a joint press conference after their lunch. ### Read more from Yahoo News:"

8811,seattletimes.com,2018-07-15T06:42:25-04:00,"What Trump and Putin hope to achieve at Helsinki summit ### Originally published July 15, 2018 at 2:01 am ### Updated July 15, 2018 at 5:23 am ### Share story ### VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV ### The Associated Press ### HELSINKI (AP) — The outcome of the first summit between the unpredictable first-term American president and Russia’s steely-eyed longtime leader is anybody’s guess. With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday’s meeting in Helsinki, here’s a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### Most Read Nation & World Stories ### Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### “I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,” Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### “The fact that we’re having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,” said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. “What is important here is that we start a discussion.” ### Trump has been drawn to the spectacle of the summit and has expressed an eagerness to recreate in Helsinki the media show of last month’s Singapore summit when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Even as many NATO leaders made supportive noises this week, the Helsinki summit has raised fears in many global capitals that Trump will pull back from traditional Western alliances, allowing Putin to expand his sphere of influence. ### Back home, too, there is wariness on Capitol Hill, with a number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans urging Trump to cancel the summit in the wake of the explosive indictments. ### But Trump has vowed that he can handle Putin, whom he has taken to referring to as a “competitor” rather than an adversary. ### And Trump in recent days has outlined some of the items he’d like to discuss, including Ukraine. Though the president has said he was “not happy” about Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, he puts the blame on his predecessor and says he will continue relations with Putin even if Moscow refuses to return the peninsula. ### Trump also said he and Putin would discuss the ongoing war in Syria and arms control, negotiations that White House officials have signaled could be fruitful. ### “I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,” the president said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. “We’ve been modernizing and fixing and buying.  And it’s just a devastating technology.  And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it’s a very, very bad policy.” ### But it is the matter of election meddling, including fears Russia could try to interfere in the midterm elections this fall, that could play a central role in the summit talks or loom even larger if not addressed. In neither of Trump’s previous meetings with Putin — informal talks on the sidelines of summits last year in Germany and Vietnam — did the president publicly upbraid the Russian leader, prompting questions about whether he believed the former KGB officer’s denials over his own intelligence agencies’ assessments of meddling. ### Trump repeatedly has cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking of his Democratic rivals and disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a “witch hunt.” But he said in Britain that he would raise it with Putin even as he downplayed its impact. ### “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'” Trump said, invoking a television detective. “There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think.  But you never know what happens, right?  But I will absolutely firmly ask the question.” ### WHAT PUTIN WANTS ### For Putin, sitting down with Trump offers a long-awaited chance to begin repairing relations with Washington after years of spiraling tensions. ### Putin wants the U.S. and its allies to lift sanctions, pull back NATO forces deployed near Russia’s borders and restore business as usual with Moscow. In the longer run, he hopes to persuade the U.S. to acknowledge Moscow’s influence over its former Soviet neighbors and, more broadly, recognize Russia as a global player whose interests must be taken into account. ### These are long-term goals, and Putin realizes that no significant progress will come from just one meeting. More than anything else, he sees Monday’s summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### “Russia-U.S. ties aren’t just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. “It’s unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don’t meet.” ### Moscow views Trump’s criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump’s election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament’s upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won’t engage in vague talk about “illusory subjects,” such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia’s return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he’s likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be “pointless” to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea’s status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine’s push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### “Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,” Lukyanov said. “But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident.” ### ___"

Here’s what Trump can expect. ### Third, Putin — according to Putin — has never done anything wrong. In his view, current tensions in U.S.-Russian relations are all Obama’s fault, just like they were all the Bush administration’s fault before Obama took office. In his first meeting with Obama in Moscow in July 2009, Putin explained as much about the Bush administration (interestingly, he did not assign fault to Bush personally, but rather blamed those around him), going on for an entire hour without interruption to chronicle all of America’s mistakes up to then. So Putin will be waiting for concessions, rhetorical and substantive, from Trump to get our bilateral relationship on track. Putin, though, will never offer a real concession. He rarely even engages in negotiation. The idea floated by Trump recently that Putin might do him a favor and get out of Ukraine or Syria is laughable. Putin does no one any favors. Geopolitics for him is a zero-sum game. ### Fourth, Putin is a persuasive storyteller. In my view, his interpretations of historical events are incomplete, skewed and wrong. But if you don’t know the facts, his arguments can sound persuasive. In his meeting with Obama in June 2012 in Los Cabos, Mexico, Putin articulated a very forceful argument for why strongmen had to guide evolutionary modernization in the Middle East. He portrayed both Syria’s Bashar al-Assad and Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak as such leaders and berated us for giving up on Mubarak too soon. He made clear that he would not do the same to Assad, not because he had a strong personal relationship with the Syrian dictator but because there was no alternative. As I listened, I thought of dozens of flaws in his analysis. But if I didn’t know the history of the region or the academic literature on transitions from authoritarian rule, Putin would have sounded convincing. I worry about the lecture Putin might give to Trump about Arab culture or Crimean history. I’m not confident that Trump knows the details of these issues well enough to push back. ### Michael McFaul Posted at 10:20 pm on July 15, 2018 ### washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/07/15/ive-been-in-meetings-with-putin-heres-what-trump-can-expect/ ### Read More From Michael McFaul ### Trending on Townhall Media"

Undeterred, the American president was set to go face to face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### The summit was expected to start later than scheduled after Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour late in another display of the Russian's leader famous lack of punctuality. He's been late for past meetings with the pope and British Queen, among many others. ### Trump, who has sought to lower expectations about what will be achieved, told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."" ### In his tweets, Trump continued to undermine the investigation and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama , for failing to stop Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor. He claimed Obama ""was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it."" ### Trump and his top aides were downplaying expectations... ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin's primary mission was simply to have the summit happen. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one on one in the Finnish presidential palace's opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow's attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union , a bloc of nations that includes many of America's closest allies, as a ""foe."" ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump's jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over ""delinquent"" defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### "" NATO is now strong & rich!"" Trump wrote in a celebratory tweet Monday morning. During his breakfast, he said NATO had ""never been more together"" and said the summit had been ""a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love."" ### Ahead of his sit-down with with Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump has continued to unleash a series of attacks on the media, including as Air Force One descended into Helsinki. ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" Trump tweeted. ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!"" ### ""Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, ""not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime."" ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week — another chaotic stop on his European tour — that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said ""certainly I'll be asking about it"" although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can't force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a ""shameful comedy"" staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn't contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria's border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia's carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level. ### Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report."

My team and I carried out the reforms that created this environment, and we did it to reject the Soviet legacy of corruption, opacity, and nepotism—which still characterize the Russian system. During our conversations, I had the sense that Trump understood this reality. I hope and believe his clear-eyed understanding of Russia’s business environment bodes well for Monday’s summit. ### Second, while it is true that Putin tried to meddle in the U.S. elections and almost certainly favored Trump, it is also true that the Russian leader seriously miscalculated Trump’s motivations. Putin expected to get an American version of his old Italian friend Silvio Berlusconi, who could be easily corrupted and manipulated. Instead, Putin got a determined, nationalistic, and highly unpredictable U.S. president—who staffed his national security team with well-known Russia hawks and Putin critics, such as John Bolton, Fiona Hill, and Gen. James Mattis. ### Third, the Trump administration went beyond formal compliance with CAATSA in imposing historically harsh sanctions on Russian power brokers earlier this year. In my region, sanctioning government officials is not enough: Oligarchs and the authorities have always been inextricably linked. ### For the first time in the history of the U.S.-Russian bilateral relationship, the Trump administration acknowledged this nuance, by imposing sanctions on politically-connected oligarchs. These sanctions dismantled any pretense that oligarchs are legitimate business owners by treating them as they are—subsidiaries of the Russian government. ### I have several other reasons for optimism, including Trump’s criticism of the Nord Stream II pipeline deal at this week’s NATO summit and his authorization of lethal defensive weapons sales to Ukraine and Georgia last year—a dramatic reversal of Obama’s policy. ### In spite of these promising signs, however, I must caution Trump to avoid the mistakes his predecessors have made with regards to Putin’s Russia. ### After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, I sensed a widespread perception among Americans that the U.S. had “won” the Cold War. Since then, American policymakers have consistently underestimated Russia’s ambitions. Many opinion leaders and policymakers believed we had reached “the end of history,” where the liberal world order, predicated on self-determination, multilateralism, and territorial integrity, had triumphed for good over totalitarianism, imperialism, and bipolar spheres of influence. ### The Western misperception of the Russian threat—in tandem with Putin’s obsession with the “Western threat”—had devastating consequences for my region, including Putin’s invasions and annexations of Georgia and Ukraine. ### Unlike many of his Western counterparts, Putin does not bluff. He is honest about his ambitions. And why shouldn’t he be honest, when he does not have to pay the political price? Nevertheless, Western leaders often fail to listen. ### Unlike the American foreign policy agenda at times, the Russian agenda is clear and consistent. Putin will continue instigating and exploiting “frozen conflicts” in NATO-aspirant post-Soviet countries like Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, so that no independent state in his backyard will be welcomed into the Western alliance. Moreover, by promoting nationalistic, extremist, and corrupt politicians in the former Soviet space, Putin weakens Russia’s neighbors by amplifying social divisions. ### The Helsinki summit is arguably the biggest test of Trump's foreign policy acumen thus far, and he cannot afford to fail. ### As someone who has met with Vladimir Putin more than thirty times, has had to repeal his military attack and survived assassination threats from him, I have the following recommendations for President Trump: Be Reaganesque. Talk to the Russians, but start tough, and remember to “trust but verify” at each turn. ### Both Presidents Bush and Obama made the same mistake of trying to reset relations with Russia early in their presidencies. By hiding the sticks and producing too many carrots, Bush and Obama attempted to demonstrate good will—which Putin interpreted as weakness. The language of sheer force is what Putin understands best. ### President Trump should not lose sight of the fact that he doesn’t owe Putin anything: Indeed, Trump holds the upper hand. ### Despite Putin’s bravado, the sanctions are hurting him tremendously. And the very fact of the meeting legitimizes Putin in the eyes of Russian elite, who were getting nervous during the long delay in holding the summit. ### Now, it’s America’s turn to make demands. Russia should stop positioning itself as equal to the United States and stop pretending its foreign adventures, be they in Syria, Ukraine or Georgia, are part of a global fight against American expansionism. Moreover, Russia must stop threatening the U.S. with new weaponry, as Putin did during a recent address to the Russian Parliament. ### Furthermore, Trump must dash Putin’s hopes that the U.S. will ever accept Russia’s land grabs in the former Soviet space. In this respect, not only Ukraine should be mentioned, but also Georgia—where Russia occupies one-fifth of the NATO ally’s territory, in violation of a withdrawal agreement Moscow had previously signed. ### The bottom line should be that America will respect the borders of Russia if Russia starts to respect the borders of its neighbors. Unlike many in my region, I believe Trump should make a deal with Putin, with very specific terms: America will not undermine Putin’s regime inside Russia—Putin’s greatest fear—if Putin stops undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries. Only if Russia withdraws unconditionally from Ukraine and Georgia should the U.S. agree to discuss lifting sanctions. ###  ### Finally, Trump—and the rest of the world—would do well to manage expectations. A real deal cannot be made at the very first summit, as Reagan’s experience with Gorbachev demonstrated.  When Gorbachev tried to sell their first summit in Iceland as a success, Reagan bluntly contradicted his Soviet counterpart. Only with calculated skepticism in the beginning will the U.S. achieve victory in the end. ### Mikheil Saakashvili was the President of Georgia from 2004-2013 and led his country through the Russian-Georgian War of 2008. His perspective is shaped by his personal experience with Trump, Putin, and Russian interventionism as the head of state in a NATO-aspirant country partly occupied by Russia. ### Trending in Opinion"

As a Hennepin County public defender since 1984, I have spent my working life seeing the poverty's impact on families. ### We chose to cut funding for mental health programs and the mentally ill swept into our jails, workhouses, and prisons. Without treatment and housing facilities, these men increasingly came to the attention of police, who had now where else to bring them for help. We chose to cut funding for chemical health programs, and drug and alcohol abusers filled more beds. We chose to cut supports for education, and the jobless drifted into our system. Now the public has been assured that without the government's spending $700 billion, Wall Street will crash. Even without the bailout, I doubt I will see many Wall Street workers on my caseload. ### We have let the poor go without for 20 years, government just did not have the money. Now, amazingly-they do! Seven hundred billion dollars would build a lot of hospitals, clinics, and schools. ### Maybe the time has come to make bail for the poor, the helpless and the desperate. If we do spend the money on Wall Street, the money won't just come from the taxpayer, it will also come from the mouths of the children dependent on WIC, the hand of the unemployed in line at the Labor Department and the wounded warriors at the VA. We should be ashamed of ourselves. ### JOHN MAHONEY, EXCELSIOR ### Parachutes for principals ### With all the focus on CEO and teacher compensation in the news lately, and people arguing to hold schools accountable for results just like in the business world, maybe the taxpayers can provide huge golden parachutes to superintendents, principals and educators who preside over severe achievement decline so they can also retire in style. ### DAVID ANDERSON, MINNEAPOLIS ### Debating the Friday night debate ### Sen. John McCain couldn't decide -- the day before -- whether or not to participate in Friday night's debate. So why should the American people think that he can decide about really important things like what to do about the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression? ### The more I see, the more the ""maverick"" moniker that the senator fancies is really a combination of indecision and rashness. Hardly the qualities one wants in a president. ### LOUIS HOFFMAN, MINNEAPOLIS ### ••• ### During the first presidential debate, one aspect became very clear: Barack Obama spoke of things he has been told about, whereas John McCain spoke of these same things and others that he knew about from experience. ### DARREL SALCHERT, CHAMPLIN ### ••• ### Reading about, and seeing, Sen. John McCain's refusal to look at Sen. Barack Obama during the Friday debate, my memory was tossed back to my young days in Milwaukee. ### When I helped my grandmother shop downtown, we would take the 13th Street bus. She always told me not to look at ""colored"" people (the word of the time) in the eyes. To my ""why,"" I never got an answer. ### MICHAEL ALLEN MIKOLAJCZAK, MINNEAPOLIS ### ••• ### Minnesota, along with all the surrounding states, is a farm state where the largest crop grown is corn. Why hasn't the Star Tribune picked up on the point in Friday night's debate that John McCain will stop corn ethanol subsidies? ### ROBERT FOLSOM, NEW BRIGHTON ### Election Day's closing in, and it's time for candidates to go positive ### On reading Lori Sturdevant's Sept. 21 column about the book ""Riding into the Sunrise: Al Quie, a Life of Faith and Civility,"" I note Quie's advice to his successors to remember "" . . . The state has a responsibility to carry out the work society has given it."" Now this was advice to the new governor and the legislators to arrive at a positive solution which required both trust and working together. ### In this present environment this is an even more difficult position for all. However, our state and our nation's survival require such ""working together"" with trust. ### Also noteworthy was the former governor's statement ""When your child is seriously ill, you throw away the family budget and spend whatever you need to spend to save your child."" This from a truly conservative Republican, one who when elected ran into an economic downturn almost immediately. ### I am often troubled by how many people feel any government is bad and any amount of taxes is too much. There are infrastructure needs of any community (bridges, highways, police and firefighters and the list can go on -- legitimately). ### I am not suggesting simply spend whatever for the present situation, nor am I suggesting Gov. Tim Pawlenty's becoming a ""lame duck,"" nor am I arguing for who the next president must be. However, I am urging all to remember we do need to come to a solution, hopefully, without so many extreme words and deep divisions. ### I urge all elected officials to remember why they first ran for public office. To serve responsibly and make the state and the nation a better place. ### I worked with many legislators of both parties during my work life. I found they did come to public office sincerely to serve. The deep divisions came with the power of the special interest groups. I am hopeful elected officials can put aside the incredible negativity which is so prevalent and begin to discuss realistic solutions within the framework of doing the best for the greater good. ### With the coming election this will be much more difficult. Bit would it not be wonderful if all campaigns could begin to air only the ads describing the positive reasons we should vote for that candidate. Would it not also be wonderful if we would all argue our candidate's strong points and why we think that candidate should be elected? ### We are all Americans and this is a time for all of us to look at the others with respect and tolerance to their views even when we strongly disagree. I pray for and urge all candidates to ""turn positive"" and work for the best for our community. Please! ### DOTTIE RIETOW, GOLDEN VALLEY"

RAND PAUL ### Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ### President Trump meets with Russian President Putin today, days after meeting with our NATO allies in Europe. Both meetings are important, and both cause confusion among politicians and those who report on them back home. ### Foreign policy is difficult. It comes in many shades of gray, and those who treat it like a team sport do harm to our safety and to our politics. ### Story Continued Below ### Politicizing international affairs is a dangerous game, but that hasn’t stopped far too many in Washington, who seem to have forgotten that a vital part of keeping America safe and secure is avoiding war through strong and consistent diplomacy, from playing politics. One way they do this is to insist we not meet with or speak openly to our adversaries on the world stage. ### I disagree. Dialogue is especially important when hundreds of millions of lives are at stake, as is the case in relations between the United States and nuclear-armed Russia. So I applaud President Trump for both chiding our NATO allies and greeting its expansion with skepticism, and I applaud him for sitting down with President Putin. We should be doing more of this self-examination and dialogue. ### Throughout history, including during the height of the Cold War, both sides maintained constant dialogue and communications. Even during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we had diplomatic relations and constant communications. ### Unfortunately, over the last two years, some have fueled a hysteria that has created such a paralysis regarding Russia that regular meetings and communications have ceased, and one can be accused of “collusion” merely for agreeing to a routine meeting with elected Russian officials who might be visiting Capitol Hill. ### The hostile climate created by Russophobes has resulted in a vacuum in cultural, educational and even legislative exchanges, while elected officials from both Washington and Moscow are now on so-called “ban lists.” Nothing will be achieved through each country shutting the door to the other. ### We must find a way to keep our historic allies, while realizing that threatening Russia through NATO expansion is not the answer. As Georgetown Professor Charles Kupchan stated , “From Moscow’s perspective, NATO has ignored [Russia’s] vociferous objections and expanded … bringing the world’s most formidable military alliance up to Russia’s borders. … Moscow perceives a threat … helping fuel the confrontational turn in the Kremlin’s foreign policy and renewed rivalry with the West.” ### Of course, we don’t have to make decision based on whether they will or will not make Russia mad. But we should at the very least recognize the impact of our actions before we take them. There seems to be a lack of thought and rush to action among some critics of the president’s meeting with Putin. ### Russia doesn’t need to be considered our friend. But we certainly have overlapping interests – Syria, Islamic terrorism and energy – that require us to have an open dialogue and relationship. ### I am thankful that President Trump is once again willing to go against the political elite in Washington and keep the lines of communication to Moscow open. ### In just a few weeks, I will take my own trip to Russia in an attempt to discuss common ground with their leaders and help prevent further, unnecessary escalation of tensions. We will discuss trade, cultural exchanges and how to better work for peace and prosperity in the world. I look forward to consulting with President Trump in between his visit and mine and to working with diplomats from both countries to have a successful trip and better relationships. Millions of lives could be at stake."

John McCain said Friday that President Donald Trump must be willing to confront Vladimir Putin on election hacking during  their summit on Monday. ### McCain said if he isn't prepared to hold the Russian president accountable, the summit should not take place. ### His statement comes after the Justice Department announced charges  against 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking into Democratic accounts during the  2016 presidential election. ### The indictment stands as special counsel Robert Mueller's first allegation implicating the Russian government directly in criminal behavior meant to sway the presidential election. ### McCain says the revelations from the Justice Department add to a body of evidence that confirms a Russian plot to ""attack the 2016 election, sow chaos and dissention among the American electorate, and undermine faith in our democracy."" ### Many Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have called for the summit to be canceled. ### The Kremlin has denied that the Russian state interfered in the U.S. election. ### The White House stressed that the new indictments contain no allegations of knowing involvement by anyone on the Trump campaign or that the hacking the Russians are accused of conducting affected the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. ### They said that the summit will go on as planned. ### So, if they do move forward with the summit, should Trump bring up the Russian hacking with President Putin? ### Vote in our informal and unscientific poll and tell us why in the comments. ###  ### Bookmark  NJ.com/Opinion . Follow on Twitter  @NJ_Opinion  and find NJ.com  Opinion on Facebook . ### View Comments"

Russian women who have dated the soccer fans have been shamed by some Russian commentators, denounced for allegedly undermining the country's morals and gene pool. The widespread, vehement criticism has shown the dominance of patriarchal and sexist views in Russia, where the concept of gender equality is a generation behind that of the West's.

Endless media hype. Huge ratings. ### Although President Donald Trump has met with Russia's Vladimir Putin twice before, he is eager to recreate in Finland the heady experience that he had last month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore: a summit that became a mass media event complete with powerful presidential images. Ever the showman and insistent on establishing closer ties to Moscow, Trump overruled his advisers and demanded the rituals and pageantry of a formal summit. ### Trump had boasted to confidants about the number of cameras in Singapore, claiming it dwarfed coverage of the Oscars, according to a person familiar with his thinking but not authorized to discuss private conversations and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Though Trump originally expressed concern that Helsinki was not glamorous enough and favored hosting Putin at the White House, the president was reassured by aides that it would be an effective backdrop. And long believing in the power of personal connections, he has insisted to aides that it was essential to sit down with Putin to establish a rapport. ### SIGN UP ### Be the first to know. ### No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. ### SIGN ME UP! ### ""He's been very nice to me the times I've met him. I've been nice to him. He's a competitor,"" Trump said of Putin last week in Brussels. ""You know, somebody was saying, 'Is he an enemy?' No, he's not my enemy. 'Is he a friend?' No, I don't know him well enough."" ### Drawing on his experience as a marketer and salesman, Trump has long been convinced that his mastery of powerful images has been essential to his political rise. The president has told advisers that the Singapore diplomacy made him look like a take-charge president. And it was not lost on him that his poll numbers received a temporary bump after the meeting. ### ___ ### What Trump and Putin hope to achieve at Helsinki summit ### HELSINKI (AP) — The outcome of the first summit between the unpredictable first-term American president and Russia's steely-eyed longtime leader is anybody's guess. With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ___ ### Young Nubians revive dream of returning to land in Egypt ### ASWAN, Egypt (AP) — The world of their parents and grandparents was turned upside down more than 50 years ago when they were evacuated from villages along the Nile River to make way for the High Dam. Now a younger generation has revived the long-dormant cause of Egypt's Nubians, campaigning for a return to their lands and struggling to preserve their culture. ### Their timing could not have been worse. ### Recent peaceful marches by Nubians were met by swift suppression from the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, which has shown little tolerance for dissent. To a state dominated by the military and security agencies, Nubians' assertion of their distinct identity and heritage amid the Arab majority looks like a threat to stability. ### ""This country has so many colors and ethnicities, and it is so destructive that we are trying to give it just one identity,"" said Fatmah Imam, a Nubian activist born and raised in Cairo. Even during her days at university, she recalled, the message instilled was that the country should be homogeneous. ### ""It is painful for me that I am unable to manifest my identity,"" she said. ""I see Egypt as a mosaic."" ### ___ ### S. Korea probes army plan for troops to control protesters ### SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A group of army generals rolling tanks and troops into Seoul to seize power. Paratroopers firing at large crowds calling for democracy. Tanks and armored vehicles stationed at universities to intimidate student protesters. ### Such scenes of military intervention in South Korea have been nonexistent since the country achieved democracy in the late 1980s. But revelations this past week of a document showing the military drafted plans to mobilize troops to suppress protests last year have struck a nerve among people in one of Asia's most vibrant and wealthiest democracies. Some allege the plans even included a scenario for a coup. ### The memories of brutal, military-backed dictatorships that imprisoned, tortured and executed dissidents remain vivid to many South Koreans. But most experts say the actual chances for another coup in South Korea are extremely low. A look at the explosive revelations and why a coup is nearly impossible to pull off today: ### ___ ### ___ ### US judge criticizes plan to reunify families split at border ### SAN DIEGO (AP) — A federal judge, responding to a plan to reunify children separated at the border, said he was having second thoughts about his belief that the Trump administration was acting in good faith to comply with his orders. ### The Justice Department on Friday filed a plan to reunify more than 2,500 children age 5 and older by a court-imposed deadline of July 26 using ""truncated"" procedures to verify parentage and perform background checks, which exclude DNA testing and other steps it took to reunify children under 5. ### The administration said the abbreviated vetting puts children at significant safety risk but is needed to meet the deadline. ### Chris Meekins, deputy assistant Health and Human Services secretary for preparedness and response, filed a declaration that he is fully committed to meeting the deadline. However, he does not believe ""the placing of children into such situations is consistent with the mission of HHS or my core values."" ### U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw took umbrage at Meekins' statement, disputing the official's interpretation of his orders and saying that safe reunification could and will occur by July 26. ### ___ ### Trump's remarks about changing European culture draw ire ### WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's lament this week that immigration is ""changing the culture"" of Europe echoed rising anti-immigrant feelings on both sides of the Atlantic, where Europe and the United States are going through a demographic transformation that makes some of the white majority uncomfortable. ### Historians and advocates immediately denounced Trump's comments, saying such talk would encourage white nationalists. ### ""The way he put this argument about changing our culture ... about Europe becoming less nice than it is, in other words, these people are here and they are making the culture crappy and making the place lesser, that's straight out of the white supremacist/white nationalist playbook,"" said Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project. ### Trump, in an interview with the British newspaper The Sun, blamed immigration for a changing culture in Europe: ""I think allowing millions and millions of people to come into Europe is very, very sad. I think you are losing your culture. Look around. You go through certain areas that didn't exist ten or 15 years ago."" ### Trump, the grandson of a German immigrant and the son of a Scottish immigrant to the United States, repeated his contention at a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May: ### ___ ### US official: Russia using social media to divide Americans ### PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The U.S. homeland security secretary said on Saturday there are no signs that Russia is targeting this year's midterm elections with the same ""scale or scope"" it targeted the 2016 presidential election. ### Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen spoke at a convention of state secretaries of state, an event that's usually a low-key affair highlighting voter registration, balloting devices and election security issues that don't get much public attention. But coming amid fresh allegations into Russia's attempts to sway the 2016 election, the sessions on election security have a higher level of urgency and interest. ### Nielsen said her agency will help state and local election officials prepare their systems for cyberattacks from Russia or elsewhere. She said U.S. intelligence officials are seeing ""persistent Russian efforts using social media, sympathetic spokespeople and other fronts to sow discord and divisiveness amongst the American people, though not necessarily focused on specific politicians or political campaigns."" ### The conference of top state election officials she addressed was sandwiched between Friday's indictments of 12 Russian military intelligence officers alleged to have hacked into Democratic party and campaign accounts and Monday's long-awaited meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### Trump has never condemned Russia over meddling in the 2016 election despite the findings of all top U.S. intelligence agencies, and the Kremlin has insisted it didn't meddle in the U.S. election. In the past, Trump has reiterated Putin's denials, but this week he said he would bring up the issue when they meet on Monday in Finland. ### ___ ### Angry crowd protests after Chicago police fatally shoot man ### CHICAGO (AP) — An angry crowd shouted and threw bottles at Chicago police after an officer fatally shot a man on the city's South Side Saturday, prompting the arrest of at least four demonstrators. ### Chicago police patrol chief Fred Waller told a news conference that the man was shot in the South Shore neighborhood after police officers on foot tried to question him because ""the bulge around his waistband"" suggested he was armed. The man became combative and eventually broke free from the officers, Waller said. ### ""They thought he appeared to be reaching for a weapon, which he did have a weapon on him, and the officers tragically shot him,"" he said. ### The unidentified man was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Waller said police believe the man did not have a concealed carry permit for the semi-automatic weapon. He also had magazines of ammunition, Waller said. ### Immediately after the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and began jostling with police, who had cordoned off the area. Waller said protesters threw bottles and jumped on top of a squad car. Police then moved in wielding batons to stop them. ### ___ ### Russian women push back at shaming over World Cup dating ### MOSCOW (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of foreign men have flooded into Russia for the monthlong World Cup, setting off a fierce debate in the host nation about the roles and rights of women. ### Russian women who have dated the soccer fans have been shamed by some Russian commentators, denounced for allegedly undermining the country's morals and gene pool. ### The widespread, vehement criticism has shown the dominance of patriarchal and sexist views in Russia, where the concept of gender equality is a generation behind that of the West's. ### Still, the reaction against Russian women's World Cup dalliances has been so strong that some feminists in Russia think it could actually advance their cause by shocking even conservative women who wouldn't identify themselves as feminists. ### ""Even those women (are saying) 'Enough is enough, you've gone too far!"" feminist writer Snezhana Gribatskaya said. ### ___ ### Haiti's prime minister resigns amid fuel price hike fallout ### PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Haitian Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant resigned Saturday amid calls for him to step down over his handling of a failed plan to raise fuel prices that set off a wave of deadly protests. ### Lafontant told Haiti's Chamber of Deputies that he sent President Jovenel Moise his resignation letter. Moise confirmed via Twitter that he had accepted Lafontant's resignation along with those of other Cabinet members. ### The prime minister's abrupt resignation came ahead of a vote on a motion of censure Lafontant, a first step toward asking that Moise name a new prime minister to form a Cabinet to handle the crisis. The prime minister is the second highest official in Haiti after the president. ### Lafontant was to answer questions about the July 6-8 riots that followed the government's attempt to raise fuel prices by up to 51 percent as part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. At least seven people were killed and dozens of businesses were looted during the unrest. ### Instead, Lafontant (LA-FAH-TON) used the opportunity to announce his resignation, while in various parts of Haiti's small protests were held demanding the head of state step down."

News that paid employees of the Russian government—military intelligence officers, no less—interfered and sought to influence the 2016 presidential election, coming just days before the victor of that election will meet Russian president Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, amounts to nothing less than an international geopolitical bombshell. The new charges, which come in an 11-count, 29-page indictment, lays out Russia's alleged efforts in the excruciating detail and specificity that has become the Mueller investigative team's hallmark."

But in advance of the talks, Trump listed a series of topics that did not include Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. ### “We have not been getting along well for the last number of years,” Trump said after arriving at the Presidential Palace in Finland’s capital, where the leaders are meeting. “But I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship. … I really think the world wants to see us get along.” ### Putin, for his part, said he and Trump have maintained regular contact through phone calls and meetings at international events but “the time has come to have a thorough discussion on various international problems and sensitive issues.” He added: “There are quite a few of them for us to pay attention to.” ### Most Read Nation & World Stories ### Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. ### Their opening one-on-one session had been scheduled to run 90 minutes. The Russians said it lasted two hours and 10 minutes. The White House wouldn’t immediately confirm the timing. ### The summit, which is being closely watched around the world, was not the first time Trump and Putin have held talks. They met on the sidelines of world leader meetings in Germany and Vietnam last year. But Monday’s session was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump’s presidential campaign. ### Trump said last week that he would raise the meddling issue again with Putin, but questions have been swirling about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the interference that prompted a special investigation probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a “witch hunt.” ### Addressing reporters before the one-on-one meeting, Putin struck a casual pose during Trump’s remarks, slouching in his chair with his legs wide and eyes low. He nodded along to some of Trump’s remarks before they were translated, showcasing his fluency in English. Trump leaned forward in his chair, his hands tented in front of him and frequently glanced over at the Russian president. At one point, he shot Putin a wink. After Trump concluded his remarks, American reporters shouted several questions about whether he would bring up election meddling during his discussions with Putin. ### Trump did not respond; Putin appeared to smirk. ### With that, the leaders gave a quick handshake and their private meeting in the opulent Gothic Hall was under way. Just the two of them, each with a translator. ### They continued the discussion with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor’s throne room. They’ll conclude the summit by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Out on the streets, the summit attracted a grab-bag of protesters, with abortion-rights activists wearing artificially bulging bellies and Trump masks, anti-fascist protesters bearing signs with expletive-laden insults, and free traders, anti-war Ukrainians and gay rights supporters making their voices heard. ### The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States — and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea — for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow’s aggression may go unchallenged. ### “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,” Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming “many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” ### The Russian foreign ministry responded by liking Trump’s tweet and then replying: “We agree.” ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian’s leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British queen, among many others. ### Several dozen Trump supporters, many waving American flags and sporting “Make America Great Again” caps, cheered Trump near his waterfront hotel in Helsinki. Two held up a handwritten banner that read “God Bless D & M Trump.” ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn’t “expect anything” from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn’t looking for any “concrete deliverables.” Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland’s president that he thought the summit would go “fine.” ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders met alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. Not mentioned: Election meddling or Syria. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week’s indictment as part of a “shameful comedy” they claim has been staged to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties. ### In tweets Monday, Trump continued to undermine the investigation and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia’s efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump’s favor. He claimed Obama “was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it.” ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea or the easing of crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow’s attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria’s border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia’s carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### ___ ### Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Ken Thomas and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report. ### ___ ### Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Colvin at http://twitter.com/@colvinj and Isachenkov at http://twitter.com/@visachenkov ### JONATHAN LEMIRE"

The initial meeting was cordial but tense. ### “We have a lot of good things to talk about and things to talk about. We have discussions on everything from trade to military to missiles to nuclear,” Trump said during a joint press conference with his Russian counterpart shortly after their initial greeting. ### “I think we have great opportunities together as two countries that frankly, we have not been getting along very well for the last number of years,” he added. “I’ve been here not too long, but it’s getting close to two years, but I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship.” ### WATCH: ### The president, as his critics were quick to note, did not mention election meddling in his list of topics for discussion, but this issue may be brought up at a later point in the summit, as Trump has said as much. He stressed  during the press conference the need for improved relations with Russia. “Getting along with Russia is a good thing,” he explained. ### His comments follow a historically inaccurate tweet that suggests that deteriorating U.S.-Russian relations are tied to the ongoing Russia investigation, what the president calls a “witch hunt.” The investigation has yet to produce any solid evidence that Russia influenced the outcome of the presidential election or that the president colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. ### Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt! ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018 ### Speaking at the brief press conference, Putin said that rising global tensions made talks between himself and Trump a necessity. “The time has come to talk thoroughly about our bilateral relations, as well as various hotspots in the world,” the Russian president explained with the assistance of a translator. “There are enough of them for us to start paying attention.” ### While Trump and Putin meet in private and expanded sessions with advisers, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will sit down with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. ### The president said in an interview over the weekend that he is going into the summit with “low expectations.” In a series of tweets, Trump said that he will be criticized regardless of what he accomplishes.

Glasser ### 7:37 A.M. ### Trump’s tweet seemed to confirm the worst fears of those who worried that the President came to Helsinki determined to make friends with Putin. ### Photograph by Xander Heinl / Photothek / Getty ### President Donald Trump has set the stage for this historic meeting, the first formal session between U.S. and Russian leaders since Putin’s illegal annexation of Crimea, in 2014, in an extraordinary way, tweeting this morning, “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” The President’s decision to blame hostile relations between the two Cold War adversaries on his own country was quickly noted by the Russian side, and the tweet was even liked by the official account of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Blame America First,” tweeted a piqued former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, in response. No matter what else it accomplishes, this meeting in Helsinki will undoubtedly count as the first such session in which Kremlinology has morphed into Twitterology for the thousands of journalists gathered here to interpret the proceedings based on the sparse information that has been officially handed out. ### Trump’s tweet ignored history and facts on so many levels, and seemed to confirm the worst fears of those in many parties who worried that the American President came to Helsinki determined to make friends with Putin, rather than hold him to account for actions that range from the Russian incursion into Ukraine to election meddling in the United States. They didn’t even need to speculate about Trump’s intentions: he openly broadcast them in the days leading up to the meeting, in a series of statements to the press in which he mused about the positive “relationship” he hoped to build with Putin, while excoriating allies and blasting the European Union as a “foe” of the United States. ### As for the agenda, it remains a mystery, with none of the standard “deliverables” in place that would normally be negotiated well in advance of such a meeting. Speculative reports have emerged that Trump and his advisers have been debating whether to pursue an agreement with Putin on Syria that would presumably involve a reduced American presence in the country in exchange for a Russian commitment to pressure Iran to reduce its military presence there. But then again, no one really knows, and that’s the point for this American President: all eyes must remain on him, or at least his Twitter account. ### Susan B.  ### Sign up for our daily newsletter and get the best of The New Yorker in your in-box. ### Go"

But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow’s attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America’s closest allies, as a ‘‘foe.’’ ### ‘‘I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,’’ Trump said. ### Advertisement ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump’s jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over ‘‘delinquent’’ defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### And on the eve of his meeting with Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump unleashed a series of attacks on the media as Air Force One descended into Helsinki, complaining that Democrats and the press were unlikely to give him credit for any summit accomplishments. ### ‘‘Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!’’ Trump tweeted. ‘‘Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!’’ ### In his next tweet, he congratulated Putin on hosting ‘‘one of the best ever’’ World Cup tournaments. ### ‘‘Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,’’ said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center’s Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, ‘‘not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime.’’ ### Advertisement ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week — another chaotic stop on his European tour — that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ‘‘I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,’’’ said Trump, invoking a television detective. ‘‘There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question.’’ ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said ‘‘certainly I’ll be asking about it’’ although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn’t have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can’t force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia’s constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week’s indictment as part of a ‘‘shameful comedy’’ staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn’t contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria’s border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia’s carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level. ### "

Senator Rand Paul on 2016 Election Meddling: “All Countries That Can Spy…Do” ### Sunday, July 15, 2018 10:33 ### % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents. ### On Sunday morning, Senator Rand Paul was a guest on the CNN show State of the Union with Jake Tapper. Among other things, the two discussed NATO and Russian interference in our 2016 presidential election. ### When it came to maintaining the integrity of U.S. elections, Senator Paul mentioned some ways he’s advocated for strengthening the process: decentralization down to the precinct level and storing data in a safe place, including a backup. ### He then gave an answer that absolutely shocked the host. ### SENATOR PAUL: “It’s tricky. Can we restrict the Russians? We might be able to in some ways, but I think in the bottom line we’ve wanted the Russians to admit it.  They’re not going to admit it the same way we’re not going to admit that we were involved in the Ukranian elections or in the Russians elections. So all countries that can spy, do. All countries that want to interfere in elections…and have the ability to do, they try.” ### TAPPER: “It sounds as though you are saying that the United States has done the equivalent of what the Russians did in the 2016 election, and it might sound to some viewers that you are offering that, uh, statement as an excuse for what the Russians did? ### SENATOR PAUL: “No, what I would say is it’s not morally equivalent but I think in their mind it is. And I think it’s important to know in your adversary’s mind the way they perceive things. I do think that they react to our interference in both their elections…One of the reasons they really didn’t like Hillary Clinton is they found her responsible for some of the activity by the U.S. in their elections under the Obama administration…” ### “I’m not saying they’re equivalent – or morally equivalent – but I am saying that this is the way the Russians respond.” ### The interview went on from there. ### Though the senator himself stated that election interference by the U.S. is not in any way equivalent to what was done by Russia in 2016, damage has been done. ### It’s an extremely dangerous thing to place us on the same level as Russia and unfortunately, by saying “we all do it” Senator Paul has done that. Stop being an apologist. ### There’s a tendency for individuals on the Right to say that because there’s no proof of actual collusion between the Trump administration and the Russians, then election meddling shouldn’t isn’t that serious or worse, should be shrugged off. This is a huge, partisan error. We absolutely should be bothered by election interference, even if, as Senator Paul implies, it’s expected from countries that are capable of it. We should seek to safeguard the process, whether our candidate is victorious in the end or not. ### If Senator Rand Paul was looking to smooth things over on Sunday morning, he did the exact opposite. ### By not taking a hard stance on the hot-button issue of election meddling, he’s made a mess for himself and has given the president and his administration another lousy talking point.  Follow her on  Twitter  and  Facebook ."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. ### SUBSCRIBE ### HELSINKI — The whole world is watching now. ### As President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin sit down for their first summit here today— one 90-minute meeting with no one else in the room followed by one featuring the two leaders and top aides — the unresolved issues involving the two sides range from nuclear nonproliferation to the balance of power in Europe and election-meddling. ### The public glimpse into their talks will come at a joint press conference set for 9:50 a.m. ET. ### But there is no real set agenda for the hastily arranged power chats, which were announced less than three weeks ago and for which Trump has declined to elaborate on any goals beyond simply meeting with Putin and raising the issues at hand. ### Trump said little about his meeting with Putin when asked about his goals during a breakfast Monday with Finnish officials. ### ""We’ll see him a little while,"" Trump said. ""We’ll do just fine."" ### With any deal-making to be done on the fly, some American experts on Russia are deeply concerned that gives Putin, who has been in power in Moscow for the last 18 years, the upper hand over Trump. ### ""He knows the details of these issues way better than Trump, or indeed almost any other head of state in the world,"" Michael McFaul, who served as President Barack Obama's ambassador to Moscow, wrote in the Washington Post . ""That’s why the extended one-on-one meeting with Trump planned for the summit gives Putin a huge advantage."" ### Trump says he will 'absolutely' bring up election meddling with Putin ### Jul.13.201802:19 ### On two of the most pressing matters, Russia's cyber attacks against the U.S. and Putin's incursions into Ukraine, Trump has signaled repeatedly that he is not nearly as worried about them as officials in his own administration, Democrats and Republicans in Congress, and much of the American public are. ### ""I will absolutely bring up meddling,"" Trump said at a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May last week. But, knowing at the time that his Justice Department was about to announce indictments against a dozen Russian spies for cyber attacks against Democrats during the 2016 campaign, he referred to the investigation into his campaign's ties to Moscow as a ""rigged witch hunt."" ### While U.S. officials say they will maintain sanctions against Russia for seizing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, Trump himself hasn't ruled out recognizing that annexation of territory that Putin believes is rightfully his. ### ""We’re going to have to see,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One late last month. ### Anna-Liisa Heusala, a Russian Studies professor at the University of Helsinki, said Putin wants ""actual recognition or de facto acceptance"" of his military action in Ukraine, Syria and other regional hotspots and affirmation of his view of Russia as a ""superpower, above international norms and law."" ### ""From Russia’s perspective, its actions in Ukraine and the Crimea, which it partially justified with humanitarian causes, were a demonstration of its strengthened role and ability to set boundaries for the actions of other parties when these are deemed to seriously threaten Russian national interests,"" she said. ""As Russia categorically opposes the expansion of NATO near its border, it interprets that the annexing of the Crimea was also a defensive action due to the military importance of the area."" ### Related ### As Trump meets Putin, will the king of the deal finally make one? ### Some veteran American foreign policy hands say that it is worthwhile for the U.S. to re-engage with Russia after years of deterioration in the relationship, several failed attempts to jump-start it and the resumption of an arms race between the two countries . ### But there is also fear, amid the Russia investigation that has dogged Trump at home and boiling tension over NATO's eastward expansion and Putin's push to influence his western neighbors, that the one-on-one meeting could end up harming U.S. interests. ### ""I’m shaking my head so violently I have whiplash,"" said Ellen Tauscher, who was undersecretary of State for arms control and international security during most of Obama's first term. ### Breaking News Emails"

The arguments feed the Kremlin narrative that democracy is dangerous unless it is carefully “managed.” ### Russian commentators and editorialists who consider the European Union hostile, troublesome or irrelevant welcomed Trump’s criticism of longtime European allies as “foes” to the U.S. ### Russia’s state-run Channel One said Trump’s meetings in Britain and contentious appearance at the NATO summit last week were secondary to Monday’s summit, saying: “After all, he was just passing through Brussels and London on the way to Helsinki.” ### Konstantin Kosachev, head of the upper house of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, wrote in Izvestia that Monday’s talks come at a time when “so-called ‘peace-loving’ Europe is afraid of peace talks between U.S. and Russia.” ### Russian media did have rather tempered expectations of how much Putin can concretely get from the summit, but hoped for progress on solutions for Syria and Mideast tensions. ### Heading into the summit, Trump denounced the American news media as the “enemy of the people,” despite constitutional protections for freedom of the press. ### The Russian media scene is a different beast. Under Putin, the government has assumed control or sway over most broadcasters and mainstream media and put pressure on critical reporting online. Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some outspoken Russian journalists. ### A protest sign for the summit posted on a Helsinki bus stop Monday read “Unpleasant things will happen to Journalists who ask Putin questions.” ### Despite clear interest in Russia in Putin’s meeting with Trump, the summit wasn’t the No. 1 item on many Russian newscasts or websites Monday: That honor went to the World Cup, and Russia’s own global image."

Here I examine the credibility of this story. Next week I shall look at alternative explanations. ### Russia has a decade long secret programme of producing and stockpiling novichok nerve agents. It also has been training agents in secret assassination techniques, and British intelligence has a copy of the Russian training manual, which includes instruction on painting nerve agent on doorknobs. ### The only backing for this statement by Boris Johnson is alleged “intelligence”, and unfortunately the “intelligence” about Russia’s secret novichok programme comes from exactly the same people who brought you the intelligence about Saddam Hussein’s WMD programme, proven liars. Furthermore, the question arises why Britain has been sitting on this intelligence for a decade and doing nothing about it, including not telling the OPCW inspectors who certified Russia’s chemical weapons stocks as dismantled. ### If Russia really has a professional novichok assassin training programme, why was the assassination so badly botched? Surely in a decade of development they would have discovered that the alleged method of gel on doorknob did not work? And where is the training manual which Boris Johnson claimed to possess? Having told the world – including Russia -the UK has it, what is stopping the UK from producing it, with marks that could identify the specific copy erased? ### The Russians chose to use this assassination programme to target Sergei Skripal, a double agent who had been released from jail in Russia some eight years previously. ### It seems remarkable that the chosen target of an attempt that would blow the existence of a secret weapon and end the cover of a decade long programme, should be nobody more prominent than a middle ranking double agent who the Russians let out of jail years ago. If they wanted him dead they could have killed him then. Furthermore the attack on him would undermine all future possible spy swaps. Putin therefore, on this reading, was willing to sacrifice both the secrecy of the novichok programme and the spy swap card just to attack Sergei Skripal. That seems highly improbable. ### Only the Russians can make novichok and only the Russians had a motive to attack the Skripals. ### The nub of the British government’s approach has been the shocking willingness of the corporate and state media to parrot repeatedly the lie that the nerve agent was Russian made, even after Porton Down said they could not tell where it was made and the OPCW confirmed that finding. In fact, while the Soviet Union did develop the “novichok” class of nerve agents, the programme involved scientists from all over the Soviet Union, especially Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia, as I myself learnt when I visited the newly decommissioned Nukus testing facility in Uzbekistan in 2002. ### Furthermore, it was the USA who decommissioned the facility and removed equipment back to the United States. At least two key scientists from the programme moved to the United States. Formulae for several novichok have been published for over a decade. The USA, UK and Iran have definitely synthesised a number of novichok formulae and almost certainly others have done so too. Dozens of states have the ability to produce novichok, as do many sophisticated non-state actors. ### As for motive, the Russian motive might be revenge, but whether that really outweighs the international opprobrium incurred just ahead of the World Cup, in which so much prestige has been invested, is unclear. ### What is certainly untrue is that only Russia has a motive. The obvious motive is to attempt to blame and discredit Russia. Those who might wish to do this include Ukraine and Georgia, with both of which Russia is in territorial dispute, and those states and jihadist groups with which Russia is in conflict in Syria. The NATO military industrial complex also obviously has a plain motive for fueling tension with Russia. ### There is of course the possibility that Skripal was attacked by a private gangster interest with which he was in conflict, or that the attack was linked to Skripal’s MI6 handler Pablo Miller’s work on the Orbis/Steele Russiagate dossier on Donald Trump. ### Plainly, the British governments statements that only Russia had the means and only Russia had the motive, are massive lies on both counts. ### The Russians had been tapping the phone of Yulia Skripal. They decided to attack Sergei Skripal while his daughter was visiting from Moscow. ### In an effort to shore up the government narrative, at the time of the Amesbury attack the security services put out through Pablo Miller’s long term friend, the BBC’s Mark Urban, that the Russians “may have been” tapping Yulia Skripal’s phone, and the claim that this was strong evidence that the Russians had indeed been behind the attack. ### But think this through. If that were true, then the Russians deliberately attacked at a time when Yulia was in the UK rather than when Sergei was alone. Yet no motive has been adduced for an attack on Yulia or why they would attack while Yulia was visiting – they could have painted his doorknob with less fear of discovery anytime he was alone. Furthermore, it is pretty natural that Russian intelligence would tap the phone of Yulia, and of Sergei if they could. The family of double agents are normal targets. I have no doubt in the least, from decades of experience as a British diplomat, that GCHQ have been tapping Yulia’s phone. Indeed, if tapping of phones is seriously put forward as evidence of intent to murder, the British government must be very murderous indeed. ### Their trained assassin(s) painted a novichok on the doorknob of the Skripal house in the suburbs of Salisbury. Either before or after the attack, they entered a public place in the centre of Salisbury and left a sealed container of the novichok there. ### The incompetence of the assassination beggars belief when compared to British claims of a long term production and training programme. The Russians built the heart of the International Space Station. They can kill an old bloke in Salisbury. Why did the Russians not know that the dose from the door handle was not fatal? Why would trained assassins leave crucial evidence lying around in a public place in Salisbury? Why would they be conducting any part of the operation with the novichok in a public area in central Salisbury? ### Why did nobody see them painting the doorknob? This must have involved wearing protective gear, which would look out of place in a Salisbury suburb. With Skripal being resettled by MI6, and a former intelligence officer himself, it beggars belief that MI6 did not fit, as standard, some basic security including a security camera on his house. ### The Skripals both touched the doorknob and both functioned perfectly normally for at least five hours, even able to eat and drink heartily. Then they were simultaneously and instantaneously struck down by the nerve agent, at a spot in the city centre coincidentally close to where the assassins left a sealed container of the novichok lying around. Even though the nerve agent was eight times more deadly than Sarin or VX, it did not kill the Skripals because it had been on the doorknob and affected by rain. ### Why did they both touch the outside doorknob in exiting and closing the door? Why did the novichok act so very slowly, with evidently no feeling of ill health for at least five hours, and then how did it strike both down absolutely simultaneously, so that neither can call for help, despite their being different sexes, weights, ages, metabolisms and receiving random completely uncontrolled doses. The odds of that happening are virtually nil. And why was the nerve agent ultimately ineffective? ### Detective Sergeant Bailey attended the Skripal house and was also poisoned by the doorknob, but more lightly. None of the other police who attended the house were affected. ### Why was the Detective Sergeant affected and nobody else who attended the house, or the scene where the Skripals were found? Why was Bailey only lightly affected by this extremely deadly substance, of which a tiny amount can kill? ### Four months later, Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess were rooting about in public parks, possibly looking for cigarette butts, and accidentally came into contact with the sealed container of a novichok. They were poisoned and Dawn Sturgess subsequently died. ### If the nerve agent had survived four months because it was in a sealed container, why has this sealed container now mysteriously disappeared again? If Rowley and Sturgess had direct contact straight from the container, why did they not both die quickly? Why had four months searching of Salisbury and a massive police, security service and military operation not found this container, if Rowley and Sturgess could? ### I am, with a few simple questions, demolishing what is the most ludicrous conspiracy theory I have ever heard – the Salisbury conspiracy theory being put forward by the British government and its corporate lackies. ### My next post will consider some more plausible explanations of this affair. ### Tags"

Each Land Rover represented a year of manufacture, from the very earliest of 1948 Series I through to the new 2018 Range Rover. ### See also... ### * Great classic Land Rovers for sale! ### Led by The Dunsfold Collection's Phillip Bashall in a recreation of the very first vehicle to set the Land Rover template – Rover’s Centre Steer prototype – with ‘HUE 166’ hot on its heels, the succeeding models covered the Series I,II/IIA and III, Defender, Discovery, Range Rover, Freelander and everything else in between. ### Land Rover’s utilitarian design spawned three generations of ‘Series’ vehicles, with the one millionth example rolling out the factory gates in 1976. That very vehicle was part of the parade, joined by fire engines, SAS vehicles, aircraft crash rescue and African expedition heroes. ### Besides the group of 25 Series vehicles, the versatile breadth of 90/110 and Defender bodystyles were showcased, including a Dormobile, cherry picker and host of emergency response vehicles. ### Calum, our staff writer, was lucky enough to be behind the wheel of Land Rover's sole surviving 40th Anniversary Ninety. You can read about his experience here . ### All four generations of Range Rover featured in the convoy, including the celebrated Trans-Americas Expedition example, famous for crossing the all-but-impassable Darién Gap in 1971, followed by a 2004 example employed by Cheshire Police. ### Also present was Land Rover’s Discovery lineage, represented by examples from all five incarnations, featuring the round-the-world expedition model, the first Discovery ever built and the millionth Discovery to roll off the line. ### The Camel Trophy was embodied by Bob Ives and his 1989 event-winning Land Rover 110 – battle scars still very much intact. The Japanese team’s Discovery 1 could also be spotted in the parade. ### Representing Land Rover’s very latest crop of off-road vehicles was an example of each of the latest line-up; Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, Velar, Discovery, Discovery Sport, Evoque and Evoque Convertible. ### Jaguar Land Rover UK Sales Director, Scott Dicken said: ‘As we continue to celebrate Land Rover’s 70th Anniversary throughout 2018, today was a real highlight. ### ‘The vast breadth of vehicles here from fire engines, tow trucks, to expedition vehicles demonstrated the capability that is core to Land Rover name.’ ### ‘I would like to express our gratitude to all the owners, collectors and enthusiasts who joined us today.’ ### The full list of Land Rover models which took part: ### Land Rover Series I Centre Steer Replica ### Land Rover Series I"

Some stayed at barriers erected by police to try to register their complaints as the world leaders sped by in armor-plated vehicles for their summit at Finland's presidential palace. ### Others marched by Helsinki landmarks, far away from the leaders' gathering but in clear view of curious residents and tourists. ### At the city's Senate Square, about 20 male ""pregnant Trumps"" and 20 women wearing pink gags railed against a Trump order reinstating what critics call a ""global gag rule"" that bans providing federal money to international family-planning groups that perform abortions or provide information about them. ### Another march that drew hundreds of people was a mishmash of messages — some supporting German Chancellor Angela Merkel and some shouting ""Fascists go home!""  Some marchers questioned the legitimacy of Trump's election victory since he lost the popular vote. Another sign read: ""A woman's place is in the Resistance."" ### ""I don't think the two people meeting today are going to care whether we are here or not, frankly,"" said Helsinki protesters Tina Aspiala, 43. ""It's more of a global solidarity against a lot of things that are messed up, and I think that that's why it's worth coming out."" ### Some marchers had professionally designed banners while others scrawled slogans like ""Not Welcome"" onto homemade posters or warned of a looming apocalypse. ### On Sunday, 1,500 people marched through the city to promote human and sexual rights, democracy and environmental issues. Organizers for ""Helsinki Calling"" said the protest wasn't aimed directly against the U.S. or Russian presidents but was designed to focus on key global issues. ### ""We celebrate the Helsinki spirit here,"" said Timo Heikkinen, a 50-year-old from Helsinki.  ""And we welcome everybody who respects human rights and democracy and doesn't share fake news."" ### ___"

It’s nearly 22 feet long and five-and-a-half feet tall. Putin took a ride in it from one building inside the Kremlin to another on his inauguration day in May. It replaces the stretch Mercedes that long ferried Putin around. ### “This is the first high-end luxury car manufactured domestically in many years,” says a Russian state media webpage about the Kortezh, in a nod to the old Cold War days in which Soviet-made Zil limousines ferried Communist leaders around. (To be sure, the Kortezh engine was developed in conjunction with Germany’s Porsche.) ### Finns had spotted the cars in Helsinki, but the Kremlin even turned the question of whether Putin would ride in one of them into a mystery. ### “What car will Vladimir Vladimirovich [Putin] use to move around Helsinki?” an interviewer for pro-Kremlin broadcaster RT asked Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov in an interview published Monday. ### “You’ll see,” Peskov responded. ### Anton Troianovski Anton Troianovski is The Washington Post's Moscow bureau chief.

9575,dailymail.co.uk,2018-07-15T06:34:13-04:00,"e-mail ### By Robin Emmott ### BRUSSELS, July 13 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's portrayal of NATO as an alliance in crisis has raised concern that the U.S. president's nagging criticism might erode U.S. public support and risk America's commitment to collective defence, diplomats said. ### Allies emerged confused and shaken from a two-day NATO summit in which Trump harangued them over perceived under- spending on defence, accused Germany of being a prisoner to Russian energy and prompted an emergency meeting of leaders trying to contain the fallout from the unexpected tirade at one session. ### NATO diplomats complained that the drama around Trump's forthright comments had overshadowed big decisions that the allies took in areas from defence spending to new weapons and strategies to address Russia's efforts to destabilise the West through cyber and covert attacks. ### ""There was a gap between the Trumpian-generated idea that there is some kind of crisis and the reality that this was one of the most substantial summits for years,"" one senior NATO diplomatic source told Reuters. ### Having questioned the value of NATO in tweets throughout the summit, Trump later told reporters that the 29-member military alliance ""was not doing what they were supposed to be doing"" until he came to Brussels and that he was ""extremely unhappy"" until his intervention. ### Then he claimed ""total credit"" for increases in defence spending, although they were in fact agreed in 2014, and warned that ""NATO is helping Europe more than it is helping us,"" in language that did not make a public case for unity. ### However, the summit also agreed on a new training mission for Iraq, an invitation for Balkan state Macedonia to join NATO and more funding for troops in Afghanistan. ### While Trump did let the 79-point summit declaration go through, his assertion that ""I've taken over a lot of bad hands and I am fixing them,"" at the end of the summit left the impression there were serious problems at NATO, diplomats said. ### NATO may now need its friends in the U.S. Congress and in the Republican and Democratic parties to speak out more to prevent permanent damage to alliance's image in the United States, they said. ### The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly approved a motion in support of NATO on the eve of this week's summit, and former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called for more. ### ""Enough,"" the Democrat said of Trump's style at the summit. ""This isn't good for the United States and there are people across the aisle - as the Senate vote yesterday clearly showed - who know it and need to say it,"" Kerry said on Twitter. ### PERCEPTION, REALITY ### The summit decisions, agreed by all 29 allied governments, won hardly any sustained public attention and the underlying unity was undercut by Trump's claims he had won new pledges in defence spending, forcing the French and Italian leaders into denials that dominated post-summit news conferences. ### He reiterated that claim in Britain on Friday. ### ""The concern is that this is not just noise to disregard, because perception is reality and this president may be with us for another six years,"" the senior source said. ### NATO, founded in 1949 to contain a military threat from the Soviet Union, relies on the United States' military superiority to face down a host of threats on Europe's borders, including a resurgent, nuclear-armed Russia and militant attacks. ### A commitment to defend each other is the bedrock of the alliance and any suggestion that the United States would not come to Europe's aid because, as Trump has suggested, they owe ""massive"" sums, could be a blow to its deterrence. ### ""President Trump has not taken damaging actions against NATO, but his words are damaging,"" said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO and now director of the European Leadership Network think-tank in London. ### Having lambasted NATO for failing to reach a target of 2 percent of national income on defence, Trump told fellow leaders in Brussels he would prefer a goal of 4 percent, similar to U.S. levels, and then claimed victory for forcing countries to move. ### He also said he expected an easier meeting with Russian President Vladimir on Monday in Helsinki in remarks that contrast with the West's accusations that Moscow is seeking to undermine European democracies. ### NO MORE SUMMITS? ### One option aired by diplomats is to scrap regular NATO summits altogether and return to the era of the 1980s, when such leaders-level gatherings were less common and when much of the decision-making was taken by defence and foreign ministers. ### But Thomson said that was not realistic. ""You cannot ignore Trump, he will find a way to make himself heard."" ### Some European officials feel strongly that NATO should be more confident in calling out Trump's mis-statements about the alliance. ### Trump's claims that the United States pays for 90 percent of European security and NATO are incorrect, NATO data shows. ### While U.S. defence spending makes up 70 percent of combined allied governments' military budgets, just 15 percent of U.S. expenditure is spent in Europe on NATO-related defence. ### Washington pays about 22 percent of the running cost of NATO, including the headquarters and commonly-funded equipment such as AWACS surveillance planes. ### Trump has also claimed Germany and others owe money to the United States and NATO, but allied contributions are voluntary and there are multiple budgets. ### At 3.5 percent, the United States' own annual defence spending is below the 4-percent-of-GDP level that Trump has said it is, NATO figures show.

Then-President Barack Obama, for example, waited until the third year of his presidency to begin campaigning and fundraising in earnest. ### In all, the three Trump-aligned committees have raised nearly $90 million since Trump took office, although his election is still more than two years away. ### But before the 2020 presidential election, Republicans are racing to protect their hold on Congress. Democrats need to flip just 23 GOP seats to take control of the U.S. House. ### Trump, who has 53.1 million Twitter followers, relies heavily on small-dollar donations to drive his campaign funding: More than 60 percent of contributions directly to his campaign flowed in amounts of $200 or smaller, according to the filing with federal election regulators. ### “We are thrilled with the continued support of so many Americans who resoundingly approve of Donald Trump’s performance as President,” Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law and a senior adviser to his campaign, said in a statement Sunday night. ### More: President Trump seizes on election rules to push his agenda in new ways ### The Trump campaign and its two other fundraising arms —Trump Victory and the Trump Make America Great Again Committee — spent more than $8.5 million on operating costs during the second quarter of the year. Those expenses ranged from legal costs to the nearly $400,000 the Trump Make America committee spent to buy t-shirts, caps and other campaign swag. ### Trump's campaign spent a little more than $338,000 on legal expenses between April 1 and June 30 — a sharp drop from the $834,670 it reported spending during the first three months of the year. ### The legal bills of Trump's campaign committee alone have topped $4.35 million since the start of the election cycle, as he, his family members and staffers deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race as well as legal challenges from Stormy Daniels, a porn star who says she had sex with Trump in 2006 . ### Trump denies the affair. Daniels is suing to break free of a confidentiality agreement she signed with Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen just days before the 2016 election. ### The campaign's legal expenses show nearly $180,000 to Jones Day, which has represented the campaign in parts of the Russian investigation. ### Among the smaller payments: $12,300 in April to Charles Harder, a Beverly Hills attorney representing Trump in the Daniels' case. Harder also sought unsuccessfully to stop the publication of an unflattering book on Trump's White House. ### Earlier this year, Trump allies set up a separate legal expense account, the Patriot Legal Expense Fund, as a way for Trump aides caught up in the Russia investigation to pay their bills. Details on what it has raised and spent have not yet been disclosed. ### Contributing: Christopher Schnaars"

The system is blinking. It is why I believe we are at a critical point,"" Coats said, addressing the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C., on Friday. ### Related Content ### Lawmakers: Facebook's relationship with Russian company deserves scrutiny ### ""Today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack,"" he said. ### Coats compared the ""warning signs"" to those the United States faced ahead of the September 11 terrorist attacks. ### ""It was in the months prior to September 2001 when, according to then-CIA Director George Tenet, the system is blinking red. And here we are nearly two decades later, and I'm here to say, the warning lights are blinking red again,"" Coats said. ### Coats said the ""worst offenders"" are Russia, China, Iran and North Korea -- with Russia the ""most aggressive foreign actor, no question. And they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy."" ### Every day, those countries ""are penetrating our digital infrastructure and conducting a range of cyber intrusions and attacks against targets in the United States,"" he said. ### Some of their targets include the federal government, the U.S. military, state and local governments, and U.S. businesses, he said. ### Coats' comments came the same day that the Justice Department announced the indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence agents, accusing them of engaging in a ""sustained effort"" to hack Democrats' emails and computer networks during the 2016 election. ### Coats referred to the indictments and alluded to upcoming election threats, but said ""focusing on the potential impact of these actions, on our midterm election, misses the more important point: These actions are persistent, they're pervasive, and they are meant to undermine America's democracy on a daily basis, regardless of whether it is election time or not. Russia actors and others are exploring vulnerabilities in our critical infrastructure as well."" ### Coats added, ""What's serious about the Russians is their intent. They have capabilities, but it's their intent to undermine our basic values, undermine democracy, create wedges between us and our allies."" ### Coats pointed to the indictment as showing ""exactly what they're trying to do or what they've done through their military intelligence relative to elections."" ### So far, he said, the United States is ""not yet seeing the kind of electoral interference in specific states and in voter databases that we experienced in 2016"" by the Kremlin. ### ""However, we realize we are just one click of the keyboard away from a similar situation repeating itself,"" he warned. ### Trump is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin one-on-one in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday. Trump said he intends to raise the 2016 election meddling during his discussion with Putin. ### While Coats will not be sitting down with Putin, he was asked Friday what his message to Putin would be if he was given the chance to speak with the Russian leader. ### ""My message would be: We know what you're doing, and we know you know what you're doing and what we're doing.

Add your two cents. ### Despite John McCain and the neocon’s best efforts to disrupt it, his advisors (and the Democrats) warnings, and the rest of the Deep State’s concerted plans with the liberal media to paint Trump into a lose-lose situation, the Trump-Putin Summit in Helsinki is due to start within the next hour or two. ### As President Trump noted in a tweet earlier, “Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough.” ### As The Hill notes, Trump has long wanted a closer relationship with Putin, something he believes can mend frayed ties between their two countries. But beyond his apparent affinity for Putin, many in Washington have questioned why the president is sitting down with his Russian counterpart and what he seeks to accomplish. ### Here are five things to watch for when Trump and Putin meet in Helsinki: ### Election interference ### Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, already at the front of observers’ minds, has rocketed to the top of the agenda ahead of Monday’s summit. Deputy Attorney General  Rod Rosenstein  announced Friday  the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers  who allegedly hacked into the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic groups. The announcement comes just days before the Helsinki summit,  ramping up pressure  on Trump to raise the issue with Putin. But the president has long wavered on the matter, despite the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in the election. Just last month, Trump tweeted that “Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!” ### Trump has repeatedly highlighted that denial — which Putin made during their first face-to-face meeting at last year’s group of Group of 20 summit — as a way of downplaying the issue. “President Trump is now the outlier in his own administration, seemingly,” said a former Trump transition official. The president has promised multiple times to press Putin on election interference, saying Friday he would “absolutely firmly ask the question” when they meet. Trump has expressed a belief, however, there is not much he can do to deter their activity. “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it, I did it, you got me.’ There won’t be a Perry Mason here,” Trump said at a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. ### National security figures with ties to the White House hope Trump publicly warns Putin against interfering in the midterms and threatens the Russian leader with consequences. ### But the worst-case scenario they fear is Trump remaining silent on the issue and raising the possibility of lifting sanctions on Moscow, something that would fuel criticism from political opponents who believe he is too close to Putin. ### Democrats in Congress have called on Trump to cancel the summit entirely in response to the indictment, but there is no sign Trump is interested in doing so. ### Syria ### Trump has reportedly been eying a deal with Putin in Syria that is aimed at moving Iranian forces away from the border with Israel in exchange for withdrawing U.S. troops. But both U.S. and Russian officials have been reluctant to give ground on thorny issues such as troop levels or territory, and experts are not optimistic a deal will be made in Helsinki. “To me, this whole issue of expecting the Russians or hoping the Russians are going to deliver Iranian concessions in Syria is the triumph of blind hope over grim analysis,” said Robert Ford, former U.S. ambassador to Syria under former President Obama. ### Under the terms of a possible deal, Russia would promise to limit Iranian presence near Syria’s border with Israel and Jordan and, in turn, the U.S. would allow Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces to take control of the area. U.S. forces have an outpost in southern Syria near the border with Jordan and Iraq known as al Tanf, which Pentagon officials have said is key to ensuring Iran does not complete the Tehran-to-Beirut land bridge it desires. But under the reported deal, U.S. forces would leave al Tanf — and eventually Syria — altogether. Experts have warned Trump not to repeat the mistakes of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, when he did not come away with an ironclad plan for denuclearization. ### “If he buys a vague promise, then it looks like the Singapore summit where he gets some nice words without details from the other side of the summit table,” said Ford. ### Crimea ### Crimea has been at the heart of U.S.-Russia tensions since 2014. That’s when Russia annexed the peninsula off Ukraine, sparking a wave of international sanctions and other measures aimed at isolating Moscow. But Trump has repeatedly left the door open to recognizing Russia’s claim over Crimea during his meeting with Putin, even repeating Moscow’s talking point that it has a rightful claim to the territory because most residents speak Russian. The president stoked further concern this week when he again did not rule out the possibility during his press conference at the end of the tumultuous NATO summit. ### “That’s an interesting question, because long before I got here President Obama allowed that to happen, that was under his watch, not my watch,” Trump said. “What will happen with Crimea from this point on? That, I can’t tell you.” ### One of the post-Crimea punishments for Russia was getting booted from the then-Group of Eight world economic powers. But last month, on his way to the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said that should be reversed. “Russia should be in this meeting,” he said at the time. “Why are we having a meeting without Russia being in the meeting?” ### The U.S. and its European allies stepped up their military posture and exercises in Eastern Europe after the Crimea annexation. But after Trump unilaterally agreed to cancel joint military exercises with South Korea during his summit with North Korea’s Kim, allies are fearful of him doing the same with Putin. Republicans in Congress are cautioning Trump against a repeat performance. “I think the president should listen to his security council and our secretary of Defense and our NATO allies on anything of substance dealing with the U.S. military posture. We’ve got to be careful, we’ve got to be strong,” said Sen.  Richard Shelby  (R-Ala.), who recently led a congressional delegation to Russia. ### Arms control ### Trump has said one of his top priorities for the summit is arms control, a topic that could produce a rare opportunity for the U.S. and Russia to find common ground. Arms control advocates say Trump can score an easy win with Putin by agreeing to extend the New START Treaty for another five years. The treaty, negotiated by the Obama administration, caps the U.S. and Russia’s deployed nuclear warheads to 1,550 each and comes up for renewal in 2021. “[Renewal] would ensure that we do not return to a numerical arms race,” said Thomas Countryman, former assistant secretary of State on international security and nonproliferation. ### But most experts do not believe a decision on New START will come at the summit. Trump has dismissed the treaty as one of Obama’s “bad deals,” and it could take some convincing to get him on board. Republicans have argued the treaty should not be extended while Russia is in violation of a separate arms control agreement known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. That agreement, which has been credited with helping end the Cold War, bans ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. The United States has repeatedly accused Russia of violating the INF Treaty by developing and deploying a banned missile, a charge Moscow denies. ### The summit could provide an opportunity for Trump to address the INF violation directly with Putin, but experts say Russia has shown little appetite for reversing course. ### Stagecraft ### Even more than contentious policy issues, the visuals could be the most memorable part of the Trump-Putin summit. Trump and Putin  will hold a joint press conference , which should be a spectacle in and of itself and give U.S. media a chance to rare opportunity to press the Russian leader on election meddling and other key issues. It could cause problems for Trump if he appears too friendly with Putin, especially given the timing of the meeting, just days after the hacking indictments. ### But Trump’s desire to form a close bond with Putin could lead the president to give his Russian counterpart a warm reception, just like he did with Kim in Singapore. It could fuel criticism back home that Trump has a greater affinity for strongmen than he does for longtime U.S. allies. ### Days before the summit, Trump was shown grimacing during a group photo with NATO partners in Brussels and rolled his eyes when he was asked during a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May about critical comments he made about the U.K. leader. Putin, a former KGB officer with a flair for the dramatic, could also have some tricks up his sleeve. ### The Russian leader  frequently shows up late  for meetings with world leaders, even forcing Pope Francis to wait for 50 minutes before a 2015 sit-down in Vatican City. Putin even brought his pet Labrador to a 2007 meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has a well-known fear of dogs. The Russian president later said he did not mean to scare Merkel and claimed he apologized after learning she is scared of dogs. ### *  *  * ### And in case it’s not immediately obvious, as Jim Jatras recently noted, there are many reasons the bipartisan US establishment hates Trump. His heresies from neoliberal orthodoxies on immigration and trade are prominent. But top among them is his oft-stated intention to improve relations with Russia. ### That’s fighting words for the Deep State and its mainstream media arm, for which demonizing Russia and its president Vladimir Putin is an obsession. ### The fact that Donald Trump made his intention to get along with Moscow a priority during his 2016 campaign, both against his Republican primary rivals and Hillary Clinton (who has compared Putin to Hitler) was cause for alarm. This is because far more than even the frightening prospect that the 70-year state of war on the Korean Peninsula might end, US reconciliation with Russia would yank the rug out from under the phony justifications for spending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to counter a “threat” that ceased to exist over a quarter century ago. Absent hostility to Russia that money has no reason to keep sustaining the power, privilege, and prosperity of a horde of moochers and profiteers, both at home and abroad. ### That’s why when it was reported soon after his January 2017 inauguration that Trump was seeking to open dialogue with the Kremlin and set an early summit with Putin there was a hysterical counteraction. ### *  *  * ### Finally, watch out for any ‘hot mic’ incidents, because it would very awkward if a president on the United States was caught offering himself up to a Russian leader… ### Trump never colluded with the Russians, but guess who did?"

9765,politico.com,2018-07-15T14:58:03-04:00,"Trump-Putin summit mystery: What about Snowden? ### President Donald Trump has shown no desire to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin about  Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency whistleblower pictured here last year. | Alexander Koerner/Getty Images ### Trump-Putin summit mystery: What about Snowden? ### Trump has called for the fugitive NSA leaker’s execution and once guaranteed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would hand him over. But there’s no sign that Trump is pressing the issue. ### Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ### As President Donald Trump prepares to meet Vladimir Putin on Monday, lawmakers from both parties want him to demand that the Russian president hand over 12 hackers newly indicted for sabotaging the 2016 election. That’s unlikely, especially since Trump mostly shrugs off talk of Russian election meddling. ### But Putin is also harboring another hacker wanted by the U.S. — one whose guilt Trump has never questioned: Edward Snowden. ### Story Continued Below ### As a candidate, Trump “guarantee[d]” he would bring home the infamous National Security Agency whistleblower. As president, however, he has shown no desire to confront Putin about Snowden. ### Why not? Experts and former U.S. officials say that passions have cooled over the fugitive who rocked the intelligence community five years ago last month. More recent hacking scandals have overshadowed his actions. And Trump himself has become a harsh critic of U.S. surveillance programs, which he claims without evidence the Obama administration wrongly used against him. ### Even so, some experts think handing over Snowden would be an easy way for Putin to do Trump a favor — giving the president a victory that especially please intelligence and national security officials angry he hasn’t done more to counter Russian election meddling. Before Trump was sworn in last January, former deputy CIA director Michael Morell wrote that handing over Snowden would be “the perfect inauguration gift” from Putin to Trump. ### “If Trump wants this as a victory then I don’t see why Putin wouldn’t give it to him,” said Geoffrey Stone, a University of Chicago Law School professor who served on a foreign intelligence surveillance panel created by President Barack Obama shortly after Snowden’s leaks. “If Putin wants to either do a favor for Trump or make Trump look good, and if Trump wants this, it would be an easy thing for Putin to do,” Stone said. ### “You can almost see the picture of Snowden in handcuffs being dragged into Air Force One,” he added. ### The most reliable politics newsletter. ### Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.  You can unsubscribe at any time. ### Snowden sought refuge in Moscow in mid-2013 after publicly releasing troves of top secret NSA files he stole while he was a private contractor. He has called himself a whistleblower exposing surveillance abuses, but many current and former U.S. officials consider him a traitor or worse. ### Trump is among them: “Snowden is a spy who has caused great damage to the U.S. A spy in the old days, when our country was respected and strong, would be executed,” he declared on Twitter in April 2014. ### As a 2016 candidate, Trump said he could get Snowden back from the Russians, who granted him political asylum. Promising to befriend Putin and repair U.S.-Russian relations, Trump insisted that the Russian leader —who he said had no respect for President Barack Obama — would “never” keep someone like Snowden if Trump were president. ### “Look… if I'm president, Putin says [to Snowden], ‘Hey, boom, you're gone.’ I guarantee you this,” Trump said in July 2015. ### Since then, it appears Snowden has fallen off Trump’s to-do list. And some believe the Russian president likes keeping him under his wing, even at a time when he wants to strike deals with Trump. ### “I don’t think it’s high on Trump’s agenda and actually, I don’t think Putin has a big interest in extraditing him,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch and a leading defender of Snowden’s “heroic” leaks. ### Snowden remains in hiding in Russia with his partner Lindsay Mills, mostly keeping a low profile. Just last month, however, Mills shared a rare photo of Snowden on her Instagram account, at what appears to be a restaurant overlooking the Moscow skyline. ### By QUINT FORGEY ### Snowden himself addressed the possibility of extradition in May, in a podcast interview with The Intercept. ### “Donald Trump is going to be coming out to Russia, you know, whenever he can,” Snowden told journalist Mehdi Hasan, before Monday’s meeting in Helsinki had been announced. ### “It seems clear there is no one in this world he loves more than the Russian president. Will he try to make some kind of deal? Maybe,” he added. “Can I do anything about it? No.” ### Trump is not the only top U.S. official to have called for Snowden’s return and execution. As a member of Congress in 2016, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo echoed Trump’s opinion. “He should be brought back from Russia and given due process and I think the proper outcome would be that he would be given a death sentence,” Pompeo told C-Span in February of that year. ### Snowden’s ACLU lawyer Ben Wizner declined to comment for this article. ### Following the beginning of his June 2013 leaks, Snowden commanded world headlines for months. But even as top lawmakers demanded the extradition of 25 Russians who have now been indicted by the Justice Department for 2016 election interference, Snowden went unmentioned. ### ""These individuals must be brought to the United States so that they can stand trial, and you should demand that Mr. Putin hand them over,” eight senior Democratic Senators, including the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote in a Saturday letter to Trump that did not mention the former NSA contractor. ### If Putin did send Snowden back to the United States, he’d await trial in a prison cell. The espionage charges against him carry decades of jail time and bar him from using a whistleblower defense in trial. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told Russia in 2013 the U.S. would not seek the death penalty for Snowden, as a way to prevent Russia from granting the former contractor political asylum. Holder told Russia the charges against Snowden did not carry a death penalty, and the government would not pursue the death penalty even if he were charged with additional crimes that carry a death penalty. But it’s not clear whether Trump’s Justice Department would agree. ### Even some of Snowden’s fiercest critics suggest that Helsinki is not the place to discuss his fate, especially if Trump and Putin will be confronting substantive policy issues like the Middle East. ### By MICHAEL CROWLEY and ANNIE KARNI ### “If the effort is to frame up a solution to Syria then he shouldn’t come up. If it is more of a ceremonial meeting then it would be appropriate for the topic to be on the agenda,” said Mike Rogers, who served as the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee at the time of Snowden’s leaks. ### Rogers has denounced Snowden as a traitor who put American lives at risk — even once saying, without specific evidence, that he should face murder charges. But he suggested that Moscow itself, where some believe Snowden’s freedom is limited, is a kind of prison for him. ### “He is absolutely miserable in a very controlled environment in Russia. May be the best punishment,” Rogers told POLITICO in an email. ### Matthew Waxman, director of the National Security Law Program at Columbia Law School and a former senior George W. Bush administration official, said he doesn’t expect Snowden to come up at Monday’s summit. ### But it’s impossible to be sure, he added — especially given the Trumpian spectacle Snowden’s return would involve. ### “Trump is unpredictable, and he seems sometimes to care more about the showmanship of deals than their substance,” he said. ### Waxman added that Putin “will have studied Trump's psychology carefully,” and could offer up Snowden if he thought it would help him win other agreements from his American counterpart. ### At the time of the leaks, Trump said it would be “pathetic” if the United States took years to get Snowden back on American soil. And in other interviews, Trump blamed the slow pace of extradition on former President Barack Obama’s tense relationship with Putin. ### “He hates Obama. He doesn't respect Obama. Obama doesn't like him either. But he has no respect for Obama. Has a hatred for Obama,” Trump said. ### But where Putin sits now, Snowden might be more useful inside Russia than out. Some critics say Snowden has been notably quiet overall about Russia’s authoritarian practices, even as he castigates at the Trump administration, U.S. intelligence agencies, and many American technology companies on a Twitter account with 3.8 million followers. ### “Snowden represents a rare case of somebody who is seeking Russia rather than fleeing Putin’s autocratic rule,” Roth said. “That’s a way to make his own autocratic rule seem less bad ... He’s much more valuable from Putin’s perspective in highlighting the U.S. government’s mass invasion of privacy.” ### Snowden insists he does not not turn a blind eye to abuses within Russia for his own safety. Asked by The Intercept about the possibility of his extradition, he said: “[W]ould I sell out my principles to make that less likely? No.” And he did recently criticize “ballot stuffing” in Russia’s March presidential election, which installed Putin for another six-year term, raising fresh speculation that whatever alliance he might have with Putin’s government is cracking. ### “Demand justice; demand laws and courts that matter. Take your future back,” Snowden added. ### Roth said he doubts that conservative Republicans still care much about Snowden, diminishing Trump’s interest in him. ### “I have no doubt Trump would like to get Snowden,” Roth said. “I’m not sure this is an issue that plays with his base... I don’t see him really going to bat on this issue.” ### One reason some doubt that Putin would send Snowden back to the U.S. is that Russia last year extended his asylum until 2020. Russian officials maintain they cannot remove him against his will. ### ""President Putin addressed the issue some years ago,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview last month. ""He said this is for Edward Snowden to decide."" ### Lavrov added that Putin has ""never"" discussed Snowden with the Trump administration. ### “We respect his rights as an individual,” Lavrov said. “I don’t know why people would start asking this particular question in relation to the Summit. Edward Snowden is the master of his own destiny."""

Barnes New York Times ### July 14, 2018 — 5:07pm ### Purchase: Order Reprint ### WASHINGTON – The nation’s top intelligence officer said Friday that the persistent danger of Russian cyberattacks today was akin to the warnings the U.S. had of stepped-up terror threats before the Sept. 11 attacks. ### That note of alarm sounded by Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, came on the same day that 12 Russian agents were indicted on charges of hacking the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Coats said those indictments illustrated Moscow’s continuing strategy to undermine the United States’ democracy and erode its institutions. ### “The warning lights are blinking red again,” Coats said as he cautioned of cyberthreats. “Today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack.” ### Coming just days before President Donald Trump’s meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, Coats’ comments demonstrate the persistent divisions within the administration on Russia. ### Trump has said he would raise the issue of Russian election interference with Putin during their meeting in Helsinki. And Trump regularly cites some strong actions his administration has taken to punish Moscow, such as expelling 60 Russians accused of intelligence activities. But Trump and the White House also routinely minimize information about the impact of Moscow’s cyberattacks and intrusion efforts on the 2016 election. ### The government’s national security agencies, particularly the intelligence agencies, have been far more concerned about Russia’s 2016 interference campaign — and efforts still underway. ### Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana, has helped position the intelligence agencies in the more hard-line camp, pushing for more aggressive actions to halt cyberattacks by Russia and other nations. ### In his remarks on Friday, Coats did not directly address Trump’s coming meeting with Putin. But Coats did say that if he was meeting the Russian president, he would deliver a sharp message that the United States knows what the Russians are doing and that Putin’s government is responsible for the cyberattacks. ### Coats said Russian and other actors were exploring vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and trying to infiltrate energy, water, nuclear and manufacturing sectors. “These actions are persistent, they are pervasive and they are meant to undermine America’s democracy,” Coats said."

The year was 2010, and then Defense Secretary Robert Gates pressured his Russian counterpart to rescind military assistance to Tehran, specifically the promised delivery of the advanced S-300 air defense system. Ultimately, the Russians agreed to postpone their deal with Iran, essentially selling out their client. ### The Trump administration should study this recent episode as the president heads to Helsinki to meet Vladimir Putin. Trump is allegedly eager to secure Russian assistance in significantly reducing or eliminating Iran’s military presence in Syria. The S-300 decision shows Moscow can be persuaded to act against Iran, albeit with difficulty. ### ADVERTISEMENT ### For sure, convincing Russia to help constrain Iran in Syria will be a much tougher proposition than deferring the S-300. Putin may appear the dominant partner in the Moscow-Tehran-Damascus triangle, and Russian airpower, money and diplomatic clout provides appreciable sway over Assad. Yet Iranian entrenchment in Syria is deep and pervasive and won’t be easily scaled back. ###  ### Iranian-backed ground forces and money have been vital to Assad's survival. Tehran commands thousands of IRGC, Hezbollah and foreign Shiite militiamen in Syria, as well as tens of thousands of home-grown Syrian fighters that are now being integrated into Syria’s military, but whose primary allegiance is to Iran. Pushing back this formidable threat will be a major challenge — even if Putin proves willing. ### Nevertheless, it is precisely the extent of Iran’s penetration of Syria that makes the current situation so dangerous, and an American effort to thwart it so necessary. As Assad seeks to reconquer the last opposition holdouts, he is essentially extending Iran’s future power-projection capabilities to the borders of Israel and Jordan, exponentially increasing the chances of a major Israeli-Iranian conflict that the United States would have difficulty avoiding. ### It is clearly in America’s interest to prevent Iran’s further entrenchment. Even if the prospects for securing Moscow’s cooperation aren’t good, Putin’s readiness to help should be seriously tested. National Security Advisor John Bolton had it  right when he said  recently , “There are possibilities for doing a larger negotiation on helping to get Iranian forces out of Syria… I don't think Assad is the strategic issue. I think Iran is the strategic issue.” ### Donald John Trump Reporters defend CNN's Acosta after White House says he 'disrespected' Trump with question Security costs of Trump visit to Scotland sparks outrage among Scottish citizens Ex-CIA officer: Prosecution of Russians indicted for DNC hack 'ain't ever going to happen' MORE should have no illusions about Russia’s willingness to help the United States in Syria. As in the past, Putin’s instinct will be to do the minimum necessary to gain U.S. consent for Assad's reassertion of control throughout Syria. Given the president’s  oft-stated  eagerness to “come home” from Syria as soon as possible, Putin may believe a few vague promises from Russia to work for an Iranian withdrawal will be enough for the United States to pack up and leave. ### Trump must disabuse Putin of that perception in Helsinki and deal with Russia from a position of maximum leverage. The S-300 episode offers guidance on how that might be done. ### First, the United States and its allies must present a united front to Russia. Just as echoing and emphasizing Israel’s concerns helped Washington convince Moscow that the S-300 deal could risk important Russian equities, President Trump must convey to Putin the unanimous opposition to Iran’s military presence in Syria from America and its regional allies, including Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and U.A.E. ### Second, the United States must negotiate from a position of strength. In 2010, Israel could credibly threaten preemptive military action against Iran, which Moscow sought to avoid. Similarly, President Trump must be clear with Putin, and by extension Assad, that so long as Iranian entrenchment in Syria persists, Israel will have total U.S. support if its escalating operations against Iran trigger a major war – even if it jeopardizes Russia’s entire project to salvage the Assad regime. ### Finally, the deal needs a sweetener. Russia only agreed to scrap the S-300 deal after Israel agreed to sell it advanced drones. Trump should tell Putin that, while we are prepared to withdraw U.S. forces from the vital strategic terrain they control in southern and eastern Syria — a major aim of both Russia and the Assad regime – we will only do so after the permanent removal of all Iranian-backed forces has been fully verified, and adequate protections are in place for the security and rights of our local partners in Syria that proved so crucial in the fight against Islamic State. ### The president must head to Helsinki clear-eyed — both about the small probability of Russia joining the United States, Israel and others in rolling back Iran's entrenchment in Syria, and about the strength and resolve he must demonstrate for Putin to take U.S. interests seriously. But given the stakes involved, it is worth testing if Russia, once again, can be convinced to constrain Iran. ### VADM John Bird, USN (ret.) is former commander of U.S. 7th Fleet.

Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British Queen, among many others. ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn't ""expect anything"" from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China.

The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."" ### View Comments"

Undeterred, the American president is set to go face-to-face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### Trump, who has been trying to lower expectations about what the meeting will achieve, told reporters during a breakfast Monday morning with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompting a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a witch hunt. ### Recommended Video: ### Now Playing: ### After the NATO summit, President Trump heads to Helsinki to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, raising concerns for both American allies and lawmakers. They worry that Trump may end up making too many concessions, as he did during his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. “It seems as though this president enjoys to give away the store to individuals who have been antagonistic towards us,” says Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The committee sent a letter to the president on Tuesday urging him to stay wary of Putin. ### Media: Cheddar TV ### Trump continued to undermine the investigation in a series of tweets from Helsinki before the meeting, blaming it for fraying U.S.-Russian relations. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,"" he wrote, blaming ""many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" ### He also continued to blame his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election in his favor, claiming that when Obama ""was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it."" ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV spectacle that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin's primary mission was simply to have the summit happen. Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one-on-one in the Finnish presidential palace's opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will then take questions at a press conference before going their separate ways. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow's attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America's closest allies, as a ""foe."" ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump's jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over ""delinquent"" defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### ""NATO is now strong & rich!"" Trump wrote in a celebratory tweet Monday morning. During his breakfast, he said NATO had ""never been more together"" and said the summit had been ""a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love."" ### Ahead of his sit-down with with Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump has continued to unleash a series of attacks on the media, including as Air Force One descended into Helsinki. ### ""Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" Trump tweeted. ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!"" ### ""Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,"" said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, ""not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime."" ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week — another chaotic stop on his European tour — that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said ""certainly I'll be asking about it"" although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can't force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a ""shameful comedy"" staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn't contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria's border with Israel — a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia's carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level. ### ___"

They are going to interfere in our elections, we also do the same,” Paul said. ### The comments, which come just a day before President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, show a realism that neither staunch Republicans or Democrats discuss, which is that Russia attempted various hacking and disinformation campaigns surrounding the 2016 election to discredit former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ### “I would say it’s not morally equivalent,” Paul said of Russia’s election meddling relating to America’s campaigns to influence foreign elections. “But I think in [Russia’s] mind it is. It’s important to know in your adversary’s mind the way they perceive thing. They react to our interference in their elections and one of the reasons they didn’t like Hillary Clinton, they found her responsible for some of the activity by the U.S. in their elections under the [Former President Barack] Obama administration,” Paul said. (RELATED: Rand Paul Says To Be Aware of Russia’s Perspective After Voting Against Motion Calling For NATO Expansion) ### The special counsel investigation into Russian meddling led by Robert Mueller filed indictments Friday against 12 Russians connected to state intelligence services for allegedly hacking and attempting to hack the Democratic National Committee and other organizations to steal privileged information leading up to the 2016 election. ### Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said that there was “no allegation in this indictment that the Americans knew that they were corresponding with Russian intelligence officers” in announcing the charges. ### Paul said that there were other ways to protect America’s electoral system, since it’s unlikely that foreign countries will stop trying to influence our elections. ### “We all do it,” Paul said of spying and election meddling. “We need to make sure or electoral process is protected,” Paul said. Because the Russia issue has become intensely partisan, “we’ve forgotten the most important thing is the integrity of the election,” Paul said. ### Paul advocates making sure electronic records are “decentralized and we don’t store all of the data in one place even for a state.” Paul also advocated for a backup system. ### Most of Russia’s meddling came in the form of advertising online, and that’s trickier to stop. “Can we restrict the Russians? We might be able to in some ways,” Paul said, but emphasized that it’s not reasonable to expect the Russians to admit their attempts to interfere. ### “We’ve wanted Russians to admit it. They are not going to admit it, the same way we’re not going to admit we were involved in the Ukrainian elections or in the Russian elections. So all countries that can spy interfere, do. All countries that want to interfere in elections and have the ability to, they try,” Paul said."

There's no official agenda but the civil war in Syria, the Ukraine conflict and North Korea are likely talking points. ### The summit in Finland, chosen for its neutrality in the Cold War era, will be the first formal meeting between the leaders who have both expressed admiration for each other in the past. ### Anadolu Agency | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images ### Russia's President Vladimir Putin (front L) and US President Donald Trump (rear R) are seen during a meeting of world leaders on the closing day of the 25th APEC Summit, in Da Nang, Vietnam on November 11, 2017. ### However, the meeting comes amid wider tensions between the U.S. and Russia over Syria, with Russia's military intervention on behalf of President Bashar Assad; sanctions, for Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and role in a pro-Russian uprising in Ukraine; and cyber security, with Russia accused of meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. ### Naturally, the press is having a field day ahead of the meeting. Here's a selection of comments from European media outlets. ### Geopolitical win, political risk ### Many in the European press see the meeting as an advantage for an experienced political player like Putin, who continues to ride high in opinion polls and appears to be answerable only to himself. On the contrary, the meeting could prove risky for Trump. ### As Reuters puts it, the summit is ""a potential political minefield at home for the U.S. president but a geopolitical win for Putin."" This because, given Russian allegations of meddling in the U.S. democratic process, allegedly to the benefit of Trump, any apparent closeness to the Kremlin could be viewed with suspicion. ### Just ahead of the summit, the U.S. Justice Department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democrats in an attempt to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ### In light of this, Reuters journalists Steve Holland and Andrew Osborn noted Monday that, ""For Trump, whose White House victory was actively supported by 12 Russian military intelligence agents, according to a recent U.S. indictment, and whose entourage is still being investigated for possible collusion with Moscow, the meeting is freighted with domestic political risk."" ### The U.K.'s Mail Online reporter Joe Middleton said Sunday that ""the charges put an even greater spotlight on Mr Trump's treatment of Putin , who has denied making efforts to intervene in the U.S. election that Trump unexpectedly won"" while the U.K.'s Telegraph newspaper noted that: "" It is surprising that the meeting is still going ahead. "" ### Trump and Putin both deny allegations of collusion or meddling. ### Putin's 'bag of tricks' ### The fact that Trump has insisted that no aides are present at the start of his meeting with Putin, which begins around 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET), has also raised eyebrows in the media, as well as concerns that Trump could be ""outflanked"" by a wily and more politically experienced Putin . ### CNBC's National Security reporter Amanda Macias, who's in Helsinki for the summit, spoke to anonymous sources that told her the Russian leader may ask Trump to stay out of the conflict in Ukraine , to withdraw troops from eastern Syria , and to continue talks with North Korea . ### The U.K.'s Guardian newspaper's Moscow correspondent also noted at the weekend that, ""if history is any guide, the Russian president has a large bag of tricks to push Trump off-balance. "" ### Nataliy Zemboska | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images ### Russia's President Vladimir Putin addresses (C) a rally in his support at the Luzhniki Stadium ahead of the 2018 Russian presidential election scheduled for March 18, in Moscow, Russia on March 03, 2018. ### ""There are the hours he has made guests including the Pope, the queen and Barack Obama wait; the black Labrador Koni he brought into a meeting with the non-dog loving Angela Merkel; or the time he nearly scuppered a 2006 Nato summit in Riga by attempting to lure Jacques Chirac away for a birthday dinner instead,"" Andrew Roth wrote in an opinion piece Saturday. ### ""With an erratic U.S. president who has little interest in reading briefings heading to Helsinki this week, it is hard to recall a summit that has made Western foreign policymakers more nervous,"" Roth added. ### While France's newspapers cared more about the country's World Cup win over Croatia on Sunday , Le Figaro commented on Putin's 18 years in power compared to Trump's 19 months, noting that: ""Donald Trump is the fourth president of the United States that he (Putin) is about to test, after Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama."" ### Why Helsinki? ### One of the questions raised ahead of the Putin-Trump meeting has been, “Why Helsinki? ” The location wasn’t chosen at random – the country took a neutral stance at the height of the Cold War and has been the host of a number of important meetings between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union. ### Germany’s Spiegel Online carried a feature Monday entitled “Why the Helsinki summit is so important ” in which it explored what to look out for in this “memorable encounter.” ### Spiegel journalists Christina Hebel and Roland Nelles said holding the meeting in Helsinki was telling. “Finland is not a NATO member (and) is considered neutral, which the Finns themselves do not see, after all, they are an EU country. The powerful neighbor Russia has seen the state as an important buffer against the West for decades. ### “This sets the scene for the meeting: America and Russia are rivals, as they were in the Cold War era, and summits can only take place in this state — if at all — on a neutral basis.” ### The view from Russia ### Speaking of rivalry, the sense of competition between Trump and Putin is not seen as a bad thing in either camp. Last week, Trump said he saw Putin as a ""competitor"" rather than an enemy. ### Remarking on Trump's comment ahead of the summit, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told English-language state broadcaster Russia Today that, “Competition is a positive phenomenon, I would say. Competition helps the world to develop. But there is a ‘but.’ Competition has to be fair. We need fair competition in politics, in the economy. This helps all the global processes develop."" ### Mikhail Klimentyev | TASS via Getty Images ### Russia's President Vladimir Putin (L) and US President Donald Trump talking during a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg. ### In the ""exclusive interview"" published Monday, Peskov promoted Trump and Putin's like-minded attitudes. ### ""Any head of state, when talking to their foreign counterparts, has to take care of the interests of their state. And our president is quite pragmatic, quite consistent, quite practical. He always says that he cares about the national interests of Russia, above everything else. That's why he understands the reciprocal beliefs of Donald Trump, as applied to his country,” Peskov said. “As leaders of two major powers, Trump and Putin obviously respect each other and get along well."" ### Russia might not need to do much U.S.-bashing itself, with President Trump doing it for them on Monday. Kommersant newspaper carried an article Monday that focused on Trump's Twitter diatribe following the indictment of 12 Russians for election meddling after an investigation that he called a ""witch hunt."""

The two leaders last spoke in person in November 2017 at an economic summit in Vietnam. ### Heading to Helsinki, Finland – looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia... ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 15, 2018 ### The summit is expected to touch on a variety of issues, including Russian election meddling, Syria, arms control, Putin's 2014 takeover of Crimea from Ukraine and sanctions. ### Russian meddling ### Democrats had urged Trump to cancel the summit, which is set for just days after the Justice Department issued indictments charging several Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Sunday that Putin’s ""interference in our 2016 elections and our upcoming election is a serious threat to our democracy that transcends political parties. For President Trump to meet with President Putin without expressing the outrage of the American people and securing real progress would be terrible for the United States and the security of our election system."" ### Trump told CBS News in an interview conducted Saturday that he ""hadn't thought"" about asking Putin to extradite the indicted Russians. ### WATCH: TRUMP CALLS EUROPEAN UNION A 'FOE,' SAYS RUSSIA A FOE IN 'SOME RESPECTS' ### But after being given the idea by his interviewer, Jeff Glor, Trump said, ""Certainly I'll be asking about it."" He blamed the Democratic National Committee for ""allowing themselves to be hacked."" ### The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration. Why didn’t they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election? ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 14, 2018 ### The U.S. has no extradition treaty with Moscow and cannot compel Russia to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens to foreign countries. ### But Trump did say Friday he will ""absolutely firmly ask"" Putin whether Russians interfered with the 2016 election -- which Putin has denied to Trump in the past. ### Crimea ### Speaking  on ""Fox News Sunday,""  U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman said Trump was ""highly unlikely"" to recognize Putin's forcible annexation of Crimea, but refused to rule out the possibility. ### WATCH: HUNTSMAN SAYS TRUMP IS THE 'CHIEF NEGOTIATOR' IN HELSINKI ### Trump himself has been noncommittal on the issue, saying Friday during a press conference with British Prime Minister Teresa May that “we're going to see what happens"" at the Helsinki summit. ### The president claimed ahead of his summit with Putin that the Russian president would not have invaded Crimea had he been in office, calling the globally condemned annexation an “Obama disaster.” ### Sanctions ### Putin has signaled he would like Trump to soften sanctions that Washington imposed over the annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, involvement in the Syrian civil war and allegations of Russian meddling. ### Trump signed an Aug. 2017 law imposing additional sanctions on Russia. The law bars Trump from easing many sanctions without Congress’ approval, but he can offer some relief without a nod from Congress. ### Almost 700 Russian people and companies are under U.S. sanctions. Individuals face limits on their travel and freezes on at least some of their assets, while some top Russian state banks and companies, including oil and gas giants, are effectively barred from getting financing through U.S. banks and markets. ### Syria ### The two leaders also are expected to discuss a tentative deal to move Iranian troops farther from Israel's border with Syria and Jordan, in exchange for allowing access there to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. ### U.S. officials have worried about the danger of new conflict in Syria between Israel and Iran or Iran-backed forces. The White House also seeks increased Russian oil production—a move on which Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have already agreed—to restrict Iranian export earnings. ### A National Security Council official told Fox News that Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend to prepare for the Putin meeting. ### ""Yesterday I spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump,"" Netanyahu said in Israel on Sunday. ""We discussed security and diplomatic issues arising from regional developments, chief most among them, of course, Syria and Iran. ### ""I thanked President Trump for his tough policy against Iran because since this policy has been taken, we have seen a great effect on Iran and inside Iran,"" he added. ""President Trump reiterated with sharp clarity his commitment to the security of Israel and his willingness to help Israel in various realms and, of course, I thanked him for that.'' ### Putting constraints on Iran could be the top Helsinki priority of Trump and his advisers. U.S. and Russian officials have agreed on a tentative proposal that would keep Iranian forces in Syria 27 miles from Israeli border. ### Arms control ### The last major arms agreement between Russia and the US was the 2010 New START Treaty that expires in 2021. Possible extension of the treaty may be discussed. ### The U.S. has accused Russia of testing and deploying ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs) in violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The treaty, which was negotiated in part by President Ronald Reagan and which remains in force, prohibits the U.S., Russia, and 11 other former Soviet states from testing and deploying all nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. ### Tensions between the United States and Russia took another turn for the worse in March 2018 after Putin boasted about his country’s development of several next-generation nuclear weapons systems. ### Fox News' Jason Donner and The Associated Press contributed to this report. ### Gregg Re is an editor for Fox News.

(July 15) AP ### President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump disembark from Air Force One upon arrival at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport in Helsinki Sunday, on the eve of a summit in Helsinki between president and his Russian counterpart. ### (Photo: HEIKKI SAUKKOMAA, AFP/Getty Images) ### CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE ### HELSINKI – President Donald Trump will hold a summit Monday Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. He has said he has  “low expectations” for the meeting but he is under pressure to confront Putin over alleged interference by Moscow in the 2016 presidential election. ### Here is what to watch for: ### Meddling ### Putin has repeatedly denied intervention by Moscow in the 2016 election and Trump has often taken the denials at face value. But he faces further pressure to confront Putin after a federal grand jury indicted 12 Russian intelligence agents in a plot to hack into the emails of Democratic campaign officials and leak those emails via Russian-sponsored web sites. That's on top of more than a dozen Russians previously indicted for conspiracy, wire fraud and identity theft as part of an effort to spread propaganda through social media sites. ### “Your first request of Vladimir Putin needs to be, tell us which airport we can pick up the 25 Russians that tried to interfere with the fundamentals of our democracy,” Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. said on ""Face the Nation,"" when discussing what he thought Trump's message should be. ### The United States does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, so aides said it's unlikely that the president would seek to get Russia to turn over the intelligence agents indicted last week. “I think it’s pretty silly for the president to demand something that he can’t get legally,’’ National Security Adviser John Bolton said on ABC's This Week . ### Ukraine sanctions ### After Russia moved its military into Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, the United States and other nations instituted a series of economic sanctions against Russia that remain in place over Putin's protests. ### In Brussels last week, Trump signaled that U.S. recognition of Crimea as a Russian territory was not out of the question . He suggested that Russian investments on the peninsula might weigh in Russia's favor. ### ""You know, people like to say, 'Oh, Crimea.' But the fact is, they built bridges to Crimea.  They just opened a big bridge that was started years ago. They built, I think, a submarine port; substantially added billions of dollars,"" Trump said. ### Officials U.S. policy has been that Russia’s armed annexation of the peninsula violated international law and should not be recognized by the rest of the world. European allies are looking for a strong and unequivocal statement that economic sanctions will remain in place until Russia restores the region to Ukrainian control. ### Syria ### For the most part, Putin needs more from the United States than the United States needs from Russia. But one exception may be in Syria, where Russia continues to support the regime of Bashar al-Assad. ### Trump has ordered two airstrikes against Syrian targets since he’s been president, each time careful not to hit Russian assets that could escalate the situation. ### But he has said he would like Russian cooperation – not just to prevent the Syrian government from using chemical weapons and committing other atrocities against its people, but also in combating remaining Islamic State forces in the region. ### Arms control ### For most of the Cold War, U.S.-Russian summits were dominated by the issue of nuclear weapons, with Presidents Nixon, Carter and Reagan reaching a series of incremental agreements to limit the number, size and location of each side’s nuclear arsenal. ### One of those treaties, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, will expire in the next two years. But the United States has accused the Russians of violating it and will seek verifiable commitments before renewing the agreement. ### More: There are nearly 16,000 nuclear weapons in the world — and Russia, U.S. hold more than 90% ### Meanwhile, Trump is pushing NATO allies to vastly increase spending on conventional defense forces in Western and Central Europe, and the alliance has been conducting joint military exercises in Eastern Europe and the Baltic Sea. Russia sees those war games as provocative and would like to see them stop – something else that Trump has not ruled out. ### Personal chemistry ### Trump’s diplomatic style is influenced by his decades of deal-making as much as his briefing books, and personal relationships as much as national interests. ### He's also a practitioner of what might be described as photo-op diplomacy, using flattery, insults, and body language in his international relations toolbox. ### So every gesture – the length and firmness of the handshake, their distance during talks and their every facial expression – will likely be analyzed for clues about the future of U.S.-Russian relations."

10428,hotair.com,2018-07-15T12:39:45-04:00,"Trump’s opportunity at the Putin summit ### Jazz ShawPosted at 12:31 pm on July 15, 2018 ### Share on Facebook ### Share on Twitter ### President Trump is on his way to Helsinki, Finland for his one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The negative media hype over this summit (if we can really consider it a summit when the two leaders have already met twice) is off the charts, but it’s not entirely unwarranted. The opportunities for this to go pear-shaped are many and significant progress is obviously dubious when you’re dealing with someone with Putin’s track record. Still, some of the complaints seem to be a bit more defeatist than is warranted. ### Chuck Schumer wants the entire thing canceled, but nobody is listening to him. CBS, among other outlets, is demanding that Trump face down Putin over the recent election meddling indictments. CNBC is fretting (with good cause) over the possibility that Trump may offer a forgive and forget deal over Ukraine and Crimea. The Washington Post spends a great deal of ink talking about what Putin might have to offer, primarily when it comes to Syria, while simultaneously urging Trump to bail on the meeting anyway because Vlad can’t be trusted to keep his promises. (NARRATOR: Putin can’t be fully trusted in any agreements that don’t benefit Putin.) ### Heck, even President Trump himself said this weekend that he was going into the meeting with “low expectations.” ### Fox News takes a different approach , as you might expect, suggesting that Trump can make a set of demands during the summit which offer Putin the opportunity of a better relationship while simultaneously undermining the perception of America as the common enemy of the Russian people. It’s that perception which helps Putin keep his people loyal. The demands they suggest, however, seem beyond pie in the sky territory. Fox wants Trump to ask Putin to expose all of Moscow’s subversion of American elections, scale back upgrades to their nuclear arsenal and release all government records relating to Russian support of global terror networks. If you ask me, that’s the fastest way to get Putin to stand up and walk out of the meeting. ### But there may be some areas of common interest where we could get something substantial out of Putin without totally handing him the keys to the hen-house. Trump has a few things he could offer which would probably be of interest to Russia. They would drive his critics insane, but that’s their normal state of existence these days anyway and the President doesn’t seem to be overly concerned with the opinions of his detractors. In exchange, Putin has his hands on some levers where we have little or no sway these days. ### The President can’t afford to “endorse” the annexation of Crimea or even the incursions into Ukraine. But he could suggest that he won’t be supporting any further actions such as additional sanctions. As I said, that’s ammunition for Trump’s critics, but it’s not as if anything short of direct military intervention is going to pry Russia out of those areas anyway. Is that a hill we really want to die on? We can condemn Putin’s actions there without turning it into an inferno. ### The indictments of the hackers is pretty much a stalemate. We don’t have an extradition treaty with Russia and Putin’s not going to give them up, so Trump making public demands along those lines simply makes him look powerless. Probably the best the two leaders can get away with is Trump telling Putin he needs to crack down further on future hacking and get Putin to say publicly that he will (while knowing full well that he won’t). ### And what can we get in return? Putin is probably a closer ally to Turkey these days than we are. In fact, forget “probably.” He definitely is. He has a lot of influence with Recep Tayyip Erdogan. With a good push, Putin might at least be able to get a commitment to release Pastor Brunson and the other American hostages. Also, he could pressure Turkey to keep their troops on their side of the Syrian border and not directly attack the American-backed Kurds in northeastern Syria. Turkey wants to make sure they stay in Russia’s good graces, including their pending missile system purchases. It’s a low cost ask for Putin and a potentially significant benefit for the United States. Russia’s actual influence over Iran is more questionable, but he might even be able to push them to scale back their activity in Syria, particularly in the western regions close to Israel. Heck, he might even be able to put a little pressure on Nicolas Maduro to slow the collapse of Venezuela. ### These may sound like small steps mixed with a lot of meaningless diplomatic fluff. That’s because much of it would be. But coming out of the meeting with a few wins and a more open line of communications would still be better than either not going or walking out empty handed. What Donald Trump is actually planning can’t be known since he’s playing this one close to the vest and not even taking his own aides into the meeting. We’ll know soon enough."

As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### What Trump wants ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ""I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,"" Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### President-elect Donald Trump 's refusal to flat out concede that Russia tried to meddle in our election and to accept the findings of the intelligence community makes little policy or political sense. To the contrary, his weird defense of our most formidable geopolitical threat has fueled doubts..."

Add your two cents. ### China Has Been Serving Fried Rice Communism For Years! ### How is the liberal media and special council so obsessed with Russian meddling when China has been in the subversion business for years and makes no secret about it? From Korea to Vietnam, China has had its fingers in every possible pie as it sought to spread communism across the far east. ### We EXPECT China to be an underhanded rouge nation. That’s what it does. So how did Russia take center stage. Slap restrictions on Russia and the price of vodka didn’t even go up. Hit China and the stock market pees on itself. People! We don’t need cheap shoes that bad! ### What makes China click is the fact that the Chinese will make even a bad idea work. Communism failed everywhere it’s ever been. Russia, the herald of Marxism, catapulted the socialist model in 1917. By the end of the century even they cried, “ENOUGH!” and started eating Big Macs. But CHINA! They got MORE communist. Oh, they have their little free market dog and pony show, but they also still have mass executions for whatever reason floats across their little yellow minds. ### So why does such a failed theory work in China? It works because they HAVE no economy. All the Chinese need is a bowl of rice and a pistol and they have a working system. They really don’t have any resources. What? RICE? We HAVE Jonesboro, Arkansas OK? No! China steals. They stole half of Korea, ALL of Vietnam, and tried to rob Bill Gates. Only problem with that little plan was Bill was crookeder than they were. “What you mean ‘Renew honorable subscription.” ### But Mueller’s all over Russia. Don’t you wanna know why? Because Russians are stupid, like us. We both are like dogs in a dog pound. All different breeds. Chinese are like wolves. The look alike, think alike, and subvert everything that doesn’t look like them! Yet not one mention of anything Chinese coming out of Mueller’a mouth, even while he’s in a Chinese restaurant! Don’t you find that a bit odd? ### But the Chinese don’t have to trick us. We GIVE them everything. Hell! We gave them Long Beach! Guess it’ll be renamed Ling Beach now. Trump won the election because middle America was tired of deals like that. The nation couldn’t take right more years. The Trump phenomenon was going to happen. It didn’t matter if it was Donald or his butler running against Hillary. It was time! And no amount of so-called ”collusion” was going to change it. China is the problem. Not Russia. Write that down. There will be a quiz in 2020."

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) ### (Photo: The Associated Press) ### CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE ### WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump faced pressure to aggressively question Russian President Vladimir Putin on meddling by Moscow in the 2016 presidential election when the two leaders meet Monday in Helsinki. ### Trump said Sunday he had “low expectations” for any major breakthroughs. ""Nothing bad is going to come out of it, and maybe some good will come out,"" Trump told CBS News anchor Jeff Glor. ### Trump has had warm words for Putin and has been willing to accept his denials of election meddling at face value. But last week, the Justice Department announced the indictments of 12 Russian agents for hacking into Democratic emails during the campaign. ### Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, called the Russian interference a “serious matter” and said Sunday he was skeptical of Putin's claims that he had no knowledge of it. ### “I find it hard to believe, but that’s what one of the purposes of this meeting is, so the president can see eye-to-eye with President Putin and ask him about it,’’ Bolton told ABC's ""This Week."" ### On ""Face the Nation,"" Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said the details laid out in the indictments – which are part of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller – underscored the importance of confronting Putin. ### “I think the president should be clear-eyed about who he is dealing with,” said Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican. “Putin is an autocrat. He's a thug. He does not respect the rule of law. Obviously, he doesn't respect our democracy and wants to undermine it at every – every chance he gets.” ### Gowdy’s advice to Trump was to press for the extradition of the Russians accused in the latest indictment and of 13 who were charged in an earlier indictment with using social media to interfere in the U.S. election. ### Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., speaks during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee June 28, 2018, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. ### (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) ### “Your first request of Vladimir Putin needs to be, tell us which airport we can pick up the 25 Russians that tried to interfere with the fundamentals of our democracy,” Gowdy said. ### Trump has repeatedly called Mueller’s investigation a “witch hunt.” Over the weekend, he blamed President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee for leaving the Democratic email servers vulnerable to hacking. ### Trump has said he would bring up the election issue, but he suggested he sees little point in doing so since Putin was likely to deny involvement in any meddling. ### He told Glor that he “hadn't thought about” asking Putin for the extradition of the Russian agents, but he said he might bring it up. ### Democrats called on Trump to cancel the meeting with Putin. They expressed alarm at Trump’s decision to lash out at European allies at last week’s NATO summit. NATO was formed as a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### “I'm very concerned about a one-on-one meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump,” said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" He said Trump was not well enough prepared for the meeting. “In Putin, you've got a trained KGB agent who does his homework.” ### Trump went a step further in his criticisms of Europe in the CBS interview, calling the European Union  a “foe” because of what he said was unfairness on trade. ### Trump’s meetings in Helsinki are scheduled to begin at 1:20 p.m. local time (6:20 a.m. EDT). The talks are likely to be followed by a joint news conference."

But he predicted Putin wouldn’t confess. ### “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it, I did it, you got me,”’ Trump said. Referring to a TV courtroom drama aired in the 1950s and 1960s, he added, “There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think, but you never know what happens, right?” ### Trump said he also will discuss the civil war in Syria, Russia’s incursions into Ukraine and nuclear proliferation when he meets with Putin in Helsinki. ### “We’ve been modernizing and fixing and buying” the U.S. nuclear arsenal, Trump said. “It’s just a devastating technology. And they likewise are doing a lot. It’s a very, very bad policy. We have no choice. We are massively big and they are very big.” ### Ahead of the Finland meeting, Trump upended a NATO summit in Brussels this week by demanding that America’s closest allies more rapidly increase their defense spending. He insinuated that the U.S. might withdraw from the alliance otherwise. ### His treatment of U.S. allies has drawn broad criticism from many lawmakers in both parties. Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, called Trump’s NATO remarks “misstatements and bluster” and “the words of one man.” ### He said that in Helsinki, Trump should “reverse his disturbing tendency to show America’s adversaries the deference and esteem that should be reserved for our closest allies.”"

""As the Kremlin said last week, a one-one-one meeting with you 'absolutely suits' him. There must be other Americans in the room."" ### The letter was signed by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who was among those who on Friday called on Trump to cancel the summit, and the top Democrats on the Senate Intelligence, Armed Services, Foreign Relations and other national security-related committees. ### The senators also demanded that Trump press for the extradition of the 12 Russian military intelligence officials indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller on Friday. ### ""These individuals must be brought to the United States so that they can stand trial, and you should demand that Mr. Putin hand them over,"" the senators wrote. ### Speaking to reporters in the United Kingdom on Friday before the indictments became public, Trump pledged to raise the 2016 election meddling issue during his sit-down with Putin. But he has also seemed to suggest that there is not much he can do to push back against the Russian leader's denials. ### ""He (Putin) may deny it,"" Trump said Thursday during the NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium, adding, ""So all I can do is say, 'Did you?' and 'Don't do it again.'"" ### But in a tweet Saturday morning, Trump did not criticize Putin or condemn Russia's actions. ### ""The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration,"" Trump wrote. ""Why didn't they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election?"" ### Later Saturday, Trump continued what has become a familiar refrain from him, repeating his past assertions that former President Barack Obama soft-pedaled actions over Russia's interference in the 2016 election because he thought Hillary Clinton was on a path to winning and did not want to do anything to alter that seemingly likely outcome. ### ""These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Why didn't Obama do something about it? Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, that's why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration, but Fake News doesn't want to report the truth, as usual!"" ### Obama, however, personally warned Putin against messing with the election, imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and entities, kicked out 35 Russian diplomats and closed two of the Kremlin's compounds in the United States. ### In a separate letter sent last Monday, leading foreign-policy Democrats also urged Trump to hold Putin accountable for Russia's destabilization efforts, including election meddling. ### Trump raised the meddling issue during his first meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg last year. But afterward, the US and Russia had different accounts of what was said during the two leaders' more-than-two-hour discussion. Then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump had pressed Putin on the matter, while the Russian foreign minister said Trump had accepted Putin's denials that Russia interfered in the election. ### Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

REUTERS/Reinhard Krause ### More ### By Robin Emmott ### BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Donald Trump's portrayal of NATO as an alliance in crisis has raised concern that the U.S. president's nagging criticism might erode U.S. public support and risk America's commitment to collective defense, diplomats said. ### Allies emerged confused and shaken from a two-day NATO summit in which Trump harangued them over perceived under- spending on defense, accused Germany of being a prisoner to Russian energy and prompted an emergency meeting of leaders trying to contain the fallout from the unexpected tirade at one session. ### NATO diplomats complained that the drama around Trump's forthright comments had overshadowed big decisions that the allies took in areas from defense spending to new weapons and strategies to address Russia's efforts to destabilize the West through cyber and covert attacks. ### ""There was a gap between the Trumpian-generated idea that there is some kind of crisis and the reality that this was one of the most substantial summits for years,"" one senior NATO diplomatic source told Reuters. ### Having questioned the value of NATO in tweets throughout the summit, Trump later told reporters that the 29-member military alliance ""was not doing what they were supposed to be doing"" until he came to Brussels and that he was ""extremely unhappy"" until his intervention. ### Then he claimed ""total credit"" for increases in defense spending, although they were in fact agreed in 2014, and warned that ""NATO is helping Europe more than it is helping us,"" in language that did not make a public case for unity. ### However, the summit also agreed on a new training mission for Iraq, an invitation for Balkan state Macedonia to join NATO and more funding for troops in Afghanistan. ### While Trump did let the 79-point summit declaration go through, his assertion that ""I've taken over a lot of bad hands and I am fixing them,"" at the end of the summit left the impression there were serious problems at NATO, diplomats said. ### NATO may now need its friends in the U.S. Congress and in the Republican and Democratic parties to speak out more to prevent permanent damage to alliance's image in the United States, they said. ### The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly approved a motion in support of NATO on the eve of this week's summit, and former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called for more. ### ""Enough,"" the Democrat said of Trump's style at the summit. ""This isn't good for the United States and there are people across the aisle - as the Senate vote yesterday clearly showed - who know it and need to say it,"" Kerry said on Twitter. ### PERCEPTION, REALITY ### The summit decisions, agreed by all 29 allied governments, won hardly any sustained public attention and the underlying unity was undercut by Trump's claims he had won new pledges in defense spending, forcing the French and Italian leaders into denials that dominated post-summit news conferences. ### He reiterated that claim in Britain on Friday. ### ""The concern is that this is not just noise to disregard, because perception is reality and this president may be with us for another six years,"" the senior source said. ### NATO, founded in 1949 to contain a military threat from the Soviet Union, relies on the United States' military superiority to face down a host of threats on Europe's borders, including a resurgent, nuclear-armed Russia and militant attacks. ### A commitment to defend each other is the bedrock of the alliance and any suggestion that the United States would not come to Europe's aid because, as Trump has suggested, they owe ""massive"" sums, could be a blow to its deterrence. ### ""President Trump has not taken damaging actions against NATO, but his words are damaging,"" said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO and now director of the European Leadership Network think-tank in London. ### Having lambasted NATO for failing to reach a target of 2 percent of national income on defense, Trump told fellow leaders in Brussels he would prefer a goal of 4 percent, similar to U.S. levels, and then claimed victory for forcing countries to move. ### He also said he expected an easier meeting with Russian President Vladimir on Monday in Helsinki in remarks that contrast with the West's accusations that Moscow is seeking to undermine European democracies. ### NO MORE SUMMITS? ### One option aired by diplomats is to scrap regular NATO summits altogether and return to the era of the 1980s, when such leaders-level gatherings were less common and when much of the decision-making was taken by defense and foreign ministers. ### But Thomson said that was not realistic. ""You cannot ignore Trump, he will find a way to make himself heard."" ### Some European officials feel strongly that NATO should be more confident in calling out Trump's mis-statements about the alliance. ### Trump's claims that the United States pays for 90 percent of European security and NATO are incorrect, NATO data shows. ### While U.S. defense spending makes up 70 percent of combined allied governments' military budgets, just 15 percent of U.S. expenditure is spent in Europe on NATO-related defense. ### Washington pays about 22 percent of the running cost of NATO, including the headquarters and commonly-funded equipment such as AWACS surveillance planes. ### Trump has also claimed Germany and others owe money to the United States and NATO, but allied contributions are voluntary and there are multiple budgets. ### At 3.5 percent, the United States' own annual defense spending is below the 4-percent-of-GDP level that Trump has said it is, NATO figures show. ### (Reporting by Robin Emmott; Editing by Richard Balmforth)"

With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ""I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,"" Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### ""The fact that we're having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,"" said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. ""What is important here is that we start a discussion."" ### Trump has been drawn to the spectacle of the summit and has expressed an eagerness to recreate in Helsinki the media show of last month's Singapore summit when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Even as many NATO leaders made supportive noises this week, the Helsinki summit has raised fears in many global capitals that Trump will pull back from traditional Western alliances, allowing Putin to expand his sphere of influence. ### Back home, too, there is wariness on Capitol Hill, with a number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans urging Trump to cancel the summit in the wake of the explosive indictments. ### But Trump has vowed that he can handle Putin, whom he has taken to referring to as a ""competitor"" rather than an adversary. ### And Trump in recent days has outlined some of the items he'd like to discuss, including Ukraine. Though the president has said he was ""not happy"" about Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, he puts the blame on his predecessor and says he will continue relations with Putin even if Moscow refuses to return the peninsula. ### Trump also said he and Putin would discuss the ongoing war in Syria and arms control, negotiations that White House officials have signaled could be fruitful. ### ""I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,"" the president said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. ""We've been modernizing and fixing and buying. And it's just a devastating technology. And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it's a very, very bad policy."" ### But it is the matter of election meddling, including fears Russia could try to interfere in the midterm elections this fall, that could play a central role in the summit talks or loom even larger if not addressed. In neither of Trump's previous meetings with Putin — informal talks on the sidelines of summits last year in Germany and Vietnam — did the president publicly upbraid the Russian leader, prompting questions about whether he believed the former KGB officer's denials over his own intelligence agencies' assessments of meddling. ### Trump repeatedly has cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking of his Democratic rivals and disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise it with Putin even as he downplayed its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### WHAT PUTIN WANTS ### For Putin, sitting down with Trump offers a long-awaited chance to begin repairing relations with Washington after years of spiraling tensions. ### Putin wants the U.S. and its allies to lift sanctions, pull back NATO forces deployed near Russia's borders and restore business as usual with Moscow. In the longer run, he hopes to persuade the U.S. to acknowledge Moscow's influence over its former Soviet neighbors and, more broadly, recognize Russia as a global player whose interests must be taken into account. ### These are long-term goals, and Putin realizes that no significant progress will come from just one meeting. More than anything else, he sees Monday's summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### ""Russia-U.S. ties aren't just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. ""It's unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don't meet."" ### Moscow views Trump's criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump's election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament's upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won't engage in vague talk about ""illusory subjects,"" such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia's return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he's likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be ""pointless"" to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea's status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine's push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### ""Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,"" Lukyanov said. ""But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident."" ### ——— ### Isachenkov reported from Moscow."

A federal grand jury on Friday alleged that officers of Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, secretly monitored computers and stole data from the campaign of Trump’s former rival, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The charges put an even greater spotlight on Trump’s treatment of Putin, who has denied making efforts to intervene in the U.S. election that Trump, a Republican, unexpectedly won. Trump has called the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow a “witch hunt” and has shown an eagerness to get along with his Russian counterpart, repeatedly referring to the former KGB leader’s denials of such behavior."

(AP Photo/Mel Evans) ### The conference of top state election officials she addressed was sandwiched between Friday's indictments of 12 Russian military intelligence officers alleged to have hacked into Democratic party and campaign accounts and Monday's long-awaited meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### Trump has never condemned Russia over meddling in the 2016 election despite the findings of all top U.S. intelligence agencies, and the Kremlin has insisted it didn't meddle in the U.S. election. In the past, Trump has reiterated Putin's denials, but this week he said he would bring up the issue when they meet on Monday in Finland. ### ""All I can do is say, 'Did you?'"" Trump said days ago at a news conference in Brussels. ""And, 'Don't do it again.' But he may deny it."" ### Some of the state officials who run elections say it's important for Trump, a Republican, to take a tougher stance to avoid having the public's confidence in fair elections undermined. ### ""I believe as commander in chief he has an obligation to address it and, frankly, put Putin and any other foreign nation that seeks to undermine our democracy on notice that the actions will not be tolerated,"" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said in an interview this week. ### Some of his peers declined to go that far. ### ""I don't go around telling the president what to do,"" said Jay Ashcroft, the Republican secretary of state in Missouri. ### Trump portrays the investigation as a partisan attack, but not all Republicans see it that way. This month, the Republicans and Democrats on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee backed the findings of an assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election and acted in favor of Trump and against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. ### As part of that effort, Russian hackers targeted at least 21 states ahead of the election and are believed to have breached the voter registration system in at least one, Illinois, investigators say. Without naming the state, Friday's indictment said the Russian intelligence officers stole information on about 500,000 voters from the website of one board of elections, a breach undetected for three weeks. ### There's no evidence results were altered, but the attempts prompted the federal government and states to re-examine election systems and tighten their cybersecurity. ### Federal officials also say it's possible that malware might have been planted that could tamper with voting or paralyze computer systems in future elections. ### The election officials talked about technical details of blocking an incursion. ### Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican, told her peers how her state is using its National Guard to help test and shore up cybersecurity for elections. She said it's important to make it clear to voters that the military is not running elections and does not have access to election data. ### ""The whole idea of this is to instill confidence in voters and the public that the system is secure,"" Wyman said in an interview. ### Some state officials also said Homeland Security is becoming more helpful in sharing information. ### On Friday, a federal grand jury indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers on charges they hacked into Democratic campaign networks in 2016 and then stole and released tens of thousands of documents. The indictment says one of the intrusions came that summer, on a vendor whose software is used to verify voter registration information. The indictment references a spoof email it says the Russian agents sent to more than 100 election-managing customers of the vendor to try to get more information. ### ""The indictments tell us that ... no longer can we deny in any shape or form that Russians were involved,"" said cybersecurity expert Sam Woolley, of the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, California. ### ___ ### Associated Press writer Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report. ### U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen addresses a convention of state secretaries of state, Saturday, July 14, 2018, in Philadelphia.

His latest book is entitled The Official Chuck Norris Fact Book."" Learn more about his life and ministry at his official website, ChuckNorris.com . ### Print ### This Monday, President Donald Trump is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland . As pundits and politicians pontificate and predict who will come out on top at the summit like Las Vegas gamblers for a UFC fight, it made me think back to my fighting days and even Putin’s alleged martial arts mastery. ### A former State Department official who spent decades preparing meetings between U.S. and Russian leaders gave the New Yorker this explanation in comparing the summit competitors: “I’m afraid our guy here is like an amateur boxer going up against Muhammad Ali.” ### What’s fascinating is that mainstream media outlets have done more to elevate Putin’s pre-fight persona before Trump ever steps into the ring with him. Rolling Stone even put a dog in the fight by citing Russia expert and Trump advisor Fiona Hill in her book, “Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin” as “valuable insight into Putin and his leadership of Russia.” RS wrote, “‘Working with people’ [rabotat’s lyud’mi] was a hallmark of the Soviet spy agency under Yuri Andropov, who ran the KGB for much of Putin’s 16-year career there. For a former case officer like Putin, Hill wrote, ‘it meant studying the minds of the targets, finding their vulnerabilities, and figuring out how to use them.'” ### I’m all for assessing the strengths of an opponent – that’s a necessary warfare strategy. But elevating them to some super-status that prompts fear and dread is just plain stupid. Far better is the strategy of how to use an opponent’s strength to overcome him. That’s a tactic I repeatedly used to become a six-time world karate champion. ### The art of jiu-jitsu is to use an opponent’s weight and strength to your advantage. President Trump needs to leverage fear and intimidation (Putin’s strengths) against him. The truth is, Putin needs to fear and respect Trump even to have a good relationship. Trump should never barter or concede friendship with him in absence of fear and respect. ### It’s interesting that, in 2013, several news stories ran with the headings, such as, “ Putin trumps Chuck Norris in black belt stakes ” and “ It’s Official: Vladimir Putin Could Beat Up Chuck Norris… ” ### Apparently, and allegedly – as at least the story goes – while on a visit to South Korea, Putin received a ninth-degree black belt from Choue Chung-won, president of the World Taekwondo Federation, according to Russia’s ITAR-TASS news agency . ### At the time Putin said, “I’m not sure if I deserve this.” Maybe he was being humble, or maybe he was right. Maybe it was more like an honorary degree. ### Though I’m always asked by the press to comment on edgy stories like those involving me, especially when they pit me against intriguing characters like Vladimir Putin, most of the time I don’t comment. I don’t need to. However, I will say this now: it’s one thing to earn the belt, but quite another to use it and win competitions and national championships. Putin has never fought in professional and international competitions. ### Though I’m not one to flash degrees or advancements, I have been truly blessed and honored to earn a 10th-degree black belt in Chun Kuk Do, a 9th-degree black belt in Tang Soo Do, an 8th-degree black belt in Taekwondo, a 5th-degree black belt in Karate, a 3rd-degree black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu from the Machado family, and a black belt in Judo. ### More valuable to me than those self-defense honors, however, I’ve been able to use my martial arts expertise to start my wife, Gena, and my non-profit foundation, KickStart Kids , which seeks to build character in middle school students through karate. ### As far as who would win if I were to step into the ring with Putin? Let me just say this: it would be similar to what would happen if I were to become a politician – something I’m regularly asked to become. The reason I can’t become a congressman, senator, governor, president or any politician is because the second someone disagrees with me, I’ll be tempted to jump over any barrier between us and choke out my opposition! ### Now, that wouldn’t be very nice, would it?"

REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood ### By Saad Sayeed ### ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A week of bombings on political rallies has shattered the relative peace of Pakistan's general election campaign, culminating in a devastating suicide attack that killed at least 130 people at a rally in the southwestern Baluchistan province. ### As campaigning intensifies, attacks in different areas of the country have stoked fear of more violence in the Muslim country of 208 million where political rallies can draw tens of thousands of people. ### The July 25 election features dozens of parties, with two main contenders: ex-cricket hero Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehree-i-Insaf and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, which vows to win a second term despite the jailing of founder, ex-Prime Minster Nawaz Sharif, on a corruption conviction. ### Islamic State claimed responsibility for Friday night's suicide bombing at a rally for the Baluchistan Awami Party (BAP). Among the 130 killed was the party's provincial assembly candidate Siraj Raisani. ### A video clip showed Raisani speaking just before the attack, greeting crowds seated on the ground under a large tent before the blast hit and the image cut off. ### A senior party official said the attack would not dent its election hopes. ### ""It’s a big loss as far as Mr. Raisani is concerned for us ... But will it reverse the course of the political party? No,"" said Anwar ul Haq Kakar, a BAP member of Pakistan's Senate. ### Pakistan's campaign until this week had been relatively peaceful, compared with frequent attacks by the Pakistani Taliban during the 2013 election, which saw 170 people killed, according to statistics from the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies. ### Then, three attacks over four days killed at least 152 people. ### On Tuesday, a Pakistani Taliban suicide bomber blew himself up at a rally by the Awami National Party (ANP) in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing 20 people. ### Among the dead in Peshawar was ANP candidate Haroon Bilour, whose father, senior ANP leader Bashir Bilour, was himself killed in a 2012 suicide bombing in the city. ### And on Friday, another bomb struck the convoy of the religious Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal party (MMA) in the northern town of Bannu, killing four people. ### Although overall violence has ebbed in Pakistan in recent years following an army offensive on militant strongholds in the northwest, both the Pakistani Taliban and Islamic State still launch attacks from across the border in Afghanistan. ### Pakistan's army will deploy about 371,000 troops on election day, almost three times the number in 2013, to protect the polling places. ### (Writing by Kay Johnson; Editing by Mark Potter)"
11019,newsmax.com,2018-07-15T11:32:39-04:00,"A   A ###  ### President Donald Trump’s upcoming sit-down with Vladimir Putin will try to take “some of the danger” out of relations between Washington and Moscow, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman said Sunday. ### In an interview on NBC News’ “Meet The Press,” Huntsman said “It isn’t a summit. It’s a meeting.” ### “No state dinner, no joint statement, no deliverables that are going to be pre-packaged,” he said of the meeting. “You don't know what's going to come out of this meeting, but what it will be is the first opportunity for these presidents to actually sit down across a table, alone, and then with their teams, to talk about everything from meddling in the election, to areas where we have some shared interests.” ### It’s “inconceivable that we can solve some of the international issues without engaging Russia at some level,” he said. ### “Right now, there's no trust in the relationship, and because of that, problem solving is practically impossible,” he said. “So, this is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama, and quite frankly some of the danger, out of the relationship right now.” ### Huntsman also said the FBI and embassy ""will work on"" trying to extradite 12 Russian intel officers who’ve been indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for hacking into Democratic email servers prior to the 2016 election. ### “Requests can be made. That doesn't necessarily mean that the Russians are going to follow through with it,” he said. “But we'll see if those steps will be taken.” ### Huntsman also said he doubts there’ll be any changes in Crimea as a result of the meeting. ### “The agenda is the president's. Everything will be his call, but I think it's highly unlikely that you'll see any change in Crimea,” he said. ### In a separate interview with “Fox News Sunday,” he added: ""Crimea was a violation of international law. We all recognize that. That’s U.S. policy,. “These are very, very serious issues and issues we have serious sanctions tied to by the way."" ### Related Stories:"

With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ""I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,"" Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### ""The fact that we're having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,"" said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. ""What is important here is that we start a discussion."" ### Trump has been drawn to the spectacle of the summit and has expressed an eagerness to recreate in Helsinki the media show of last month's Singapore summit when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Even as many NATO leaders made supportive noises this week, the Helsinki summit has raised fears in many global capitals that Trump will pull back from traditional Western alliances, allowing Putin to expand his sphere of influence. ### Back home, too, there is wariness on Capitol Hill, with a number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans urging Trump to cancel the summit in the wake of the explosive indictments. ### But Trump has vowed that he can handle Putin, whom he has taken to referring to as a ""competitor"" rather than an adversary. ### And Trump in recent days has outlined some of the items he'd like to discuss, including Ukraine. Though the president has said he was ""not happy"" about Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, he puts the blame on his predecessor and says he will continue relations with Putin even if Moscow refuses to return the peninsula. ### Trump also said he and Putin would discuss the ongoing war in Syria and arms control, negotiations that White House officials have signaled could be fruitful. ### ""I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,"" the president said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. ""We've been modernizing and fixing and buying.  And it's just a devastating technology.  And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it's a very, very bad policy."" ### But it is the matter of election meddling, including fears Russia could try to interfere in the midterm elections this fall, that could play a central role in the summit talks or loom even larger if not addressed. In neither of Trump's previous meetings with Putin — informal talks on the sidelines of summits last year in Germany and Vietnam — did the president publicly upbraid the Russian leader, prompting questions about whether he believed the former KGB officer's denials over his own intelligence agencies' assessments of meddling. ### Trump repeatedly has cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking of his Democratic rivals and disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise it with Putin even as he downplayed its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think.  But you never know what happens, right?  But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### WHAT PUTIN WANTS ### For Putin, sitting down with Trump offers a long-awaited chance to begin repairing relations with Washington after years of spiraling tensions. ### Putin wants the U.S. and its allies to lift sanctions, pull back NATO forces deployed near Russia's borders and restore business as usual with Moscow. In the longer run, he hopes to persuade the U.S. to acknowledge Moscow's influence over its former Soviet neighbors and, more broadly, recognize Russia as a global player whose interests must be taken into account. ### These are long-term goals, and Putin realizes that no significant progress will come from just one meeting. More than anything else, he sees Monday's summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### ""Russia-U.S. ties aren't just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. ""It's unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don't meet."" ### Moscow views Trump's criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump's election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament's upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won't engage in vague talk about ""illusory subjects,"" such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia's return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he's likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be ""pointless"" to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea's status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine's push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### ""Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,"" Lukyanov said. ""But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident."" ### ___"

More than anything else, he sees Monday's summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### ""Russia-U.S. ties aren't just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. ""It's unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don't meet."" ### Moscow views Trump's criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump's election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament's upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won't engage in vague talk about ""illusory subjects,"" such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia's return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he's likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be ""pointless"" to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea's status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine's push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### ""Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,"" Lukyanov said. ""But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident."""

A host of other thorny issues ranging from Crimea to Syria to election meddling are also expected to come up. ### The presidential palace in Helsinki is the site of the historic talks                    (Lehtikuva) ### The two are expected to hold a press conference later Monday. ### “I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship,” Trump said, sitting next to Putin at the presidential palace in Helsinki. “Getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.” ### Putin and Trump meet in 2017 during the G-20 gathering                    (AP) ### The president sat down with Putin after sparring for the better part of the past week with traditional U.S. allies -- first with NATO nations over their levels of defense spending, and later with British Prime Minister Theresa May over her 'Brexit' strategy, though he seemed to patch things up before leaving London. The tensions created a contrast with his efforts to improve ties with Moscow, leading to bipartisan concerns about Monday's summit. ### Back home, Democrats and some Republicans called for Trump to cancel the summit after the Department of Justice announced the indictments of a dozen Russian intelligence operatives for allegedly hacking Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Putin has previously told Trump Russia did not meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ### ""Certainly I'll be asking about it,"" Trump told CBS News on Saturday. ### Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, during a phone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, urged Trump to press the issue, saying: ""For President Trump to meet with President Putin without expressing the outrage of the American people and securing real progress would be terrible for the United States and the security of our election system."" ### Trump arrived in Finland's capital a day early, while the jet carrying Putin, who wrapped up his nation’s hosting of the World Cup Sunday, touched down around 1 p.m. local time and the Russian president’s motorcade whisked him straight to the neo-classical palace a dozen miles from the airport. ### Election meddling by Moscow, the annexation of Crimea and Russia’s involvement in Syria are all expected to come up in the first one-on-one talks between the nations' leaders since 2010. ### Facing pressure to get tough on Putin, Trump on Monday blamed past U.S. policies for soured relations. ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" he tweeted. ### On Sunday, Trump  sought to lower expectations for any major breakthrough. ### Heading to Helsinki, Finland – looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia... ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 15, 2018 ### “… no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” Trump tweeted. ### While the election hacking issue was thrust into the spotlight on the eve of the summit, other issues awaited the leaders. ### Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman said Trump was ""highly unlikely"" to recognize Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea, but refused to rule out the possibility. ### Trump himself has been noncommittal on the issue, saying Friday during a press conference with British Prime Minister Teresa May that “we're going to see what happens"" at the Helsinki summit. ### The president claimed ahead of his summit with Putin that the Russian president would not have invaded Crimea had he been in office, calling the globally condemned annexation an “Obama disaster.” ### Putin has signaled he would like Trump to soften sanctions that Washington imposed over the annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, involvement in the Syrian civil war and allegations of Russian meddling. ### Trump signed an August 2017 law imposing additional sanctions on Russia. The law bars Trump from easing many sanctions without Congress’ approval, but he can offer some relief without a nod from Congress. ### Almost 700 Russian people and companies are under U.S. sanctions. Individuals face limits on their travel and freezes on at least some of their assets, while some top Russian state banks and companies, including oil and gas giants, are effectively barred from getting financing through U.S. banks and markets. ### The two leaders also are expected to discuss a tentative deal to move Iranian troops farther from Israel's border with Syria and Jordan, in exchange for allowing access there to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. ### U.S. officials have worried about the danger of new conflict in Syria between Israel and Iran or Iran-backed forces. The White House also seeks increased Russian oil production—a move on which Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have already agreed—to restrict Iranian export earnings. ### A National Security Council official told Fox News that Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend to prepare for the Putin meeting. ### ""Yesterday I spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump,"" Netanyahu said in Israel on Sunday. ""We discussed security and diplomatic issues arising from regional developments, chief most among them, of course, Syria and Iran. ### ""I thanked President Trump for his tough policy against Iran because since this policy has been taken, we have seen a great effect on Iran and inside Iran,"" he added. ""President Trump reiterated with sharp clarity his commitment to the security of Israel and his willingness to help Israel in various realms and, of course, I thanked him for that.'' ### Putting constraints on Iran could be the top Helsinki priority of Trump and his advisers. U.S. and Russian officials have agreed on a tentative proposal that would keep Iranian forces in Syria 27 miles from Israeli border. ### Fox News' Gregg Re and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were sickened by a military-grade nerve agent on March 4. ### According to an unnamed former American official, U.K. investigators believe they are close to identifying the agents involved, admitting it could have been other Russian intelligence agencies responsible for the attack. ### The news comes as President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin gear up for their summit in Helsinki on Monday. On Friday, the Justice Department announced indictments for 12 G.R.U. officers claiming they were responsible for hacking into Democratic National Committee communications and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. ### Analysts and government officials maintain the G.R.U. has been involved in conflicts around the world, including Russia's war in Ukraine, the 2014 annexation of Crimea and supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The strike force is also known for creating political turmoil in other countries, including the funding of protests. ### Skripal had worked in the G.R.U. for about 15 years while also working as an informant in the U.K. He was arrested in 2004 and pleaded guilty to espionage, serving six years of a 13-year sentence before his release in 2010 as part of a spy swap. ### Skripal's daughter was visiting him from Russia at the time of the attack. Both have healed since the incident and are living in hiding. ### The Times noted that poisonings were generally a tool used by the Kremlin on traitors. Russian officials have denied any involvement in the nerve agent attack against the Skripals. ### Putin spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov on Sunday denied the G.R.U. was at fault, saying, ""Russia is in no way involved in this episode . . . We consider this whole thing a major provocation."" ### And, the attack may not have been conducted by a Russian government agency, as later years have seen a desire by the Kremlin to create hybrid operations, making it less likely to be traced to the Russian government. ### ""Our country has come to the understanding that the government should not be committing crimes,"" said Dmitri A. Muratov, director of the editorial board at Novaya Gazeta, an independent newspaper. Hybrid operations, he said, ""are close to the government but not of the government."" ### Earlier this summer, two more British citizens became critically ill after being exposed to the same nerve agent. One of the victims died on July 8 . U.K. police said the latest victims were exposed to the same nerve agent that sickened the Skripals earlier in the year. ### The situation has caused a strain on relations between the U.K. and Russia, according to the Times. In April, Britain, the U.S. and other allies expelled 150 Russian diplomats in protest of the poisoning. Russia responded in like manner expelling a number of foreign diplomats. ### Related Stories:"

11491,breitbart.com,2018-07-15T07:29:28-04:00,"What Trump and Putin hope to achieve at Helsinki summit ### The Associated Press ### 15 Jul 2018 ### HELSINKI (AP) — The outcome of the first summit between the unpredictable first-term American president and Russia’s steely-eyed longtime leader is anybody’s guess. With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday’s meeting in Helsinki, here’s a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### “I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,” Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### “The fact that we’re having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,” said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. “What is important here is that we start a discussion.” ### Trump has been drawn to the spectacle of the summit and has expressed an eagerness to recreate in Helsinki the media show of last month’s Singapore summit when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Even as many NATO leaders made supportive noises this week, the Helsinki summit has raised fears in many global capitals that Trump will pull back from traditional Western alliances, allowing Putin to expand his sphere of influence. ### Back home, too, there is wariness on Capitol Hill, with a number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans urging Trump to cancel the summit in the wake of the explosive indictments. ### But Trump has vowed that he can handle Putin, whom he has taken to referring to as a “competitor” rather than an adversary. ### And Trump in recent days has outlined some of the items he’d like to discuss, including Ukraine. Though the president has said he was “not happy” about Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, he puts the blame on his predecessor and says he will continue relations with Putin even if Moscow refuses to return the peninsula. ### Trump also said he and Putin would discuss the ongoing war in Syria and arms control, negotiations that White House officials have signaled could be fruitful. ### “I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,” the president said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. “We’ve been modernizing and fixing and buying.  And it’s just a devastating technology.  And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it’s a very, very bad policy.” ### But it is the matter of election meddling, including fears Russia could try to interfere in the midterm elections this fall, that could play a central role in the summit talks or loom even larger if not addressed. In neither of Trump’s previous meetings with Putin — informal talks on the sidelines of summits last year in Germany and Vietnam — did the president publicly upbraid the Russian leader, prompting questions about whether he believed the former KGB officer’s denials over his own intelligence agencies’ assessments of meddling. ### Trump repeatedly has cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking of his Democratic rivals and disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a “witch hunt.” But he said in Britain that he would raise it with Putin even as he downplayed its impact. ### “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'” Trump said, invoking a television detective. “There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think.  But you never know what happens, right?  But I will absolutely firmly ask the question.” ### WHAT PUTIN WANTS ### For Putin, sitting down with Trump offers a long-awaited chance to begin repairing relations with Washington after years of spiraling tensions. ### Putin wants the U.S. and its allies to lift sanctions, pull back NATO forces deployed near Russia’s borders and restore business as usual with Moscow. In the longer run, he hopes to persuade the U.S. to acknowledge Moscow’s influence over its former Soviet neighbors and, more broadly, recognize Russia as a global player whose interests must be taken into account. ### These are long-term goals, and Putin realizes that no significant progress will come from just one meeting. More than anything else, he sees Monday’s summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### “Russia-U.S. ties aren’t just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. “It’s unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don’t meet.” ### Moscow views Trump’s criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump’s election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament’s upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won’t engage in vague talk about “illusory subjects,” such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia’s return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he’s likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be “pointless” to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea’s status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine’s push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### “Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,” Lukyanov said. “But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident.” ### ___"

Speaking through a translator, the Russian leader said “the time has come to have a thorough discussion on various international problems and sensitive issues.” ### The summit got under way hours after Trump blamed the United States, and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea, for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow’s aggression may go unchallenged. ### “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,” Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming “many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” ### The summit, which was being closely monitored by rattled world capitals, was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump’s presidential campaign. Undeterred, the American president was set to go face to face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian’s leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British Queen, among many others. ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn’t “expect anything” from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn’t looking for any “concrete deliverables.” Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland’s president that he thought the summit would go “fine.” ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. They shared a brief handshake before reporters were ushered out so they could begin their one-on-one talks in the palace’s opulent Gothic Hall. ### They’ll continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor’s throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a “witch hunt.” ### Associated Press writers Zeke miller, Ken Thomas and Darlene Superville contributed to this report. ### Follow the Bangor Daily News on Facebook for the latest Maine news. ### Most Popular"

But hours before he was due to meet the Russian president, Trump focused his ire on his own country and the investigation into possible links between his 2016 campaign and Russia. The president has denied any collusion took place. ### “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” wrote Trump on Twitter, referring to the investigation into possible collusion. ### Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt! ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018 ### During a breakfast meeting with Finland’s president before the meeting with Putin in the Finnish capital, Trump appeared upbeat. Asked what he would say to Putin, Trump said: “We’ll do just fine, thank you.” ### Trump and his wife Melania returned to their hotel after the breakfast and were expected to remain there for a few hours before the afternoon summit. Putin was due in Helsinki around lunch time. ### The two leaders will first meet one-on-one with only their interpreters, followed by a working lunch accompanied by advisers, and a joint news conference. ### While Trump has been abroad since last week, the special prosecutor investigating allegations that Russia interfered to help him win the 2016 presidential election indicted 12 Russians on Friday for stealing Democratic Party documents. ### Trump’s foes at home have been scathing about his apparent refusal to criticize Putin. His 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton tweeted: “Great World Cup. Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?” ### Great World Cup. Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for? ### — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 16, 2018 ### Neither side expects major breakthroughs from the talks and the outcome is uncertain given sharp differences between Washington and Moscow over everything from Syria to Ukraine. ### For Putin, the fact that the summit is even happening despite Russia’s semi-pariah status among some Americans and U.S. allies is a geopolitical win because, in Russian eyes, it shows that Washington recognizes Moscow as a great power that cannot be isolated or ignored. ### The Kremlin made clear beforehand it did not expect an easy meeting, taking Trump to task over his criticism of a planned Russian gas pipeline to Germany and suggesting it would be hard to find common ground on Syria because of differences over Iran. ### FIRST STEP ### Russia hoped however that the summit would be “the first step” in overcoming a crisis in relations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia’s RT TV station. “Presidents Trump and Putin respect each other and they get along well. There is no clear agenda. It will be determined by the heads of state themselves as they go along.” ### Trump wants Russia to help Moscow to use its influence in Syria, where it is backing President Bashar al-Assad militarily, to push Iranian and Iranian-allied forces out. ### “Of course Syria will be discussed by the two presidents,” said Peskov. “We all know what Washington thinks of Iran. But at the same time Iran is a good partner to us in terms of trade, economic cooperation and political dialogue. So this will not be an easy exchange of views.” ### Trump has predicted he will be accused of being too soft on Putin no matter how the summit goes. ### “If I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia...I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!” he tweeted on Sunday. ### He has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling, but does not expect to get anywhere. ### Beyond warm words, the summit could yield an agreement to begin repairing battered U.S.-Russia relations, and maybe a deal to start talks on issues such as nuclear arms control and Syria. ### The Helsinki summit is the capstone to a nearly week-long trip for Trump during which he has sown doubts about his commitment to the NATO military alliance, Washington’s so-called special relationship with Britain and U.S. relations with the European Union that he called “a foe” on trade. ### RELATED..."

He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea's status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine's push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### ""Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,"" Lukyanov said. ""But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident."" ### ___"

The arguments feed the Kremlin narrative that democracy is dangerous unless it is carefully ""managed."" ### Russian commentators and editorialists who consider the European Union hostile, troublesome or irrelevant welcomed Trump's criticism of longtime European allies as ""foes"" to the U.S. ### Russia's state-run Channel One said Trump's meetings in Britain and contentious appearance at the NATO summit last week were secondary to Monday's summit, saying: ""After all, he was just passing through Brussels and London on the way to Helsinki."" ### Konstantin Kosachev, head of the upper house of parliament's foreign affairs committee, wrote in Izvestia that Monday's talks come at a time when ""so-called 'peace-loving' Europe is afraid of peace talks between U.S. and Russia."" ### Russian media did have rather tempered expectations of how much Putin can concretely get from the summit, but hoped for progress on solutions for Syria and Mideast tensions. ### Heading into the summit, Trump denounced the American news media as the ""enemy of the people,"" despite constitutional protections for freedom of the press. ### The Russian media scene is a different beast. Under Putin, the government has assumed control or sway over most broadcasters and mainstream media and put pressure on critical reporting online. Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some outspoken Russian journalists. ### A protest sign for the summit posted on a Helsinki bus stop Monday read ""Unpleasant things will happen to Journalists who ask Putin questions."" ### Despite clear interest in Russia in Putin's meeting with Trump, the summit wasn't the No. 1 item on many Russian newscasts or websites Monday: That honor went to the World Cup, and Russia's own global image. ### Close"

Instead of making the U.S. Supreme Court less political, his proposal to elect justices would make it more political than ever.  Elections are messy and just as unpredictable as appointments; just look at President Donald Trump's election. Further, good justices would not necessarily be elected. For example, I doubt Carter's mentor, Justice Thurgood Marshall, could have been elected at the time he was nominated by President Lyndon Johnson . The drafters of the Constitution wisely choose a very good method for the selection of justices, even if it doesn’t work as well as originally planned. ### A more reasonable solution to the political problem of the Supreme Court would be to have each new justice pledge when nominated to retire at a set age or after serving a set term of, say, 12 or 15 years. This would, I hope, put them in between election cycles. Also, this would end justices serving into advanced ages, because they fear the replacement the president in power would choose for their positions. ### — William Dasso, Arlington Heights"

""I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship."" ### Trump arrived Monday afternoon at the Finnish presidential palace for what he has called a summit with Putin, hoping once again that his personal touch can reverse the steep decline in U.S.-Russia relations in recent years. ### U.S. officials have stressed the path to improving U.S.-Russia ties runs through a clear-eyed understanding of Russian aggression and the root causes of discord in the relationship, but Trump is signaling a different course. He is holding previous U.S. administrations and the Justice Department's investigation stemming from Russian meddling in the 2016 election responsible. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" Trump tweeted Monday morning ahead of the summit. ### twitter/@realDonaldTrump via CNN ### Trump and Putin arrived separately at the Finnish presidential palace, about 45 minutes behind schedule. Trump held at his hotel while he waited for Putin, who is known for arriving late to important events, to touch down -- drawing comparisons to Trump's late arrivals at recent summits with U.S. allies. ### They then walked into a room at the presidential palace together before offering brief remarks before a gaggle of cameras and reporters, with Trump congratulating Putin once again ""on a really great World Cup."" ### The two men shook hands after speaking before reporters were ushered out. ### For the next hour-and-a-half, Trump and Putin are scheduled to hold one-on-one discussions, with only interpreters at their side. ### Trump was eager to have time alone with Putin to better personally assess him and develop a personal relationship, according to a U.S. official, but he has also expressed anger at leaks from his meetings with foreign leaders and told aides he wanted to ensure his sensitive discussions with Putin remained secret. ### The official also said that Trump doesn't want aides -- who may take a harder line on Russia -- undercutting or interrupting him during his talks with Putin. ### Just days earlier, Trump pointed to the ""pure stupidity"" and a ""political problem"" in the United States for making it ""very hard to do something with Russia."" ### ""Anything you do, it's always going to be, 'Oh, Russia, he loves Russia,' "" Trump said during a joint news conference with his British counterpart. ### Trump's Monday morning tweet and his words and actions in the last week have only amplified concerns about his approach to Russia among U.S. allies and lawmakers of both parties in Washington. ### During his swing through Brussels and the United Kingdom, Trump has repeatedly criticized U.S. allies, called the European Union a ""foe"" and criticized the Obama administration rather than Russia in the wake of the Justice Department's indictment of 12 Russian agents who allegedly worked to hack Democrats' emails and computer networks during the 2016 election. ### Ahead of his meeting with Putin -- who is alleged to be behind the assassination of journalists and political dissidents -- the US President also lashed out again at the news media on Sunday by branding journalists ""the enemy of the people."" ### Trump again -- as he has repeatedly done -- pointed the finger at his predecessor President Barack Obama and characterized the investigation stemming from Russian election interference as a ""witch hunt."" ### ""President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it,"" Trump tweeted. ""When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!"" ### Everything from Russian meddling in the 2016 election to the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine are expected to be on the agenda for their summit here in Helsinki, but Trump has signaled he is most eager to jumpstart talks to ""substantially reduce"" the two countries' nuclear weapons arsenals and generally improve U.S.-Russia relations. ### Trump is not, however, expected to offer to halt military exercises in the Baltics as part of his discussions with Putin, with a U.S. official telling CNN's Jeff Zeleny ""at least that's the plan going in."" ### The question of the Baltics exercises has hung over the summit, particularly after Trump abruptly decided last month to agree to stop joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises during his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Trump has said he intends to once again ask Putin about Russian efforts to sway the results of the 2016 election but has signaled he will not press the issue. ### ""I know you'll ask, will we be talking about meddling. I will absolutely bring that up. I don't think you'll have any, 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.' There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think, but you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely, firmly ask the question,"" Trump said. ### Trump has sought to cool expectations in the last days leading up to the summit, saying in an interview Saturday that he planned to arrive in Helsinki ""with very low expectations."" ### ""I think that getting along with Russia is a good thing, but it's possible we won't,"" Trump said. ### Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

The Russian witch hunt. The rigged situation,"" said Mr. Trump in an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Jeff Glor at his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland on Saturday. ### Ukraine, Crimea and sanctions ### Leading up to the meeting with Putin, Mr. Trump has also been asked about Crimea. In response, he has blamed President Obama for allowing Putin to annex Crimea from Ukraine during his administration in 2014. Putin, Mr. Trump said at a news conference with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May last week that Obama ""failed very badly with Crimea - I wouldn't have done that."" ""We'll have to see what happens,"" he added. ### At the time, Mr. Obama condemned the move, and the U.S. and E.U. sanctioned Russia afterward. Even now, only countries like Venezuela and Syria recognize Crimea as part of Russia. In May, Russia bolstered its relationship with Crimea with the completed construction of a bridge from Russia to Crimea. ### While Ukraine and some European allies fear that Mr. Trump will recognize the annexation of Crimea, National Security Adviser told ABC News' ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos,"" ""That is not the policy of the U.S."" The U.S. ambassador to Russia, Jon Huntsman was also asked about Crimea Sunday. ""I think it's highly unlikely that that will come up in their conversation,"" he told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" adding that there are ""so many other things to talk about."" ### And at this point, U.S. sanctions against Russia over the annexation still remain in place, many of them dating back to the Obama administration in 2014. Russia has also been sanctioned by the U.S. over election meddling and other cyber attacks like NotPetya , which the U.S. and U.K. believe the Russian military executed, and which cost billions in damage across Europe, Asia and the U.S. ### Syria and Iran ### A centerpiece of the Helsinki summit will be the future of Syria and a proposal to enlist Russia as a partner in ousting Iran from that battlefield. ### Recently, on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" National Security Adviser Ambassador John Bolton signaled to CBS News' Margaret Brennan that the U.S. has dropped its rhetorical opposition to dictator Bashar al Assad , who has held onto power in Syria through a mix of brutal tactics such as chemical weapon s, and the firepower of Russian and Iranian forces, including Hezbollah. ### ""I don't think Assad is the strategic issue. I think Iran is the strategic issue,"" Bolton said. As Brennan has reported, the Trump administration has accepted that Assad will remain in power for the immediate future and has decided to focus on convincing Putin to sever ties with his battlefield partner Iran. ### It's not clear that Russia has the leverage or ability to push out Iran, which has served as Assad's main patron through the war, now in its seventh year. The U.S. does have its own leverage through a limited military presence of about 2,000 troops on the ground in Syria to assist local forces in the fight against ISIS .  But Mr. Trump has said he doesn't want to keep those troops in Syria. ### There are concerns about brokering another deal with Russia on Syria, since Putin is already currently violating the 2017 agreement that he personally brokered with Trump to halt attacks inside a so-called de--escalation zone in southern Syria. ### Trump tweets on meeting's success ahead of meeting ### On Sunday before arriving in Helsinki, Mr. Trump tweeted that he looked forward to meeting with Putin but that no matter how successful it was, he predicted the news media would paint it as a failure. ### Heading to Helsinki, Finland - looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia... ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 15, 2018 ### ""No matter how well I do at the summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough -- that i should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition,"" he tweeted. ### Trump claims NATO members ""thanked"" him for Putin meeting ### Ahead of Monday's meeting, Mr. Trump told reporters in Brussels that allied nations have expressed ""the opposite of concern"" over his summit with Putin and in fact thanked him for arranging it. ### ""They actually and they'll probably come out with a little bit of an edict. They actually thanked me for meeting. They thanked me for doing it and they gave us their best wishes. We'll see what happens. It's just a loose meeting. It's not a big schedule. It's not going to take a long time. And we'll see where it leads but it could lead to something very productive,"" Mr. Trump said on Thursday. ### Congressional concerns ### Lawmakers have expressed serious concerns with the president's meeting since the announcement of the summit, particularly as it relates to the U.S. election system's integrity heading into the 2018 midterm elections. ### Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer warned in a joint statement last week that if Mr. Trump leaves the summit with Putin without ""ironclad assurances"" from Russia that they won't carry out similar attacks on the U.S. election system,  ""this meeting will not only be a failure - it will be a grave step backward for the future of the international order and global security."" ### ""The president needs to remember that, as Commander-in-Chief, his duty is to protect the American people from foreign threats, not to sell out our democracy to Putin,"" they added. ### Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, said that the summit was not a surprise as Mr. Trump has a ""disturbing affinity for authoritarian figures."" He added that the president should use the meeting to confront Putin on Russian interference in the U.S. elections but worries it will instead end up being a ""gift to the Kremlin."" ### Republican and frequent Trump critic Sen. John McCain cast doubt that the summit should even move forward in light of the new indictments. ### President Trump must be willing to confront #Putin from a position of strength & demonstrate there will be a price to pay for his ongoing aggression.

Jeff Flake of Arizona echoed that sentiment, tweeting that the indictments reaffirm that ""election interference is not a question to be asked of Vladimir Putin, but a statement to be made to Vladimir Putin: You interfered in our elections."" ### Will Trump raise Russian meddling in 2016? ### All eyes are on Mr. Trump to see if he will press Putin on Russia's involvement in the 2016 presidential election. National Security Adviser John Bolton told reporters in Moscow late last month that he ""expects it will be a subject of conversation between the two presidents."" ### Mr. Trump confirmed to reporters in Brussels during the NATO summit that he would in fact be asking about meddling during their meeting. Asked what he would do if the Russians denied such meddling, Mr. Trump replied: ""He [Putin] may."" ### ""He may deny it. It's one of those things. All I can say is, did you? And don't do it again. But he may deny. You'll be the first to know, okay."" ### The Kremlin, however, has repeatedly reiterated its denial of any interference with the election. ""It was stated clearly by our side that the Russian state hasn't interfered with the U.S. domestic politics , moreover hasn't interfered in the 2016 election ,"" Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said at a press conference last month after the U.S. and Moscow laid groundwork for the Helsinki meeting. ### ""The Russian state has never interfered and has no intention of interfering in U.S. elections,"" insisted Putin's foreign affairs adviser again on Friday, hours before Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the indictment s. ### Asked about the possibility of extraditing the Russians indicted in the DOJ's charges, Mr. Trump told Glor over the weekend, ""I might."" ### What's on the schedule? ### A senior U.S. official told CBS New s that the two leaders will have extended one-on-one meeting, which has heightened concern among some U.S. officials regarding any concessions that may be made when the two are in the room together. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the Russian government-funded network RT that it was the U.S. that requested that the Trump-Putin meeting take place without aides in the room. ### According to top advisers of the president, Mr. Trump's private one-on-one meeting with Putin is scheduled to last about half-an-hour but could go even longer than that. Putin has met with three previous U.S. presidents before Mr. Trump, but never has there been a private session of this magnitude. ### Afterward, Putin and Mr. Trump are also expected to take part in an expanded bilateral meeting that includes their top advisers, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly and National Security Adviser John Bolton. ### The two leaders will also be holding a joint press conference after the meetings. ### Russian aides also say that Putin and Mr. Trump may adopt a joint statement on international security issues, including ""improving bilateral relations, both in terms of joint actions in the international arena and in terms of ensuring international stability and security."""

Our response must not depend on who was victimized.” ### The charges add to an already substantial list of 19 other people and three companies charged in the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. ### Collectively, the other defendants face more than 75 criminal charges, including lying to the F.B.I., bank fraud and conspiracy against the United States government. Among those charged include former national security advisor Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates and former campaign foreign policy advisor, George Papadopoulos . ### Five of those charged, including Gates, Flynn and Papadopoulos, have pleaded guilty. ### Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan was the first defendant to be sentenced after pleading guilty for lying to investigators. Manafort awaits trial in an Alexandria, Virginia jail cell after his bail was revoked for alleged witness tampering. ### Trump, who is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin after he finishes a trip to Great Britain, has been critical of Mueller and Rosenstein since the probe began. He regularly calls the investigation a “Witch Hunt” and has called both Mueller and Rosenstein “conflicted.” ### Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!"

We don't put them in cages,"" said Peter Vesterbacka, one of the creators of the Angry Birds video game, referring to the Trump administration's controversial policy of separating undocumented immigrant children from their parents at the US-Mexico border. ### Sofi Oksanen, author of the internationally acclaimed novel ""Purge"", is expected to read at the rally texts by the Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who is jailed in Russia and has been on hunger strike since mid-May. ### The protest hopes to attract 15,000 people, but as of Friday only a fraction of that had declared they would attend the event on Facebook. ### Mass demonstrations are relatively uncommon in Finland although the Gay Pride parade last month broke an all-time record with 100,000 participants. As it is the summer holidays, a large turnout at the anti-Trump and anti-Putin protests is not expected. ### The youth group of the right-wing National Coalition Party said it would take to the streets but only expected a modest number of ""between 20 and 30"" participants. ### ""To President Trump we are saying: 'Make America Trade Again', for free trade, against trade war.

12039,buzzfeed.com,2018-07-15T22:23:52-04:00,"Opinion ### Trump And Putin Lead The Global Illiberal Block. Who Will Lead The Resistance? ### A global cultural and political fault line runs through the US, Russia, and Europe — with Trump and Putin on the same side of the divide. ### Posted on ### Pin ### As Donald Trump prepares to meet with Vladimir Putin, many onlookers view the two leaders and their countries through a geopolitical lens that is essentially two dimensional — a map with imperial borders that shift as great powers rise and fall. And the US, with its morally corrupt and vulnerable leader falling under Putin’s spell, is a power in decline, they say. ### What they’re missing though this outdated worldview is is a third dimension, in which a global cultural and political fault line is cutting through the US, Russia, and most of the EU — with Trump and Putin on the same side of the divide. The two leaders represent the same strain of a rising global culture: that of viciously xenophobic tabloids, politically biased infotainment TV, tacky showbiz, irresponsible populism, rabid nativism and oligarchic kleptocracy. ### You may not see that if you visualize Russia as a cross between Tolkien’s Mordor and the Star Wars Empire, rather than the fairly modernized and easily travellable nation of quality coffee shops, craft beer and hipster-ridden gentrified industrial sites experienced and genuinely admired by World Cup fans in recent weeks. ### You also also have trouble seeing that if you don’t understand how Putin governs Russia: through TV channels modeled on Silvio Berlusconi’s infotainment TV and Fox News (or even launched by former Fox staff , as in the case of the rabidly imperialist Tsargrad TV channel) and vicious tabloids that look and sound exactly like the Sun and Daily Mirror. Then there’s the militant Christian fundamentalism, copycatted down to the minor details from the US evangelical right, and the massive trolling of the notions of tolerance and human rights — a practice imported wholesale from the European far-right, notably France’s National Front. ### But if you mingle with the Trump and Putin crowds — or, as in my case, interviewed each of their supporters during election campaigns — you’re struck by the cultural similarity. These two groups share more in common with each other than they do with their compatriots on the other side of the divide: their view of politics as a form entertainment, their vulnerability to obvious fakes and outsized confirmation bias, their outlandish ideas about the workings of outside world, their cult of imaginary past and fear of cultural or racial otherness. Such traits are almost entirely identical in Wilmington, Ohio and in Kemerovo, Western Siberia — and to be fair, so is their well-justified apprehension of liberal snobbery. ### The other side of this global divide is hardly made of intellectually and morally impeccable elves, but it knows enough to realize that the collective dementia of Trumpism or Putinism is potentially suicidal and requires urgent treatment. In Russia, this group is infinitely smaller, but also more refined. Putin was first elected in 2000, in a vote that international monitors described as generally in line with democratic standards, and has since spent 18 long years suppressing and co-opting the opposition. The anti-Putin movement shrank to the point of virtual negligibility by the end of his second term, but it reinvented itself and has been on the rise ever since the Bolotnaya protests of 2012 — and it has a clear and truly capable leader, Aleksey Navalny. ### The anti-Trump train in the US, in comparison, is still full of accidental passengers who will soon get off because they are culturally closer to the Trumpists. These accidental passengers aren’t that different from their opponents when it comes to blaming their country’s ills on foreign conspiracies and spitting out xenophobic vitriol against their chosen enemy — Russians in their case. Wait to see how this part of the movement looks at the end of Trump's second term. Or his fourth. ### The same cultural divide — between irresponsible nativist populism and weak disoriented liberalism — defines the political landscape in Europe. Some countries, like Britain, Italy, Poland and Hungary, have already been radically altered by their versions of Trumpism-Putinism, while others — notably Germany and France — are successfully repelling the onslaught. ### They’re also becoming more explicit in explaining the gap that has emerged. “We do not share the same model of civilization, clearly we don’t share certain values,” a French government spokesperson said in late June when describing the Trump administration’s policy of separating families at the Mexican border. Naturally, he spoke only for a part of French society. On other side of the global barricade, millions of French supporters of Marine Le Pen’s far right are on the same wavelength as Trump on issues like immigration and borders. ### What the Trump-Putin summit really highlights is the end of sovereign domestic politics as we know it. Yes, Kremlin operatives meddled in a foreign election. So did the Obama administration when it financed Russian election monitoring groups, whose successful work to expose vote rigging triggered the Bolotnaya protests in 2012. Russian officials were also subject to hacker attacks, as in the case of Putin spin-doctor Vladislav Surkov whose emails, released in October 2016, at the height of the US hacking scandal, exposed the extent of Russian involvement in stirring up conflict in Ukraine. ### In other countries of the former Soviet block, like Georgia, it is hard to say whether the US merely meddled or actually took over elements of governance, so deep and direct was its influence on the country’s politics. But ask pro-Western Russians or Georgians and they’ll have few bad things to say about this kind of meddling. Many Trump supporters are also quietly content that Putin might have lent them a hand. ### In this new globalized political divide, there will be more, not less, foreign influence and meddling in domestic politics. The emerging global political movements, such as the one that unites Trump, Putin and European far-right populists, are already threatening old territorial alliances, notably NATO and the EU, as well as international trade agreements. ### A dark shadow behind this Illiberal International is what commentators tend to describe as a mafia state, which spans from Siberian oil wells and mineral deposits plundered by Putin’s entourage to European financial centers in London and Zurich and virtual offshores in Delaware and Nevada. It has a huge interest in obscuring cross-border financial dealings and preventing international cooperation on money laundering. ### Meanwhile, a global liberal block is taking time to emerge, although Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are already providing its core. This is a brave new world and we should all learn to live in it. ### Leonid Ragozin is a freelance journalist based in Riga.

Sign up for more newsletters here ### But Trump’s comments Monday were in sync with the argument Putin and his government have long made, which is that the policies of the Obama administration - as well as the investigation into election interference, which Putin repeatedly has denied - inflamed tensions between the to nuclear superpowers. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s official Twitter account liked Trump’s ‘‘U.S. foolishness and stupidity’’ tweet. ### Earlier in his Europe trip, Trump told reporters he would raise the election interference issue with Putin, although he indicated that he would not be too stern, saying he assumes Putin will deny responsibility, and then they would move on to other topics. ### In another Monday morning tweet, Trump sought to pin blame for the matter on former president Barack Obama. ### ‘‘President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!’’ Trump wrote, referencing first 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and then former FBI agent Peter Strzok, who testified before Congress in a combative hearing last week. ### Advertisement ### Trump arrived with first lady Melania Trump in Helsinki late Sunday, after spending the weekend golfing at his property in Scotland. Aboard Air Force One, the president aired some of his grievances on Twitter ahead his upcoming summit with Putin. ### ‘‘Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!’’ Trump wrote. ### And after a week of denigrating the U.S. news media on foreign soil, Trump continued in his tweetstorm: ‘‘Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct! This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country - but at some point, it will heal!’’ ### Trump began his day Monday in this Nordic capital by meeting Finnish President Sauli Niinisto for breakfast, along with their wives. When a reporter asked his message for Putin, Trump replied, ‘‘We’ll do just fine.’’ ### Trump also touted the unity of NATO, saying the treaty alliance of 29 nations that is a Western bulwark against an expansionist Russia, has ‘‘never been stronger than it is today.’’ ### Advertisement ### Last week in Brussels, Trump upended the NATO summit with demands that European allies increase their defense spending commitments. On Monday in Helsinki, Trump claimed credit for forcing the hands of his counterparts. ‘‘It was a little bit tough at the beginning,’’ he said, ‘‘but it turned out to be love.’’ ### Beyond spreading a positive image of Russia, the World Cup also gave Putin a chance to exercise his diplomatic chops ahead of the Helsinki summit amid a revolving door of visiting world leaders. On Sunday alone, Putin met with French President Emmanuel Macron; Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban; Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic; and Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. ### Last week, Putin separately received Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stoking speculation that Putin would discuss Iran’s presence in Syria with Trump. ### Russian officials have kept expectations low, emphasizing that the very fact of the meeting is an important step forward after years of tensions between Moscow and Washington. Ahead the summit, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov praised Trump’s pragmatism in an interview with pro-Kremlin broadcaster RT. ### ‘‘Our president is very pragmatic, very open and consistent,’’ Peskov said, referring to Putin, according to the Interfax news agency. ‘‘He always says that the interests of Russia and the people of Russia are the main thing to him. And therefore he respects the fact that Donald Trump has the same attitude to his country.’’ ### For Putin, the setting of the summit provides something of a home-turf advantage. Although Finland is a member of the European Union and is a neutral nation, it borders Russia and is familiar to Putin, as Helsinki is just up the Bay of Finland from his hometown of St. Petersburg. ### This vibrant Nordic capital, which in the summertime glistens with sunlight late into the evening, holds significant resonance for U.S.-Russia affairs as a neutral site for leaders of the two countries to meet. ### In 1990, then-president George H.W. Bush met in Helsinki with then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to show a unified front against then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein amid escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf. And in 1997, then-president Bill Clinton and then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin held a two-day summit here to discuss arms control and the addition of former Soviet countries into NATO. ### Trump has said he has low expectations for Monday’s summit with Putin, and heads into it without the kind of pre-scripted outcomes typical at such international meetings. Rather, he sees the meeting as a chance to build a better rapport with Putin and foster warmer relations between the United States and Russia. ### ‘‘Right now, there’s no trust in the relationship, and because of that, problem-solving is practically impossible,’’ U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman said Sunday on NBC’s ‘‘Meet the Press.’’ ‘‘So this is an attempt to see if we can defuse and take some of the drama, and quite frankly some of the danger, out of the relationship right now.’’ ### Trump and his advisers have sought to temper expectations for the summit, which is expected to include discussions over the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, a Reagan-era arms-control agreement and the prospect of extending a 2011 nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia. ### The president declined to outline his objectives in an interview with CBS News in advance of the summit, and his advisers have said the mere act of holding the direct meeting with Putin is a ‘‘deliverable.’’ ### Back in Washington, lawmakers from both parties have implored Trump to aggressively confront Putin. ### ‘‘President Trump should have only one message for Putin (on Monday): Quit messing with America,’’ Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said on Twitter early Monday, arguing that Trump should not be ‘‘dignifying’’ the Russian president by granting a meeting. ### Putin’s allies say that last Friday’s indictments represented the latest effort by the Washington establishment to derail Trump’s effort to improve relations with Russia. ### ‘‘It seems to us the opponents of the improvement of U.S.-Russia relations should not be allowed to endlessly exploit this harmful topic, which is being kept afloat artificially,’’ Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said ahead of the summit, according to Interfax. ### "

12192,yahoo.com/news,2018-07-16T04:08:00-04:00,"Trump blames Washington for poor Russia ties ahead of Putin summit ### By Jeff Mason and Andrew Osborn ### , ### July 16, 2018 ### By Jeff Mason and Andrew Osborn ### HELSINKI (Reuters) - Hours before he was due to sit down for his first ever summit with Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump blamed ""U.S. foolishness"" for bad relations between Washington and Moscow, while the Kremlin said it expected a tough meeting. ### Trump's comments show how much domestic political pressure he is under over the meeting in the Finnish capital Helsinki, while the Kremlin's gloomy comments reflect its belief that the fact the summit is even happening is a win for Russia. ### Critics and his own advisers have urged Trump to use the summit to press Putin hard about election meddling and other “malign” activities. But hours before he was due to meet the Russian president, Trump focused his ire on his own country and the investigation into possible links between his 2016 campaign and Russia. The president has denied any collusion took place. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" wrote Trump on Twitter, referring to the investigation into possible collusion. ### During a breakfast meeting with Finland's president before the meeting with Putin in the Finnish capital, Trump appeared upbeat. Asked what he would say to the Russian president, Trump said: ""We'll be just fine, thank you."" ### Trump also repeated his belief that predecessor Barack Obama had failed to act on Russian meddling. ### While Trump has been abroad since last week, the special prosecutor investigating allegations that Russia interfered to help Trump win the 2016 presidential election indicted 12 Russians on Friday for stealing Democratic Party documents. ### Trump's foes at home have been scathing about his apparent refusal to criticize Putin. His 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton tweeted: ""Great World Cup. Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?"" ### Neither side expects major breakthroughs from the talks and the outcome is uncertain given sharp differences between Washington and Moscow over everything from Syria to Ukraine. ### For Putin, the fact that the summit is even happening despite Russia's semi-pariah status among some Americans and U.S. allies is a geopolitical win because, in Russian eyes, it shows that Washington recognizes Moscow as a great power that cannot be isolated or ignored. ### The Kremlin made clear beforehand it did not expect an easy meeting, taking Trump to task over his criticism of a planned Russian gas pipeline to Germany and suggesting it would be hard to find common ground on Syria because of differences over Iran. ### Trump wants Russia to help Moscow to use its influence in Syria where it is backing President Bashar al-Assad militarily to push Iranian and Iranian-allied forces out. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia's RT TV station ahead of the summit that was unlikely. ### ""Of course Syria will be discussed by the two presidents,"" said Peskov. ""We all know what Washington thinks of Iran. But at the same time Iran is a good partner to us in terms of trade, economic cooperation and political dialogue. So this will not be an easy exchange of views."" ### Russia hoped however that the summit would be ""the first step"" in overcoming a crisis in relations, he said. ### ""Presidents Trump and Putin respect each other and they get along well. There is no clear agenda. It will be determined by the heads of state themselves as they go along."" ### LOW EXPECTATIONS ### Trump has predicted he will be accused of being too soft on Putin no matter how the summit goes. ### ""...If I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia...I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" he tweeted on Sunday. ### He has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling with Putin, but does not expect to get anywhere. ### The most analysts believe the summit could yield, beyond warm words, is an agreement to begin repairing battered U.S.-Russia relations, and maybe a deal to start talks on issues such as nuclear arms control and Syria. ### The two men could also agree to start restocking their respective embassies and returning confiscated diplomatic property after a wave of expulsions and retaliatory action prompted by the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. ### The Helsinki summit is the capstone to a nearly week-long trip for Trump during which he has sown doubts about his commitment to the NATO military alliance, Washington's so-called special relationship with Britain, and U.S. relations with the European Union that he called ""a foe"" on trade. ### Against that backdrop and swirling uncertainty about what Trump might do or say next, his summit with Putin, which will include a one-on-one session with the Russian leader with only interpreters present, has both U.S. allies and U.S. politicians worried lest he make hasty and sweeping concessions. ### Some politicians in the West believe the summit is happening at one of the most crucial junctures for the West since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Certain NATO allies fear Putin might seek a grand deal that would undermine the U.S.-led transatlantic alliance. ### Trump has spoken vaguely about the possibility of halting NATO war games in the Baltic region, and has said repeatedly that it would be good if he could get along with Russia. ### When asked last month if he would recognize Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, he replied: ""We're going to have to see."" ### Many Western politicians remain angry over Russia's annexation of Crimea, its backing of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine and its support for Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Other accusations, denied by Moscow, include that it meddled in European politics, supplied the weapon that shot down a passenger plane in 2014 over Ukraine, and was behind the poisoning of the former Russian spy in Britain. ### (The story is refiled to add Trump's name, dropped from first paragraph.) ### (Additonal reporting by Steve Holland in Helsinki and by Christian Lowe and Polina Devitt in Moscow; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Peter Graff)"

Trump tweeted. ### Just days earlier, Trump pointed to the ""pure stupidity"" and a ""political problem"" in the United States for making it ""very hard to do something with Russia."" ### ""Anything you do, it's always going to be, 'Oh, Russia, he loves Russia,' "" Trump said during a joint news conference with his British counterpart. ### Trump's Monday morning tweet and his words and actions in the last week have only amplified concerns about his approach to Russia among US allies and lawmakers of both parties in Washington. During his swing through Brussels and the United Kingdom, Trump has repeatedly criticized US allies, called the European Union a ""foe"" and criticized the Obama administration rather than Russia in the wake of the Justice Department's indictment of 12 Russian agents who allegedly worked to hack Democrats' emails and computer networks during the 2016 election. ### Ahead of his meeting with Putin -- who is alleged to be behind the assassination of journalists and political dissidents -- the US President also lashed out again at the news media on Sunday by branding journalists ""the enemy of the people."" ### Trump again -- as he has repeatedly done -- pointed the finger at his predecessor President Barack Obama and characterized the investigation stemming from Russian election interference as a ""witch hunt."" ### ""President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it,"" Trump tweeted. ""When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!"" ### Everything from Russian meddling in the 2016 election to the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine are expected to be on the agenda for their summit here in Helsinki, but Trump has signaled he is most eager to jumpstart talks to ""substantially reduce"" the two countries' nuclear weapons arsenals and generally improve US-Russia relations. ### Trump has said he intends to once again ask Putin about Russian efforts to sway the results of the 2016 election, but has signaled he will not press the issue. ### ""I know you'll ask, will we be talking about meddling. I will absolutely bring that up. I don't think you'll have any, 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.' There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think, but you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely, firmly ask the question,"" Trump said. ### Trump has sought to cool expectations in the last days leading up to the summit, saying in an interview Saturday that he planned to arrive in Helsinki ""with very low expectations."" ### ""I think that getting along with Russia is a good thing, but it's possible we won't,"" Trump said. ### Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

Winds NE at 5 to 10 mph. ### Updated: July 16, 2018 @ 6:52 am ### Close ### President Donald Trump attends a working breakfast with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday. ### THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ### Trump and Putin going one-on-one in Helsinki ### 4 hrs ago ### Save ### HELSINKI (AP) — President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin opened their summit Monday with serious expression all around and the American president declaring that ""the world wants to see us get along."" ### Trump laid out a list of topics for discussion that notably did not include Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. ### ""We have not been getting along well for the last number of years,"" Trump said as he and Putin sat down at the Presidential Palace in Finland's capital. ""But I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship. ... I really think the world wants to see us get along."" ### Putin, for his part, said he and Trump have maintained regular contact by phone and meeting at international events but ""the time has come to have a thorough discussion on various international problems and sensitive issues."" He added, speaking through a translator: ""There are quite a few of them for us to pay attention to."" ### Putin struck a casual pose during Trump's remarks, slouching in his chair with his legs wide and eyes low. He nodded along to some of Trump's remarks before they were translated, showcasing his fluency in English. Trump leaned forward in his chair, his hands tented in front of him and frequently glancing over at his Russian counterpart. After Trump concluded his remarks, American reporters shouted several questions about whether he would bring up election meddling during his discussions with Putin. ### Trump did not respond; Putin appeared to smirk. ### With that, the two leaders gave a quick handshake and their private meeting in the opulent Gothic Hall was under way. Just the two of them, each with a translator. ### The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States — and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea — for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow's aggression may go unchallenged. ### ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,"" Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming ""many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" ### The summit, which was being closely monitored by rattled world capitals, was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump's presidential campaign. Undeterred, the American president was set to go face to face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian's leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British queen, among many others. ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn't ""expect anything"" from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go ""fine."" ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. Not mentioned: Election meddling or Syria. ### Trump said last week that he would raise the election-meddling issue with Putin, but said he didn't expect Putin to budge on his denials. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" said Trump, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### They'll continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a ""witch hunt."""

John Cornyn says that Mr. Trump appears to be ""conflating"" that aspect of Mueller's probe with questions about possible collusion between the Russian government and members of the Trump campaign. He told ""Face the Nation"" that Mr. Trump takes the investigation personally and ""feels like he's been under attack."" ### ""The politics of this are very tempting to our friends across the aisle. But I think he's conflating those two, as are a number of other people, and we need to keep those separate. Yes, the Russians did mettle. Number two, did any American involved collude with them? And so far there's no evidence,"" Cornyn said Sunday. ### Cornyn's comments come after the Justice Department announced a new indictment against 12 Russians for their alleged involvement in hacking Democratic computer systems and stealing party data. In an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Jeff Glor on Saturday, Mr. Trump said that he ""hadn't thought of"" asking Putin to turn over the accused Russians during the leaders' meeting in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday. ### ""I hadn't thought of that. But I certainly, I'll be asking about it. But again, this was during the Obama administration.

""I agree that the Russians did meddle in our elections and we better be prepared for the next time. But again there's no indication that it had an outcome -- that it changed outcome of the election."" ### Despite widespread concerns from Republicans and Democrats over the president meeting privately with Putin, Cornyn said that ""it's always helpful when leaders of nations talk to one another."" ### ""To me it would be counterproductive just to ignore that or to avoid that possibility. On the other hand, I think the president should be clear-eyed about who he's dealing with. Putin is an autocrat. He's a thug. He does not respect the rule of law. Obviously doesn't respect our democracy and wants to undermine it every chance he gets.

Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, says  President Trump should ask Russian President Vladimir Putin where exactly ""we can pick up the 25 Russians"" who have indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. ### ""I would ask the president to give some serious consideration, your first request of Vladimir Putin needs to be, 'Tell us which airport we can pick up the 25 Russians that tried to interfere with the fundamentals of our democracy,'"" Gowdy told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. ### Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet with Putin one-on-one in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday. ### Gowdy suggested that Mr. Trump tell Putin: ""If you really claim that you had nothing to do with it, then you should be as shocked as we were that your military being used to impact our election, tell us where your going to extradite those folks because an American grand jury indicted them for undermining our democracy."" ### Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the  indictment of 12 more Russians  on Friday for their alleged attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Rosenstein said the 12 defendants are all members of the Russian intelligence arm GRU, and attempted to interfere with the 2016 presidential election by ""spear-phishing"" volunteers and employees of Hillary Clinton's campaign. ### In February, the Justice Department indicted 13 other Russians and three Russian companies for their alleged involvement in the effort to influence the 2016 race. ### Gowdy noted that no American has been named in an indictment as having conspired with the Russians. Gowdy, who is a leading figure in a separate congressional probe into election interference, said that Mueller's investigation is not a ""witch hunt"" and instead said his focus is on what exactly did Russia do to the U.S. election system. ### ""This is an attack on all of us,"" Gowdy added of Russia's campaign. ### Gowdy also weighed in on his contentious exchange with FBI official Peter Strzok during an all-day congressional hearing last week, alleging an ""unprecedented level of bias"" on Strzok's part. ### Gowdy traded barbs with Strzok and even fellow colleagues during the joint session of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committee on Thursday, repeatedly slamming the FBI agent for his alleged bias against Mr. Trump.

With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday’s meeting in Helsinki, here’s a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### “I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much,” Trump told reporters last week. ### Trump has strenuously insisted that improved relations with Russia would benefit the United States. But much of the appeal of the Finland meeting is simply to have the summit itself and to bolster ties between Washington and Moscow and between Putin and Trump, who places his personal rapport with foreign leaders near the heart of his foreign policy. ### “The fact that we’re having a summit at this level, at this time in history, is a deliverable in itself,” said Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia. “What is important here is that we start a discussion.” ### Trump has been drawn to the spectacle of the summit and has expressed an eagerness to recreate in Helsinki the media show of last month’s Singapore summit when he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### Even as many NATO leaders made supportive noises this week, the Helsinki summit has raised fears in many global capitals that Trump will pull back from traditional Western alliances, allowing Putin to expand his sphere of influence. ### Back home, too, there is wariness on Capitol Hill, with a number of Democrats and a handful of Republicans urging Trump to cancel the summit in the wake of the explosive indictments. ### But Trump has vowed that he can handle Putin, whom he has taken to referring to as a “competitor” rather than an adversary. ### And Trump in recent days has outlined some of the items he’d like to discuss, including Ukraine. Though the president has said he was “not happy” about Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, he puts the blame on his predecessor and says he will continue relations with Putin even if Moscow refuses to return the peninsula. ### Trump also said he and Putin would discuss the ongoing war in Syria and arms control, negotiations that White House officials have signaled could be fruitful. ### “I will be talking about nuclear proliferation,” the president said alongside British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday. “We’ve been modernizing and fixing and buying. And it’s just a devastating technology. And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it’s a very, very bad policy.” ### But it is the matter of election meddling, including fears Russia could try to interfere in the midterm elections this fall, that could play a central role in the summit talks or loom even larger if not addressed. In neither of Trump’s previous meetings with Putin — informal talks on the sidelines of summits last year in Germany and Vietnam — did the president publicly upbraid the Russian leader, prompting questions about whether he believed the former KGB officer’s denials over his own intelligence agencies’ assessments of meddling. ### Trump repeatedly has cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking of his Democratic rivals and disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a “witch hunt.” But he said in Britain that he would raise it with Putin even as he downplayed its impact. ### “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,’” Trump said, invoking a television detective. “There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question.” ### WHAT PUTIN WANTS ### For Putin, sitting down with Trump offers a long-awaited chance to begin repairing relations with Washington after years of spiraling tensions. ### Putin wants the U.S. and its allies to lift sanctions, pull back NATO forces deployed near Russia’s borders and restore business as usual with Moscow. In the longer run, he hopes to persuade the U.S. to acknowledge Moscow’s influence over its former Soviet neighbors and, more broadly, recognize Russia as a global player whose interests must be taken into account. ### These are long-term goals, and Putin realizes that no significant progress will come from just one meeting. More than anything else, he sees Monday’s summit as an opportunity to develop good rapport with Trump and set the stage for regular high-level contacts. ### “Russia-U.S. ties aren’t just at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, they never were as bad as they are now,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, who chairs the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an influential Moscow-based association of policy experts. “It’s unhealthy and abnormal when the leaders of the two nuclear powers capable of destroying each other and the rest of the world don’t meet.” ### Moscow views Trump’s criticism of NATO allies and his recent comments about wanting Russia back in the Group of Seven club of leading industrialized nations with guarded optimism but no euphoria. Initially excited about Trump’s election, the Kremlin has long realized that his hands are bound by the ongoing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Moscow. ### Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in parliament’s upper house, wrote in his blog that Russia won’t engage in vague talk about “illusory subjects,” such as the prospect of lifting Western sanctions or Russia’s return to the G-7. ### Putin knows it would be unrealistic to expect U.S. recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea or a quick rollback of sanctions approved by Congress. Instead, he’s likely to focus on issues where compromise is possible to help melt the ice. ### Syria is one area where Moscow and Washington could potentially reach common ground. ### One possible agreement could see Washington give a tacit go-ahead for a Syrian army deployment along the border with Israel in exchange for the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies, whose presence in the area represents a red line for Israel. ### There is little hope for any quick progress on other major issues. ### Kosachev said it would be “pointless” to discuss Russian meddling in the U.S. election, which Moscow firmly denies. He also warned that demands for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine or revise its policy on eastern Ukraine would be equally fruitless. The Kremlin sees Crimea’s status as non-negotiable and puts the blame squarely on the Ukrainian government for the lack of progress on a 2015 plan to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine. ### Putin has held the door open for a possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers to separate the warring sides, but firmly rejected Ukraine’s push for their presence along the border with Russia. ### On arms control, one area where the U.S. and Russia might reach agreement is a possible extension of the New START treaty, set to expire in 2021, which caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550 for each country. ### The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, is supposed to last indefinitely but has increasingly run into trouble. The U.S. has accused Russia of violating the terms of the treaty by developing a new cruise missile, which Moscow has denied. ### Russia has pledged adherence to both treaties, but it has become less focused on arms control agreements than in the past, when it was struggling to maintain nuclear parity with the U.S. ### After complaining about U.S. missile defense plans as a major threat to Russia, Putin in March unveiled an array of new weapons he said would render the U.S. missile shield useless, including a hypersonic intercontinental strike vehicle and a long-range nuclear-powered underwater drone armed with an atomic weapon. ### “Russia was much weaker, and the weak always try to appeal to international law,” Lukyanov said. “But the atmosphere is different now, and Russia is much more self-confident.”"

The summit was starting later than scheduled because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour late in another display of the Russian's leader famous lack of punctuality. ### Trump seemed to return the favour by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British Queen, among many others. ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. ### He told CBS News that he didn't 'expect anything' from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn't looking for any 'concrete deliverables.' ### Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland's president that he thought the summit would go 'fine.' ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a 'witch hunt.' ### In his tweets, Trump continued to undermine the investigation and blamed his predecessor, Barack Obama, for failing to stop Russia's efforts to sway the 2016 election in Trump's favor. ### He claimed Obama 'was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it.' ### The Obama administration did, in fact, take action, including confronting Putin in person as well as expelling nearly three dozen Russian diplomats the U.S. said were actually intelligence operatives and imposing new sanctions. ### While Trump was eager for a made-for-TV moment that will dominate headlines like his sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month, the Kremlin's primary mission was simply to have the summit happen. ### Putin hopes the meeting, mere hours after he presided over the World Cup finals, will help him forge good personal ties with Trump and focus on areas where Moscow and Washington may be able to find common ground, such as Syria. ### The two leaders first meet one on one in the Finnish presidential palace's opulent Gothic Hall, then continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor's throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### Putin will likely not be shooting for official recognition of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea or easing of the crippling U.S. sanctions, aware that the U.S. Congress would never allow such action. ### But he would welcome a symbolic end to Western protests over Crimea and Moscow's attempts to destabilize elections and traditional Western alliances and norms. ### Trump unleashed his own attacks on those very institutions before arriving in Finland. ### In an interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, Trump described the European Union, a bloc of nations that includes many of America's closest allies, as a 'foe.' ### That attack on the alliance came on the heels of Trump's jarring appearance at a NATO summit in Brussels, where he harshly criticized traditional allies over 'delinquent' defense spending only to later confirm his commitment to the military alliance that has long been a bulwark against Russian aggression. ### 'NATO is now strong & rich!' Trump wrote in a celebratory tweet Monday morning. During his breakfast, he said NATO had 'never been more together' and said the summit had been 'a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love.' ### Prior to meeting Putin, who has cracked down on the free press, Trump unleashed fresh attacks on the news media, including from aboard Air Force One as it descended into Helsinki. ### 'Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough - that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!' Trump tweeted. 'Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems know how to do is resist and obstruct!' ### 'Russia has done nothing to deserve us meeting them in this way,' said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute who specializes in Russia, Ukraine and disinformation. For Putin, she added, 'not only is this a P.R. coup no matter what happens, Trump could say nothing and it would help to legitimize his regime.' ### Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and ongoing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. ### Trump said in Britain last week - another chaotic stop on his European tour - that he would raise the issue of election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### 'I don't think you'll have any `Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'' said Trump, invoking a television detective. 'There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question.' ### Trump also said in the CBS interview that he had given no thought to asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets. ### But after being asked about that by his interviewer, Trump said 'certainly I'll be asking about it' although extradition is highly unlikely. The U.S. doesn't have an extradition treaty with Moscow and can't force the Russians to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution also prohibits turning over citizens to foreign governments. ### Putin is likely to strongly reaffirm his denial of any meddling and cast the U.S. charges as unfounded. ### The Russian Foreign Ministry rejected last week's indictment as part of a 'shameful comedy' staged by those in the U.S. who try to prevent the normalization of Russia-U.S. ties, arguing that it doesn't contain evidence to back the accusations. ### On Syria, a possible deal could see Moscow helping mediate the withdrawal of Iranian forces and their Hezbollah proxies from the areas alongside Syria's border with Israel - a diplomatic coup that would reflect Russia's carefully cultivated ties with both Israel and Iran. ### While both Putin and Trump spoke about the need to discuss arms control issues, they are unlikely to make any quick deals. They may underline the importance of continuing the discussions, setting the stage for discussions on expert level. ### Advertisement"

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) ###  ### By Solange Reyner    |   Sunday, 15 July 2018 08:39 PM ### Close ### A   A ###  ### Russian President Vladimir Putin is the “ringmaster” behind Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.” ### “Part of the reason for this indictment is to stigmatize those involved in interfering in our election. Putin is essentially an unindicted co-conspirator,” Schiff said, referring to special counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment Friday of 12 Russian intelligence officers in the hacking of Democrats during the 2016 election. ### “And not just any co-conspirator,” Schiff told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “He’s the ringmaster of this conspiracy, and he’s going to be sitting down at the table with Donald Trump.” ### Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, last week called for Trump to cancel his summit with Putin Monday in Helsinki. The fact he isn’t, said Schiff, means “Trump is basically saying the indictment is just a witch hunt. And that’s a great gift for Vladimir Putin.” ### “So, I think if Kim Jong Un can eat the president’s lunch, which I think he clearly did, it will be a very easy matter for Vladimir Putin,” he added. ### Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, heeded a similar warning and said he wasn’t confident Trump would make Russia’s interference “a top point of his agenda.” ### “I’d feel a lot better if U.S. Ambassador [to Russia Jon] Huntsman, who I have a lot of confidence in, was actually sitting in on the meeting,” he said during an interview on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” ### “I'm very concerned about a one-on-one meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump,” Warner said. “We know that Trump doesn't do a lot of prep work for these meetings. He kind of goes in and wings it.” ### Related Stories:"

Endless media hype. Huge ratings. ### Although President Donald Trump has met with Russia's Vladimir Putin twice before, he is eager to recreate in Finland the heady experience that he had last month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore: a summit that became a mass media event complete with powerful presidential images. Ever the showman and insistent on establishing closer ties to Moscow, Trump overruled his advisers and demanded the rituals and pageantry of a formal summit. ### Trump had boasted to confidants about the number of cameras in Singapore, claiming it dwarfed coverage of the Oscars, according to a person familiar with his thinking but not authorized to discuss private conversations and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Though Trump originally expressed concern that Helsinki was not glamorous enough and favored hosting Putin at the White House, the president was reassured by aides that it would be an effective backdrop. And long believing in the power of personal connections, he has insisted to aides that it was essential to sit down with Putin to establish a rapport. ### ""He's been very nice to me the times I've met him. I've been nice to him. He's a competitor,"" Trump said of Putin last week in Brussels. ""You know, somebody was saying, 'Is he an enemy?' No, he's not my enemy. 'Is he a friend?' No, I don't know him well enough."" ### Drawing on his experience as a marketer and salesman, Trump has long been convinced that his mastery of powerful images has been essential to his political rise. The president has told advisers that the Singapore diplomacy made him look like a take-charge president. And it was not lost on him that his poll numbers received a temporary bump after the meeting. ### With the same attention to detail that he devoted to campaign ads, Trump masterminded many of the looks for his meeting with Kim, including the two leaders' dramatic initial greeting and handshake and, later, their one-on-one time. At one point, he startled the Secret Service by giving Kim an impromptu tour of some mighty American machinery — the presidential limousine known as ""The Beast."" ### Though the results from the North Korea summit are debatable, Trump has told confidants he believed it was a masterstroke, according to three outside advisers and White House officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. ### Always favoring bold gambits that would separate him from his predecessors, Trump believed that the historic meeting with Kim was potentially his ticket for a Nobel Peace Prize and would become an essential part of his legacy. While summits with Russian leaders are far more common, Trump believes a similar boost would occur if he can improve relations with Moscow and get Putin to make concessions never attained by President Barack Obama. ### ""I could say: 'Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Syria,'"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News last month. ""'Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Ukraine?'"" ### And while the imagery of Singapore made the idea of a Putin summit that much more tantalizing, Trump was already keen on setting up a one-on-one meeting, even with the risks entailed in meeting an experienced leader who is also a former KGB official. ### The president met with Putin on the sidelines of international summits last year — once in Germany, once in Vietnam — and both times he invited his Russian counterpart to the White House, according to three current and former administration officials. He reiterated the invitation on a call with Putin this spring and initially told aides that he wanted to have the meeting at the White House. ### He was later convinced to do it abroad, tacking the summit onto his planned visit to Belgium and Britain. Initially concerned that Helsinki was not a fitting location, Trump relented after being briefed on the history of U.S.-Russia summits in Finland and after seeing that it could be scheduled after a visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland, according to the three outside advisers and officials. ### But many in Washington are leery of the summit occurring anywhere, believing that just by agreeing to meet, Trump has offered further global legitimacy to Putin, who will preside over the World Cup final in Moscow the day before the summit. Aides have argued to Trump that the chances of substantive progress on a host of thorny issues, including Syria and Ukraine, are slim. ### Longtime American allies and White House aides alike have expressed concerns about the meeting. Hovering over Helsinki is the specter of the 2016 election interference and the ongoing special counsel probe into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russia. There were calls from Capitol Hill for the president to cancel the summit after Friday's indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in an effort to help Trump. ### ""If President Trump is not prepared to hold Putin accountable, the summit in Helsinki should not move forward,"" said Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. ### But the White House has insisted the meeting is on. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking and frequently derided special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible links between Russia and his campaign as a ""witch hunt."" But he said in Britain that he would raise the election meddling with Putin even as he played down its impact. ### ""I don't think you'll have any 'Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'"" Trump said on Friday, invoking a television detective. ""There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question."" ### ___"

With no set agenda, the summit could veer between spectacle and substance. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin head into Monday's meeting in Helsinki, here's a look at what each president may be hoping to achieve: ### WHAT TRUMP WANTS ### What Trump wants from Russia has long been one of the great mysteries of his presidency. ### The president will go into the summit followed by whispers about his ties to Moscow, questions that have grown only more urgent since the Justice Department last week indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of interfering in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump. ### And while most summits featuring an American president are carefully scripted affairs designed to produce a tangible result, Trump will go face-to-face with Putin having done scant preparation, possessing no clear agenda and saddled with a track record that, despite his protests, suggests he may not sharply challenge his Russian counterpart over election meddling. ### ___ ### Young Nubians revive dream of returning to land in Egypt ### ASWAN, Egypt (AP) - The world of their parents and grandparents was turned upside down more than 50 years ago when they were evacuated from villages along the Nile River to make way for the High Dam. Now a younger generation has revived the long-dormant cause of Egypt's Nubians, campaigning for a return to their lands and struggling to preserve their culture. ### Their timing could not have been worse. ### Recent peaceful marches by Nubians were met by swift suppression from the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, which has shown little tolerance for dissent. To a state dominated by the military and security agencies, Nubians' assertion of their distinct identity and heritage amid the Arab majority looks like a threat to stability. ### ""This country has so many colors and ethnicities, and it is so destructive that we are trying to give it just one identity,"" said Fatmah Imam, a Nubian activist born and raised in Cairo. Even during her days at university, she recalled, the message instilled was that the country should be homogeneous. ### ""It is painful for me that I am unable to manifest my identity,"" she said. ""I see Egypt as a mosaic."" ### ___ ### S. Korea probes army plan for troops to control protesters ### SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - A group of army generals rolling tanks and troops into Seoul to seize power. Paratroopers firing at large crowds calling for democracy. Tanks and armored vehicles stationed at universities to intimidate student protesters. ### Such scenes of military intervention in South Korea have been nonexistent since the country achieved democracy in the late 1980s. But revelations this past week of a document showing the military drafted plans to mobilize troops to suppress protests last year have struck a nerve among people in one of Asia's most vibrant and wealthiest democracies. Some allege the plans even included a scenario for a coup. ### The memories of brutal, military-backed dictatorships that imprisoned, tortured and executed dissidents remain vivid to many South Koreans. But most experts say the actual chances for another coup in South Korea are extremely low. A look at the explosive revelations and why a coup is nearly impossible to pull off today: ### ___ ### ___ ### US judge criticizes plan to reunify families split at border ### SAN DIEGO (AP) - A federal judge, responding to a plan to reunify children separated at the border, said he was having second thoughts about his belief that the Trump administration was acting in good faith to comply with his orders. ### The Justice Department on Friday filed a plan to reunify more than 2,500 children age 5 and older by a court-imposed deadline of July 26 using ""truncated"" procedures to verify parentage and perform background checks, which exclude DNA testing and other steps it took to reunify children under 5. ### The administration said the abbreviated vetting puts children at significant safety risk but is needed to meet the deadline. ### Chris Meekins, deputy assistant Health and Human Services secretary for preparedness and response, filed a declaration that he is fully committed to meeting the deadline. However, he does not believe ""the placing of children into such situations is consistent with the mission of HHS or my core values."" ### U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw took umbrage at Meekins' statement, disputing the official's interpretation of his orders and saying that safe reunification could and will occur by July 26. ### ___ ### Trump's remarks about changing European culture draw ire ### WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump's lament this week that immigration is ""changing the culture"" of Europe echoed rising anti-immigrant feelings on both sides of the Atlantic, where Europe and the United States are going through a demographic transformation that makes some of the white majority uncomfortable. ### Historians and advocates immediately denounced Trump's comments, saying such talk would encourage white nationalists. ### ""The way he put this argument about changing our culture ... about Europe becoming less nice than it is, in other words, these people are here and they are making the culture crappy and making the place lesser, that's straight out of the white supremacist/white nationalist playbook,"" said Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project. ### Trump, in an interview with the British newspaper The Sun, blamed immigration for a changing culture in Europe: ""I think allowing millions and millions of people to come into Europe is very, very sad. I think you are losing your culture. Look around. You go through certain areas that didn't exist ten or 15 years ago."" ### Trump, the grandson of a German immigrant and the son of a Scottish immigrant to the United States, repeated his contention at a news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May: ### ___ ### US official: Russia using social media to divide Americans ### PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The U.S. homeland security secretary said on Saturday there are no signs that Russia is targeting this year's midterm elections with the same ""scale or scope"" it targeted the 2016 presidential election. ### Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen spoke at a convention of state secretaries of state, an event that's usually a low-key affair highlighting voter registration, balloting devices and election security issues that don't get much public attention. But coming amid fresh allegations into Russia's attempts to sway the 2016 election, the sessions on election security have a higher level of urgency and interest. ### Nielsen said her agency will help state and local election officials prepare their systems for cyberattacks from Russia or elsewhere. She said U.S. intelligence officials are seeing ""persistent Russian efforts using social media, sympathetic spokespeople and other fronts to sow discord and divisiveness amongst the American people, though not necessarily focused on specific politicians or political campaigns."" ### The conference of top state election officials she addressed was sandwiched between Friday's indictments of 12 Russian military intelligence officers alleged to have hacked into Democratic party and campaign accounts and Monday's long-awaited meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### Trump has never condemned Russia over meddling in the 2016 election despite the findings of all top U.S. intelligence agencies, and the Kremlin has insisted it didn't meddle in the U.S. election. In the past, Trump has reiterated Putin's denials, but this week he said he would bring up the issue when they meet on Monday in Finland. ### ___ ### Angry crowd protests after Chicago police fatally shoot man ### CHICAGO (AP) - An angry crowd shouted and threw bottles at Chicago police after an officer fatally shot a man on the city's South Side Saturday, prompting the arrest of at least four demonstrators. ### Chicago police patrol chief Fred Waller told a news conference that the man was shot in the South Shore neighborhood after police officers on foot tried to question him because ""the bulge around his waistband"" suggested he was armed. The man became combative and eventually broke free from the officers, Waller said. ### ""They thought he appeared to be reaching for a weapon, which he did have a weapon on him, and the officers tragically shot him,"" he said. ### The unidentified man was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Waller said police believe the man did not have a concealed carry permit for the semi-automatic weapon. He also had magazines of ammunition, Waller said. ### Immediately after the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and began jostling with police, who had cordoned off the area. Waller said protesters threw bottles and jumped on top of a squad car. Police then moved in wielding batons to stop them. ### ___ ### Russian women push back at shaming over World Cup dating ### MOSCOW (AP) - Hundreds of thousands of foreign men have flooded into Russia for the monthlong World Cup, setting off a fierce debate in the host nation about the roles and rights of women. ### Russian women who have dated the soccer fans have been shamed by some Russian commentators, denounced for allegedly undermining the country's morals and gene pool. ### The widespread, vehement criticism has shown the dominance of patriarchal and sexist views in Russia, where the concept of gender equality is a generation behind that of the West's. ### Still, the reaction against Russian women's World Cup dalliances has been so strong that some feminists in Russia think it could actually advance their cause by shocking even conservative women who wouldn't identify themselves as feminists. ### ""Even those women (are saying) 'Enough is enough, you've gone too far!"" feminist writer Snezhana Gribatskaya said. ### ___ ### Haiti's prime minister resigns amid fuel price hike fallout ### PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Haitian Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant resigned Saturday amid calls for him to step down over his handling of a failed plan to raise fuel prices that set off a wave of deadly protests. ### Lafontant told Haiti's Chamber of Deputies that he sent President Jovenel Moise his resignation letter. Moise confirmed via Twitter that he had accepted Lafontant's resignation along with those of other Cabinet members. ### The prime minister's abrupt resignation came ahead of a vote on a motion of censure Lafontant, a first step toward asking that Moise name a new prime minister to form a Cabinet to handle the crisis. The prime minister is the second highest official in Haiti after the president. ### Lafontant was to answer questions about the July 6-8 riots that followed the government's attempt to raise fuel prices by up to 51 percent as part of an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. At least seven people were killed and dozens of businesses were looted during the unrest. ### Instead, Lafontant (LA-FAH-TON) used the opportunity to announce his resignation, while in various parts of Haiti's small protests were held demanding the head of state step down. ### Advertisement"

12903,cnbc.com,2018-07-16T04:40:56-04:00,"2 Hours Ago |  04:15 ### President Donald Trump ’s encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin could be the catalyst for major diplomatic progress over Syria, one expert told CNBC Monday. ### The first official dialogue between the two global leaders will take place in Helsinki’s presidential palace on Monday, marking a symbolic end to the Western effort to isolate Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea. ### Ahead of the summit, neither side has sought to ramp up expectations of the meeting. And most external observers expect Trump and Putin to simply exchange warm words with one another, before potentially agreeing to a tentative deal to start talks on issues such as nuclear arms control and Syria . ### “I think that along with bi-lateral arms control between Russia and the United States, Syria is quite likely today to be one of the top subjects,” Christopher Granville, Russia expert and managing director at TS Lombard, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Monday. ### He explained that since Trump’s election, U.S. and Russian military forces have been working together “pretty closely” in the Syrian theater, marking a “complete change” to the previous Obama administration. ### “So I think there is quite interesting scope for a significant breakthrough,” Granville added. ### What’s going on in Syria? ### The war in Syria has changed dramatically over the last seven years , rapidly morphing into much more than a battle between those who are simply for and against Syrian President Bashar Assad. ### Several countries and groups are involved — each with its own agenda while collectively making the situation extremely complex. Key supporters of Syria's administration include Russia and Iran, while the U.S., Turkey and Saudi Arabia all back government rebels. ### Halil el-Abdullah | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images ### Smokes rise after Assad Regime forces carried out airstrikes in Eastern Ghouta's Douma town in Damascus, Syria on April 07, 2018. ### The United Nations estimates that almost 12 million Syrians have fled their homes since the outbreak of the civil war in March 2011, with the majority seeking refuge in neighboring countries or within Syria itself. ### The pre-war population of Syria was roughly around 22 million people, meaning so far more than half of the country has been displaced. ### Trump-Putin summit expectations ### Officials of the White House and the Kremlin have both sought to downplay expectations ahead of the summit, though Trump has said recently that “maybe some good” could come of the meeting. ### “Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough — that I should have gotten St Petersburg in addition,” Trump said via Twitter on Sunday. ### Chris McGrath | Getty Images ### President Donald Trump and first lady, Melania Trump arrive aboard Air Force One at Helsinki International Airport on July 15, 2018 in Helsinki, Finland. ### The Helsinki summit constitutes the final destination of a nearly week-long European trip for Trump, during which he has frequently challenged traditional Western allies. The U.S. president has sown doubts about America’s commitment to the NATO alliance, reportedly threatened to kill off a future trade deal with the U.K. post-Brexit and described the EU as a “foe” of the world’s largest economy. ### Meanwhile, for Putin, the fact that this summit is happening at all is seen as a geopolitical victory for Russia. That’s because talks between the U.S. and Russia could be viewed by Putin’s inner circle as evidence Washington is finally willing to recognize Moscow as a great power on the international stage."
12909,huffingtonpost.com,2018-07-16T00:41:04-04:00,"Trump And Putin To Hold First Summit Talks As Twitchy West Looks On ### Neither side expects major breakthroughs from the talks in the Finnish capital beyond warm words. ### Steve Holland and Andrew Osborn ### HELSINKI (Reuters) - After months of exchanging long-distance compliments, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin sit down on Monday for their first ever summit, a potential political minefield at home for the U.S. president but a geopolitical win for his Russian counterpart. ### Neither side expects major breakthroughs from the talks in the Finnish capital beyond warm words, an agreement to begin repairing battered U.S.-Russia relations, and maybe a deal to start talks on issues such as nuclear arms control and Syria. ### The two men, who have praised each other’s leadership qualities from afar, could also agree to start restocking their respective embassies and returning confiscated diplomatic property after a wave of expulsions and retaliatory action prompted by the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. ### Ahead of the summit, both sides talked down the event, however, with Trump telling CBS he was going in with “low expectations” and John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, saying on ABC’s “This Week” that the United States was not looking for “deliverables” and that the meeting would be “unstructured.” ### Lehtikuva Lehtikuva / Reuters ### U.S. President Donald Trump arrives in Vantaa, Finland, July 15, 2018. ### Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russia’s RT TV station that he also had low expectations. He would regard the summit as a success if there was an agreement to merely reopen severed lines of communications across the board, he said. ### For Putin, the fact that the summit is even happening despite Russia’s semi-pariah status among some Americans and U.S. allies is a geopolitical win because, in Russian eyes, it shows that Washington recognizes Moscow as a great power whose interests must be taken into account. ### For Russia, it is also a powerful sign that Western efforts to isolate Moscow have failed. ### But for Trump, whose White House victory was actively supported by 12 Russian military intelligence agents, according to a recent U.S. indictment, and whose entourage is still being investigated for possible collusion with Moscow, the meeting is freighted with domestic political risk. ### “We can say confidently that Putin’s political risks are lower than those of President Trump,” said Andrey Kortunov, head of RIAC, a Moscow think-tank close to the Russian Foreign Ministry. ### “Putin has less to lose and more to gain because he does not have a domestic opposition, a potentially hostile legislature, and is not begin investigated like Trump. But if you look at the U.S. media they mostly focus on potential risks. Nobody there really believes that any good can come out of this summit.” ### A probe over allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election has clouded Trump’s presidency. Trump has denied any collusion with the Russians by his campaign and Russia denies it meddled. ### The Helsinki summit is the capstone to a nearly week-long trip for Trump during which he has sown doubts about his commitment to the NATO military alliance, Washington’s so-called special relationship with Britain, and U.S. relations with the European Union that he called “a foe” in trade terms. ### Against that backdrop and swirling uncertainty about what Trump might do or say next, his summit with Putin, which will include a one-on-one session with the Russian leader with only interpreters present, has both U.S. allies and U.S. politicians worried lest he make hasty and sweeping concessions. ### U.S. FEARS ### Some politicians in the West believe the summit is happening at one of the most crucial junctures for the West since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Certain NATO allies fear Putin might seek a grand deal that would undermine the U.S.-led transatlantic alliance. ### Trump has said that he will raise the alleged Russian election meddling with Putin but does not expect to get anywhere, has spoken vaguely about the possibility of halting NATO war games in the Baltic region, and has said repeatedly that it would be good if he could get along with Russia. ### When asked last month if he would recognize Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea, he replied: “We’re going to have to see.” ### On Friday, 12 Russians were indicted on charges of interfering in the U.S. 2016 election, a development that prompted some Democratic leaders to call on Trump to cancel the Putin meeting, a demand he quickly dismissed. ### On the summit’s eve, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, a political opponent of Trump, said he had told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo the Helsinki meeting was a mistake. ### Kevin Lamarque / Reuters ### U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive at Helsinki-Vantaa airport in Vantaa, Finland, July 15, 2018. ### “First, I don’t believe the meeting should take place but if it is going to happen, President Trump must press Putin hard on the issue of election interference. He can’t simply raise it, accept Putin’s denial and then let him off the hook,” Schumer said in a statement. ### “Second, the President must demand that the 12 Russians named in the indictment be sent to the U.S. to stand trial. And third, President Trump should not agree to weaken, lift, or curtail any of the sanctions on Russia.” ### Any Trump request for Russia to extradite hacking suspects is likely to fall on deaf ears, however, as the Kremlin, citing the Russian constitution, has a policy of not handing over suspects wanted by other countries. ### Many Western politicians remain angry over Russia’s annexation of Crimea, its backing of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, and its support for Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. ### Other accusations, denied by Moscow, include that it meddled in European politics, supplied the weapon that shot down a passenger plane in 2014 over Ukraine, and was behind the poisoning of the former Russian spy in Britain. ### Moscow would love to have U.S. sanctions - initially imposed over the Crimea annexation - eased and eventually lifted. But most in Russia do not expect the summit to produce such an outcome. ### (Reporting by Steve Holland and Andrew Osborn, additional reporting by Jeff Mason; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Rosalba O’Brien)"

As president, however, he has shown no desire to confront Putin about Snowden. ### Why not? Experts and former U.S. officials say that passions have cooled over the fugitive who rocked the intelligence community five years ago last month.

And Trump himself has become a harsh critic of U.S. surveillance programs, which he claims without evidence the Obama administration wrongly used against him. ### Even so, some experts think handing over Snowden would be an easy way for Putin to do Trump a favor — giving the president a victory that would especially please intelligence and national security officials angry he hasn’t done more to counter Russian election meddling.

12974,cnn.com,2018-07-15T08:02:57-04:00,"Despite Russia election bombshell, the Trump-Putin show will go on ### Read More ### Just days earlier in Brussels, Trump offered startlingly cutting criticism of one of the closest US allies -- accusing Germany of being ""a captive of Russia"" -- before insisting hours later that he has ""a very, very good relationship with (German Chancellor Angela Merkel)"" and a ""tremendous relationship with Germany."" ### The truth revealed itself in the stiff body language between the two leaders, who did not shake hands for the cameras and appeared miles apart even as they sat just feet from each other. ### But the President's tour-de-grace came during his suddenly announced solo news conference at the end of the NATO summit that sent reporters scrambling to make it into the room on time and wondering whether Trump would announce the US was leaving NATO after reports suggested he had threatened to do so earlier in the day. ### Instead, Trump took to his lectern in the darkly lit room to proclaim that all NATO allies had ""agreed to substantially up their commitment"" to defense spending ""at levels that they've never thought of before."" Despite his insulting and critical comments of close US allies during the summit and his private threats, Trump insisted the alliance was ""very unified, very strong."" ### ""No problem, right?"" Trump said. ### But none of those claims passed muster. As the French President Emmanuel Macron, who maintains one of the most genial personal relationships with Trump of any world leader, made clear soon after Trump's news conference, NATO allies did nothing more than recommit themselves to the previously agreed 2% of GDP defense spending by 2024. ### ""The communique is clear,"" Macron said. ""It reaffirms a commitment to 2% in 2024. That is all."" ### Dueling narratives ### As for the unity of the alliance, the words and images Trump put out to the world signaled anything but the united front lawmakers in Washington and US allies abroad had hoped the US and NATO would project ahead of Trump's summit with Putin in Helsinki on Monday. ### After his blistering criticism of Germany, he and Merkel -- heads of the largest economies in the alliance -- could not have found themselves further apart as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg led the group of world leaders through the cavernous lobby of the alliance headquarters. Merkel found herself in the front, while Trump straggled behind. ### Then there was Trump's late arrival for NATO's second day that only amplified the sense of unease that still lingered in the building after his first day. Just as he had during his similarly tense attendance at the G7 summit in Quebec last month, Trump arrived about 30 minutes late for a working session with his counterparts, confidently striding through the entrance hall were cameras could capture his arrival. ### But which version of reality will Trump project as he meets with Putin in Helsinki? ### Will it be the one of Trump fracturing the alliance that is the strongest bulwark against Russian aggression and undermining his closest counterparts? Or will it be the other version, in which the NATO alliance has been strengthened and the partnership between the US and its close allies across the Atlantic stand united before Putin? ### The US and NATO allies did pledge in Brussels to bolster their defense and deterrence capabilities as a bulwark against Putin -- a notable achievement. NATO allies have also increased defense spending by $33 billion in the last year, which led Trump to ask Friday: ""Do you think Putin's happy about that?"" ### But it's Trump's version of reality on another topic that may come to define his meeting with Putin. ### 'Eyes wide open' ### How Trump's disdain for NATO could help Putin ### US Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman has already asserted that Trump will need to ""go in with eyes wide open"" when he meets with Putin and make ""a sober assessment of the root causes of our problems."" ### ""So what are the underlying causes of past crises?"" Huntsman told reporters last week. ""Dialogue on the true state of the relationship is what is needed."" ### Trump's assessment of the impediments to improving US-Russia relations may not jive with the US government's. ### ""We do have a political problem where you know in the United States we have this stupidity going on. Pure stupidity,"" Trump said in an apparent reference to the special counsel's investigation stemming from Russian meddling in the 2016 election and the surrounding partisanship. ""It makes it very hard to do something with Russia. Anything you do, it's always going to be, 'Oh, Russia, he loves Russia.' "" ### Trump and Putin have displayed a chummy chemistry in their first meetings and Putin's approach to Trump could be key to the summit's outcome. ### The US President has repeatedly shown that flattery, praise and a welcoming atmosphere are the fastest ways to his heart. His comments about May came as he prepared to head to London, where planned protests and criticism from London's mayor awaited his arrival. ### But after May rolled out the red carpet and many of the trappings of an official state visit -- even though it was not one -- and offered glowing remarks about Trump and the US-UK relationship during a gala dinner in his honor, the President appeared to change his tune. A source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN's Michelle Kosinski that Trump's ""eyes lit up"" during May's speech and said the two ""never bonded better."" ### The next morning, after his comments broke, Trump did the unthinkable and offered May an apology. ### But Merkel -- who is known for her awfully revealing poker face -- is still waiting."

( ### Pablo Martinez Monsivais | AP ### By The Associated Press ### HELSINKI (AP) -- President Donald Trump named the European Union as a top adversary of the United States and denounced the news media as the ""enemy of the people"" before arriving in Helsinki on Sunday on the eve of his high-stakes summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin. ### Trump and his top aides were downplaying expectations for Monday's summit as Trump continued to rattle allies by lumping in the EU with Russia and China after barnstorming across Europe, causing chaos at the recent NATO summit and in a trip to the United Kingdom. ### Trump spent the weekend in Scotland at his resort in Turnberry, golfing, tweeting and granting an interview to CBS News in which he named the EU, a bloc of nations that includes many of America's closest allies, at the top of his list of biggest global foes. ### ""I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade,"" Trump said, adding that ""you wouldn't think of the European Union, but they're a foe."" ### He told CBS host Jeff Glor, a Syracuse University graduate and Western New York native, that Russia is a foe ""in certain respects"" and that China is a foe ""economically ... but that doesn't mean they are bad. It doesn't mean anything. It means that they are competitive."" ### Trump has been reluctant to criticize Putin over the years and has described him in recent days not as an enemy but as a competitor. ### On Sunday, Trump flew to Finland, the final stop on a weeklong trip that began last Tuesday. Near Trump's hotel, police roped off a group of about 60 mostly male pro-Trump demonstrators waving American flags. Big banners said ""Welcome Trump"" and ""God Bless D & M Trump"" and a helicopter hovered overhead. ### Chants of ""We love Trump, We love Trump"" broke out as the president's motorcade passed, and Trump waved. ### Trump set expectations for the summit low, telling CBS News, ""I don't expect anything. ... I go in with very low expectations."" His national security adviser said they weren't looking for any ""concrete deliverables."" ### He also said in the interview taped Saturday that he ""hadn't thought"" about asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in Washington on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ### But after being given the idea by his interviewer, Trump said, ""Certainly I'll be asking about it."" ### The U.S. has no extradition treaty with Moscow and can't compel Russia to hand over citizens. Russia's constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens to foreign countries. ### Contradicting Trump in an interview on ABC's ""This Week,"" U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the idea of asking Putin to turn over the 12 military intelligence officials was ""pretty silly"" and argued that doing so would put the U.S. president in a ""weak position."" ### He also argued that Trump is entering the summit with a stronger hand because of the indictments. ### ""I think the president can put this on the table and say, 'This is a serious matter that we need to talk about,'"" said Bolton, adding that asking for the indicted Russians to be turned over would have the opposite effect. ### In the CBS News interview, Trump declined to discuss his goals for the summit -- ""I'll let you know after the meeting,"" he said -- but said he believes such sessions are beneficial. ### He cited his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June as a ""good thing,"" along with meetings he's had with Chinese President Xi Jinping. ### ""Nothing bad is going to come out of"" the Helsinki meeting, he said, ""and maybe some good will come out."" ### From aboard Air Force One, Trump complained in tweets that he wasn't getting enough credit for his meeting with Kim and railed that ""Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people"" as he headed to sit down with Putin. ### Putin is regarded as creating a culture of violence and impunity that has resulted in the killing of some Russian journalists. Trump regularly criticizes American news media outlets and has called out some journalists by name. ### Trump complained: ""No matter how well I do at the Summit,"" he'll face ""criticism that it wasn't good enough."" ### ""If I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough -- that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition!"" he tweeted. ### Trump also praised Putin for holding the World Cup, which finished up Sunday. ### Trump and Putin have held talks several times before. Their first meeting came last July when both participated in an international summit and continued for more than two hours, well over the scheduled 30 minutes. The leaders also met last fall during a separate summit in Vietnam. ### But Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, said Monday's meeting ""is really the first time for both presidents to actually sit across the table and have a conversation, and I hope it's a detailed conversation about where we might be able to find some overlapping and shared interests."" ### Congressional Democrats and at least one Republican have called on Trump to pull out of Monday's meeting unless he is willing to make Russian election-meddling the top issue. Huntsman said the summit must go on because Russian engagement is needed to solve some international issues. ### ""The collective blood pressure between the United States and Russia is off-the-charts high so it's a good thing these presidents are getting together,"" he said during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ### Trump has said he will raise the issue of Russian election meddling, along with Syria, Ukraine, nuclear proliferation and other topics. Bolton described the meeting as ""unstructured"" and said: ""We're not looking for concrete deliverables here."" ### View Comments"

13047,washingtonpost.com,2018-07-16T10:53:52-04:00,"Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events ### Trump is now repaying Putin for helping him win the presidency ### by Greg Sargent July 16 at 10:28 AM Email the author ### (Alexei Nikolsky/Sputnik/Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) ### THE MORNING PLUM: ### The events of the past few days — culminating in President Trump’s meeting today with Russian President Vladimir Putin — have rendered this interpretation inescapable: Trump is currently in the process of repaying Putin for helping to deliver him the presidency. ### Whatever comes of this meeting — even if Trump does, in fact, gain some concessions from Putin, and even if Putin does not get what he wants out of Trump — that storyline will remain operative. The known facts have now established it beyond any reasonable doubt, and the only alternative interpretations of that now-established basic bargain are actually more nefarious than that one. ### In Helsinki today, Trump and Putin spoke to reporters before entering their private meeting. Trump predicted that “I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship,” adding that “getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.” But as The Post’s write-up puts it : “Trump did not mention Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential campaign as one of the topics to be discussed.” ### Last Friday, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III indicted a dozen Russian military intelligence officials for an extraordinary and wide-ranging set of cyberattacks on Hillary Clinton’s campaign and Democratic National Committee officials, alleging a detailed plot to sabotage the election that established the clearest connection yet to the Russian government. Yet not only did Trump fail to say he’d bring up Russian sabotage of our election with Putin, he also tweeted this: ### Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt! ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018 ### In blaming only previous U.S. leadership and the current Mueller probe for bad relations with Russia — and not Russia’s attack on our democracy, which is particularly galling, now that this attack has been described in great new detail — Trump is not merely spinning in a way that benefits himself. He’s also giving a gift to Putin, by signaling that he will continue to do all he can to delegitimize efforts to establish the full truth about Russian interference, which in turn telegraphs that Russia can continue such efforts in the future (which U.S. intelligence officials have warned will happen in the 2018 elections). In a sense, by doing this, Trump is colluding with such efforts right now. ### It has been widely pointed out that Putin benefits from today’s meeting simply because it is happening. As the New York Times puts it , the meeting will be a “success” if it takes place “without any major friction,” which would provide “a symbolic end to Western efforts to isolate Russia over its actions against Ukraine in 2014.” On top of this, of course, all the other actions Trump is taking to destabilize the Western international order — the escalating trade wars, the attacks on NATO that are obviously designed to weaken it — also benefit Putin. ### But the point I want to make here is that, even if you do not view those steps by Trump as a kind of reward to Putin for helping swing the election, since they could be motivated by all sorts of other things, it is unavoidably clear — based on the new information and Trumpian conduct we’ve seen in the past few days — that Trump’s ongoing treatment of Russian electoral interference in particular is essentially a reward for doing just that. Even if Trump does end up taking a tougher line with Russia on international affairs, that point stands, as long as he continues to dismiss the seriousness of the sabotage itself. ### Alternatively, even if you think Trump should be trying for smoother relations with Russia, he could (and should) pair such an effort with genuine condemnation of Russian interference and a serious effort to ward it off in the future, since, after all, what’s at stake is our democracy. Indeed, as the Lawfare team points out , Mueller’s indictment basically reveals that Putin has been lying to Trump all along about the scale and scope of Russia’s sabotage effort. ### But Trump is now shrugging at that confirmed lying, and he’s still not taking this act of sabotage at all seriously. Remember, Trump himself called on Russia to hack Clinton’s emails. And according to a tally by ThinkProgress , Trump publicly drew attention to the material leaked by WikiLeaks — which received it from Russia, according to the Mueller indictment — more than 100 times during the campaign. We don’t know how much influence this sabotage had. But as Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg points out , beyond how many votes were directly moved, the DNC was badly disabled by the cyber subterfuge at a critical moment, which had to have had some kind of serious impact. ### Trump, who himself used the material funneled through WikiLeaks by Russia as a weapon, is in effect now rewarding Russian efforts to supply it, by refusing to treat this sabotage as a crime against our political system. You can, of course, adopt far worse interpretations of what Trump is giving to Putin as part of this basic bargain, and of his motives for doing it. But even if you don’t, this one is now inescapable. ### * A BIG WIN FOR PUTIN: The New York Times reports on all the ways that Vladimir Putin wins simply by getting President Trump to show up for their meeting . And: ### Deploying hackers, disinformation campaigns and support for far-right populist forces in Europe, Mr. Putin has long sought to fracture the West and upend the established geopolitical order. But Mr. Trump, who routinely attacks European leaders and has started a trade war with some of America’s closest allies, is now effectively doing the job for him. ### In addition to this meeting, much of what Trump is doing toward our allies is also “winning” … for Putin. ### * RUSSIAN MEDIA LOVES TRUMP: The Associated Press reports that the Kremlin-friendly Russian media is widely portraying Trump as unfairly maligned in the United States and is praising his meeting with Putin: ### Newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda dismissed the U.S. investigation into Trump’s “mythical work for the Kremlin,” and praised Trump for meeting Putin “despite opposition from his own elite and the hysterics of the media.” … Panelists on popular Sunday night talk show “Vecher,” or “Evening,”  … described him as hobbled … by special investigator Robert Mueller’s probe of alleged Russian election interference. ### Sounds remarkably similar to the message coming from our very own state media, with the exception of the “hobbled” part. ### * RUSSIAN MINISTRY AGREES WITH TRUMP: After Trump blamed bad relations with Russia on previous U.S. leaders and the Mueller probe, and not on Russian behavior or sabotaging of our elections, this happened: ### — MFA Russia 🇷🇺 (@mfa_russia) July 16, 2018 ### No wonder Trump said the meeting with Putin would be the easiest of them all … ### * ALL THE TIMES TRUMP PRAISED PUTIN: CNN tallies up a whole bunch of examples , including his credulous acceptance of Putin’s denial of electoral sabotage, and his claim that he’ll make a “deal” with the Russian leader. CNN comments: ### Trump is drawn to strongmen with a tinge — or more than a tinge — of authoritarianism in their leadership style. There’s a part of him that admires Putin’s ability to command total fealty — and not have to deal with an adversarial (a.k.a. independent) media … What’s clear is that Trump isn’t going to emerge from Monday’s summit … with much to say about Putin that’s negative. ### Indeed, it’s not that hard to imagine Trump emerging with praise for Putin’s relationship with his state media. ### * REPUBLICANS EDGE AWAY FROM TRUMP: Dave Weigel has a good report on Republican candidates who are carefully distancing themselves from Trump’s agenda, even in the hallowed Midwest : ### Doubts about the ongoing tariff battle and about the administration’s agenda on health care, spending and immigration have changed the terrain. Rather than back the president and Republicans, the Midwest has begun to flirt with candidates who would keep them in check. … Republican candidates now are … unable to fully share in the president’s popularity with their own party members but tagged with his least popular moves by general election voters. ### But wait, didn’t Stephen K. Bannon tell us that Republican candidates should fully embrace Trumpism? Seems they don’t agree with the wisdom of that idea. ### * HOW DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING: E.J. Dionne Jr.  talks to Democrats running for Congress in New Jersey and finds they are campaigning on the failures of Trump/GOP rule and the public desire for a check on the president: Note this, from Tom Malinowski, who’s running in the 7th District: ### “We’re now the party of fiscal responsibility in America. We didn’t just add $2 trillion to the national debt for that tax cut that Warren Buffett didn’t want,” he tells me. “We’re the party of law enforcement in America; we don’t vilify the Federal Bureau of Investigation every single day. We’re the party of family values. We don’t … take kids from their parents at the border. We’re the party of patriotism in America that wants to defend this country against our foreign adversaries.” ### Seems like a good argument. Note that he is not shying away from taking on Trump on immigration."

Finland, the host for the summit, and Russia's neighbors in the Baltics, will pay particular attention to any language by Trump on Ukraine, current and former senior European officials tell ABC News. If Trump indicates that the U.S. may now recognize or accept Russia's annexation of Crimea -- perhaps in exchange for Russia's withdrawing its troops from Syria -- that could be seen as giving a green light to Russian aggression, some officials worry.

Add your two cents. ### After a brief delay reportedly caused by President Putin, Trump and his Russian counterpart have gathered for a brief press conference before the start of their 90-minute summit meeting, during which the two men will be left alone to discuss a range of issues. ### *PUTIN: THE TIME HAS COME FOR SUBSTANTIVE BILATERAL TALKS *PUTIN SAYS HE’S BEEN IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH TRUMP ### *TRUMP CONGRATULATES PUTIN ON HOSTING WORLD CUP ### *TRUMP: WILL DISCUSS TRADE, NUCLEAR ISSUES AND CHINA WITH PUTIN ### *TRUMP SAYS AGAIN THAT GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA `A GOOD THING ### The two men shared a handshake, as Trump said “I really think the world wants to see us get along.” ### — Dan Linden (@DanLinden) July 16, 2018 ### But just like with Trump’s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who knows what they will say? ### * * * ### President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrived in Helsinki late Sunday night for his long-awaited summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the Financial Times. And though the two leaders have met before, Monday’s summit will mark the first sit down meeting between the two leaders since Trump’s inauguration. In an interview that aired yesterday, Trump cautioned that he has “low expectations” going into the summit , because no matter what he accomplishes, the media and Trump’s political opponents will treat him like it wasn’t enough . ### Trump said Friday during his press conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May that he expects to discuss Syria, Ukraine and terrorism with Putin. He said later that he would consider asking Putin about the possibility of extraditing the more than two dozen Russians who have now been indicted by the DOJ over allegations of interference in the 2016 election. ### Just hours before meeting with Putin, Trump blamed former President Barack Obama for the so-called Russian interference during the election because Obama knew about the interference but chose to do nothing, and slammed his political opponents for allowing the US’s relationship with Russia to deteriorate to a point where it “has never been worse.” ### President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it.

The question is whether he'll actually score one. ### by Jonathan Allen / ### Jul.15.2018 / 2:57 PM ET ### It's not clear Trump knows precisely what his administration hopes to accomplish in Helsinki.Jack Taylor / Getty Images ### Breaking News Emails ### Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. ### SUBSCRIBE ### HELSINKI — President Donald Trump thinks of himself as the king of the deal, but as he sits down with Russian President Vladimir Putin here Monday, there's scant evidence that he's been able to translate his business-world philosophy into effective bargaining on the international stage or at home. ### Veteran Republican and Democratic national security hands are so worried Trump will be outmaneuvered by the former KGB agent that they are praying that nothing at all comes out of this summit . ### Their concerns are rooted in a foreign policy track record running light in the wins column: so far, the man behind ""The Art of the Deal"" has shown little acumen for making them — but a habit of declaring victory anyway. ### What is President Trump's objective in meeting with Putin? NBC's Chuck Todd weighs in ### Jul.15.201804:12 ### He was so frustrated with his inability to sway the G-7 last month in Quebec City that he abruptly withdrew from a joint declaration agreed upon by the group of like-minded nations and lobbed insults at the host of the conference, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, from the comfort of Air Force One. Here, Trump used the absence of a deal to proclaim victory. ### From there, he traveled to Singapore for a historic summit with Kim Jong-un, the brutal North Korean dictator who craved the global status provided by a meeting with the American president. The two leaders signed off on a vague document outlining a possible future denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, with Trump promising to suspend joint military exercises with South Korea. Again, Trump proclaimed victory. ### Since then, the Kim administration has abandoned talk of denuclearization, upgraded a major nuclear research facility , and stood up U.S. negotiators at a planned meeting to discuss the repatriation of the remains of soldiers killed during the Korean War. ### And at the first stop on his current trip, in Brussels for a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, Trump brandished threats to have the U.S. part ways with NATO and to withdraw U.S. troops from Europe.After an emergency private meeting of the leaders of the trans-Atlantic security group, Trump said he had secured a promise from all the countries to aim to spend 2 percent of their respective gross domestic product totals on their own defense, crediting himself with squeezing allies into compliance — even though that figure represented the exact same goal they've had since 2006. ### As Trump departed for London, and meetings with Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron said the NATO nations, including the U.S., had signed a joint declaration of goals the day before and nothing had changed in the interim. That didn't stop Trump from declaring yet another victory. ### His plan to force the hands of China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union on trade with a new tariff regime have, so far, blown up in his face, with retaliatory actions hurting the bottom lines of many U.S. manufacturers and agricultural producers. Rather than getting China to give in, Trump made a major concession to Beijing soon after negotiations began by lifting sanctions that precluded the Chinese telecom giant ZTE from doing business with American suppliers, despite warnings from Congress, where there is broad bipartisan agreement that the removal of the ban is a threat to national security. ### Even at home, and on his top domestic priority, Trump has failed to cut a deal effectively. He's made no progress with Congress on his promises to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and slash both legal and illegal immigration. That's not just because he can't sway Democrats. Last month, after his aides helped negotiate an immigration bill with House GOP leaders and Trump lobbied fellow Republicans to vote for it, it failed miserably on the House floor. ### While the bill angered Trump's political base, and while that means it was probably in his best interests to see it fall, the episode was yet another reminder that the legend of Trump's prowess at as a negotiator may be just that — a legend. ### Indeed, as Trump prepares to negotiate with Putin, an adversary of the U.S., he so far appears to have given away more than he's gotten. ### Fmr. Amb. to Russia: Trump, Putin meeting ### Jul.15.201806:49 ### And even his trademark unpredictability — ""We have to be unpredictable, and we have to be unpredictable now,"" he said in his first foreign policy address of the 2016 campaign — hasn't exactly proven out. ### If anything, he's followed patterns articulated in his bestselling book, ""The Art of the Deal,"" which was first published in 1987 and is an easy window into Trump's thinking for any ally or adversary who hopes to negotiate with him. ### When Trump thinks he senses weakness in partners, he says he seeks to maximize his leverage by ""having something the other guy wants. Or better yet, needs. Or best of all, simply can't do without,"" as he wrote in his bestselling book ""The Art of the Deal."" ### If he's working without that advantage — negotiating with someone who is in a position of strength — ""leverage often requires imagination, and salesmanship ... you have to convince the other guy it's in his interest to make the deal,"" he wrote. ### That's translated into picking fights with weaker allies, and buttering up American enemies and adversaries. ### ""He is very talented,"" Trump said of Kim following their summit in Singapore. ""Anybody that takes over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and is able to run it and run it tough. I don’t say he was nice or say anything about it. He ran it, few people at that age. You can take 1 out of 10,000 could not do it."" ### Never mind that Kim murdered members of his own family to strengthen his grip on power. Trump, after all, likes his strongmen strong. ### Trump also reserves high praise for Putin, the autocrat who tampered with the 2016 election to help Trump and who says he's developing weapons that can evade Western ballistic-missile defenses. ### ""He is a strong leader,"" Trump told NBC's Chuck Todd in 2015 . ""What am I gonna say, he's a weak leader? He's making mincemeat out of our president."" ### More important, as a former spymaster, Putin is surely aware of another presidential pattern: the way to Trump's heart is through his ego. ### While Putin may not have called Trump ""a genius,"" as Trump has long asserted, he did say then-candidate Trump was ""colorful"" and ""talented"" — certainly enough flattery to turn Trump's head. ### Full Huntsman: 'You don't know what's going to come out of' Trump-Putin meeting ### Jul.15.201808:26 ### Trump said this week that he will raise a number of issues with Putin, including election meddling, Russia's annexation of Crimea and further incursions into Ukraine, nuclear arms control and the situation in Syria. But the American president didn't say how he would like to see those issues resolved. ### So it's not even clear that Trump knows exactly what his administration hopes to accomplish, other than a meeting with a Russian president whose profile on the global stage already has been enhanced by Trump's attention. ### Asked about his goals by CBS, Trump said, ""I'll let you know after the meeting."" ### In the same interview, he said the possibility of asking for the extradition of 12 Russian spies who are charged with hacking into systems of Democrats to help Trump in 2016, hasn't crossed his mind. ### ""I haven't thought of that,"" he said. ""But I'll certainly be asking about it."" ### Then he blamed Obama for letting it happen, even though Trump publicly asked Russia to hack into rival Hillary Clinton's emails on the very day the Russian spies are alleged to have made their first effort — ""after hours"" — to compromise email accounts connected to her personal office. ### There can be little doubt that Putin, who has effectively run Russia for the last 18 years, knows exactly what he wants from the U.S. in Helsinki. ### The question is what Trump is determined to gain: a major deal on the international stage, finally, that concretely benefits the U.S. — or just the chance to give another hollow declaration of victory, and a photo with Putin to commemorate it. ### Breaking News Emails"

13347,washingtonpost.com,2018-07-15T15:33:08-04:00,"Opinion Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events ### Putin must wonder what else America knows about Russia ### by David Ignatius July 15 at 3:19 PM Email the author ### Russian President Vladimir Putin in Qingdao, China, on June 10. (Mikhail Metzel/TASS via Getty Images) ### When Russian President Vladimir Putin sits down at the table in Helsinki on Monday, he will surely have in the back of his mind some intelligence worries that have nothing to do with the U.S. president seated across from him. ### Putin’s elite spy world has been penetrated by U.S. intelligence. That’s the implication of the extraordinarily detailed 29-page indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers handed up by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigators on Friday. The 11-count charge includes names, dates, unit assignments, the GRU’s use of “X-agent” malware, its bitcoin covert funding schemes and a wealth of other tradecraft. ### Putin must be asking himself: How did the Americans find out all these facts? What other operations have been compromised? And how much else do they know? ### “The Russians have surely begun a ‘damage assessment’ to figure out how we were able to collect this information and how much damage was done to their cyber capacity as a result,” says Jeffrey Smith, a former CIA general counsel, in an email. “They are probably also doing a CI (counter-intelligence) assessment to determine whether we have any human sources or whether the Russians made mistakes that we were able to exploit.” ### Must the GRU assume that officers named in Friday’s indictment are now “blown” for further secret operations? Should Russian spymasters expect that operations they touched are now compromised? What about other Russian operations that used bitcoin, or X-agent, or another hacking tool called X-Tunnel? Has the United States tracked such operations and identified the targets? Finally, how are U.S. intelligence services playing back the information they’ve learned — to recruit, exploit or compromise Russian officers? ### “I suspect the senior officers of the GRU who were involved do not have bright futures,” says Smith. “Putin will never extradite them, but it would be great if they were to defect to the U.S. and tell us what they know.” ### Looking at this case through a counterintelligence lens raises an intriguing new series of questions. In putting all the detail into the indictment, Mueller was giving Russian intelligence a hint of how much America can see. But this public disclosure may mask much deeper capabilities — perhaps a capacity to expose many more layers of GRU military-intelligence operations and those by the Russian civilian spy services, the FSB and the SVR. American intelligence agencies rarely tip their hand this way by disclosing so much in an indictment; clearly they did so here to send messages. ### Explains one former CIA officer: “Given that we clearly had so much of the Russian internal communication and cyber footprints, they must be asking what else do we have? Do we have communications between the units and more senior officers in the GRU? With the General Staff? With the Kremlin? With Putin? Probably not the latter directly, but the Russians are very bureaucratic and it’s hard for me to imagine there is not a clear trail of higher level approvals, progress reports, etc.” ### Friday’s indictment is a legal document. But it’s also a shot across the Kremlin’s bow. The message is: If you don’t stop cyber-operations against the United States, we have the detailed information to identify and disrupt your intelligence services, officers, sources and methods. Mueller isn’t asking Russia to stop; he’s warning them of the consequences of going forward. ### The indictment also sends a message to President Trump and members of his entourage who are potential targets of Mueller’s probe: Here’s a hint of what we know; how much are you willing to wager that we don’t know a lot more about Russian contacts and collusion? For example, the indictment is a proffer of Mueller’s information about contacts between GRU cut-out “Guccifer 2.0” and Roger Stone, Trump’s friend and adviser. What else does Mueller have? ### Seeing these details, we have new appreciation for the dilemma of FBI officials James B. Comey, Peter Strzok and the handful of others who saw the unfolding story of Russia’s secret attempt to undermine Hillary Clinton and help Trump. As Strzok put it in his statement to a House committee Thursday: “In the summer of 2016, I was one of a handful of people who knew the details of Russian election interference and its possible connections with members of the Trump campaign.” ### Strzok kept quiet about the conspiracy he was watching. Trump was elected president. But now, at last, with Friday’s indictment, we see a bit of what Strzok and the other intelligence officials saw. ### And here’s a spooky final question: How much has the intelligence community told Trump about its operations against Russia? If you were one of the American intelligence officers who helped gather the information that’s included in Friday’s indictment, what would you think about the fact that Trump has asked for a private meeting first with Putin? ### Read more:"

But coming amid fresh allegations into Russia’s attempts to sway the 2016 election, the sessions on election security have a higher level of urgency and interest. ### Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen speaks to the media. | AP Photo ### Nielsen said her agency will help state and local election officials prepare their systems for cyberattacks from Russia or elsewhere. She said U.S. intelligence officials are seeing “persistent Russian efforts using social media, sympathetic spokespeople and other fronts to sow discord and divisiveness amongst the American people, though not necessarily focused on specific politicians or political campaigns.” ### The conference of top state election officials she addressed was sandwiched between Friday’s indictments of 12 Russian military intelligence officers alleged to have hacked into Democratic party and campaign accounts and Monday’s long-awaited meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### Trump has never condemned Russia over meddling in the 2016 election despite the findings of all top U.S. intelligence agencies, and the Kremlin has insisted it didn’t meddle in the U.S. election. In the past, Trump has reiterated Putin’s denials, but this week he said he would bring up the issue when they meet on Monday in Finland. ### “All I can do is say, ‘Did you?'” Trump said days ago at a news conference in Brussels. “And, ‘Don’t do it again.’ But he may deny it.” ### Some of the state officials who run elections say it’s important for Trump, a Republican, to take a tougher stance to avoid having the public’s confidence in fair elections undermined. ### “I believe as commander in chief he has an obligation to address it and, frankly, put Putin and any other foreign nation that seeks to undermine our democracy on notice that the actions will not be tolerated,” California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said in an interview this week. ### Some of his peers declined to go that far. ### “I don’t go around telling the president what to do,” said Jay Ashcroft, the Republican secretary of state in Missouri. ### Trump portrays the investigation as a partisan attack, but not all Republicans see it that way. This month, the Republicans and Democrats on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee backed the findings of an assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election and acted in favor of Trump and against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. ### As part of that effort, Russian hackers targeted at least 21 states ahead of the election and are believed to have breached the voter registration system in at least one, Illinois, investigators say. Without naming the state, Friday’s indictment said the Russian intelligence officers stole information on about 500,000 voters from the website of one board of elections, a breach undetected for three weeks. ### There’s no evidence results were altered, but the attempts prompted the federal government and states to re-examine election systems and tighten their cybersecurity. ### Federal officials also say it’s possible that malware might have been planted that could tamper with voting or paralyze computer systems in future elections. ### The election officials talked about technical details of blocking an incursion. ### Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican, told her peers how her state is using its National Guard to help test and shore up cybersecurity for elections. She said it’s important to make it clear to voters that the military is not running elections and does not have access to election data. ### “The whole idea of this is to instill confidence in voters and the public that the system is secure,” Wyman said in an interview. ### Some state officials also said Homeland Security is becoming more helpful in sharing information. ### On Friday, a federal grand jury indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers on charges they hacked into Democratic campaign networks in 2016 and then stole and released tens of thousands of documents. The indictment says one of the intrusions came that summer, on a vendor whose software is used to verify voter registration information. The indictment references a spoof email it says the Russian agents sent to more than 100 election-managing customers of the vendor to try to get more information. ### “The indictments tell us that … no longer can we deny in any shape or form that Russians were involved,” said cybersecurity expert Sam Woolley, of the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, California. ### Geoff Mulvihill | Associated Press"

13426,cnbc.com,2018-07-16T07:28:18-04:00,"CNBC.com ### Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images ### US President Donald Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin hold a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, on July 7, 2017. ### As President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin prepare for a head-to-head on Monday, nearby superpower China will be paying the most attention to the relationship dynamic between the two leaders, analysts told CNBC. ### The Trump-Putin summit taking place in Helsinki , Finland, this week “could present China with important strategic opportunities as well as offering valuable lessons for its own relationship with the U.S. president,” John Ferguson, director of global forecasting at analysis firm Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC via e-mail. ### The U.S. president’s hot-and-cold relationship with traditional allies, combined with his willingness to open bilateral dialogues with countries known historically for their rockier relationship with the White House, is an ongoing narrative of his presidency. ### Trump’s potential to cede to Putin on issues such as Russia’s presence in Crimea or NATO’s exercises in the Baltic region could, therefore, set a precedent for Beijing’s furthering of its own geopolitical ambitions, Ferguson said. This includes control over the South China Sea and the sovereignty of Taiwan. ### But, any indication of U.S.-Russian collaboration over denuclearizing North Korea , a country with which both China and Russia share a border, could diminish Beijing’s influence in the ongoing saga. ### “China is a central player in the Korean Peninsula, but if Mr Trump can increase Russian leverage over North Korea, it will lessen his need to rely too heavily on China's support,” Ferguson suggested. ### China ultimately unfazed by Trump-Putin summit ### But while Beijing could be paying attention to Trump’s diplomatic style, it is unlikely to be worried by any developments in U.S. economic and foreign policy, according to two other experts. ### For Kent Kedl, a senior partner at consultancy Control Risks specializing in Asia, Monday’s summit will have little impact on the U.S.-China trade war that is currently roiling markets. Kedl told CNBC via telephone that he did not see the U.S. president trying to rally a coalition against trade adversary China, as “Trump’s way is to divide and conquer.” ### China views Russia as a useful decoy while it serves its own interests, according to Kerry Brown, associate fellow of the Asia-Pacific Programme at think tank Chatham House. “China doesn’t see Russia as a geopolitical threat,” he told CNBC via telephone, but instead views the country as a “useful idiot” whose service is “distracting the West.” ### Though geographically huge, Russia’s economy is dwarfed by the U.S.’ and China’s, which are the world’s largest and second largest respectively. This contributes to Brown’s argument that ultimately, Russia is a “marginal player in U.S.-China relations.” ### But for Ferguson, despite Russia’s only “peripheral” involvement in the ongoing global trade war, American openness to strike deals with Russia could inform China’s own approach. ### Beijing’s own hosting of Trump last November was domestically lauded as a success, indicating that despite trade war worries, it considers itself capable of dealing with the volatile president. ### But, “no-one knows the trajectory after a Trump summit,” Kedl said. ### show chapters"

Timo Jaakonaho/AP hide caption ### toggle caption ### Timo Jaakonaho/AP ### Russian matryoshka dolls depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Trump are on sale in the Ruslania book store in Helsinki. Putin and Trump are scheduled to meet on Monday. ### Timo Jaakonaho/AP ### At last, Donald Trump will get the chance to meet with Vladimir Putin at the formal summit both men have been seeking for months. ### After watching as President Trump held one-on-one talks with leaders from around the world — even North Korea — the Russian president will finally have his American counterpart's undivided attention when they meet on Monday in the Finnish capital Helsinki. ### In the United States, the curious magnetism between the two presidents has fueled speculation about Trump's open admiration for Putin. ### The Russia Investigations: 6 Key Insights From The Cyberspy Indictment ### Special counsel Robert Mueller's indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers for interfering in the 2016 election on Friday would appear to raise the stakes for Trump. But the U.S. president has said he hopes to become Putin's ""friend "" and predicted the summit with "" Putin may be the easiest "" meeting of a Europe trip in which he has lambasted NATO allies in Brussels and faced open hostility in London. ### In Russia, the budding relationship is viewed with cautious optimism as a chance to reboot relations after Putin's military intervention in Ukraine in 2014 set off cascading U.S. economic sanctions. Accusations of Russian interference in the election — which the Kremlin categorically denies — made it politically fraught for Trump to plan a full-fledged summit any earlier. Over the past year, the two leaders have met briefly twice on the sidelines of multilateral gatherings. ### ""The number one priority for Putin is to establish communication with Trump. He certainly wants to understand how, and whether, it's possible to deal with him,"" said Fyodor Lukyanov , the editor of the journal Russia in Global Affairs . ""From the Russian point of view, the absence of such communication is abnormal — insane — when two nuclear superpowers don't talk to each other and the channels of diplomacy are replaced by shouting on social media."" ### U.S.-Russia Summits, From Gravely Serious To Absurdly Comical ### Who wants the summit more is hard to tell. Trump invited Putin to the White House in March , when he congratulated the Russian president on his re-election to a fourth term. That proposal faded into the background after Trump ordered a missile strike on Russia's allies in Syria and then held an even more unexpected meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ### A June visit to the Kremlin by U.S. national security adviser John Bolton — who a year ago accused Putin of lying to Trump about election interference — fixed the time and place of the summit; a week later a Republican congressional delegation to Moscow renewed ties to Russian lawmakers that had been cut since Russia's annexation of Crimea. ### GOP Lawmakers Hope Russia Visit Sets Stage For 'New Day' Ahead Of Trump-Putin Summit ### A report on Russian state television said that, at their last encounter in Vietnam in November, the U.S. president had initially wanted to hold an in-depth discussion with Putin but was ""scared out of it"" by his own advisers; now in Finland Trump is due to get a closed-door meeting without aides. ### Speaking on a talk show on state TV , pro-Kremlin legislator Vyacheslav Nikonov, attributed Trump's success in pushing ahead with the summit to his rising approval ratings at home, especially among Republicans. ""Of course after his meeting with Kim Jong Un, Trump can allow himself anything,"" Nikonov said to applause. ### The consensus view in Moscow is that the summit itself is an accomplishment, given how low U.S.-Russian relations have sunk since President Obama launched his ill-fated ""reset"" with the Kremlin in 2009. ### ""Scoring this reset 2.0 is hugely important since it validates Putin's strategy of staring down the U.S. with zero concessions on policy and no change in Russian posture,"" said Vladimir Frolov, a political analyst in Moscow. ""This will implicitly consolidate his geopolitical gains since 2014."" ### Scoring this reset 2.0 is hugely important since it validates Putin's strategy of staring down the U.S. with zero concessions on policy and no change in Russian posture. ### Vladimir Frolov, political analyst ### Four years ago, Putin occupied and seized Crimea from Ukraine, then backed an armed uprising in the eastern part of the country that continues to today. In 2015, Putin deployed the Russian air force to Syria to prop up the regime in Damascus, transforming himself from international pariah because of the Crimea annexation to a Middle East power broker with direct lines to the leaders of Israel, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. ### In Helsinki, Putin's first objective is to normalize relations with the United States and put the brakes on any new sanctions, Frolov said. A second goal is to give Trump the impression that he is the only Western leader who can get through to Putin. ### ""The more Trump buys into this narrative that getting along with Russia is a good thing, the more he will be under pressure to offer Moscow concessions to maintain the illusion of his triumph in his personal diplomacy with Putin — just like Kim is now milking Trump for all it's worth,"" Frolov said. ### When the two leaders sit down in Helsinki, it will hardly be a meeting of equals, said Alexander Gabuev , a senior fellow at the Carnegie Center Moscow. ### ""Putin is a very skilled negotiator; he controls himself and has depth on many issues that Trump doesn't. So in this regard I think he definitely plays in a different league,"" said Gabuev. ""The problem is that the U.S. is still a very powerful animal in international relations and has much more bargaining power than Russia."" ### In Moscow, Trump's trade wars and tirades against allies are being received with a mix of schadenfreude and trepidation, since any promises he makes to Putin may be subject to the same whimsical implementation — and fierce opposition by the U.S. president's political foes. ### Russian observers agree that the best outcome for Putin is a resumption of dialogue. There are no expectations of breakthroughs on either side, though basic common interests such as preventing a nuclear war or avoiding inadvertent clashes in Syria — where U.S. and Russian troops support opposing sides — are likely to be packaged as results out of Helsinki. ### ""Syria might be a headline because Trump wants it,"" said Gabuev, referring to reports that the U.S. and Israel are urging Russia to curb Iran's military presence in southern Syria. ""I don't know who planted the idea in his brain that you can talk to the Russians and they push the Iranians out."" ### Ukrainian Film Director Stages Hunger Strike In Russian Jail During World Cup ### Iran has fought alongside Russia on behalf of Syrian leader Bashar Assad, but the extent of Moscow's direct influence on Tehran is questionable. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu personally took his case to Putin , who later also received an envoy from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. ### Any way forward in U.S.-Russia relations cannot get around the subject of election interference, which the latest indictments of 12 Russians bring back to the forefront. While Putin initially brushed aside the accusations as part of a domestic political struggle inside the U.S., the Kremlin now appreciates how important the issue is in Washington, said foreign policy expert Lukyanov. ### ""Even if we assume that it happened and Russia was responsible — which very few people here believe — what do we do?"" he said. ""Acknowledge it and say, 'Yes, we did it, but we will not do it anymore?' It's unviable politically, it's not possible."" ### Trump says he will ""firmly"" ask Putin about election interference during the Helsinki summit. ### Putin's challenge will be to come up with an answer that the U.S. president can take back home."

His statements about the Russian have stood in stark contrast to his often harsh and insulting rhetoric toward other world leaders and his political adversaries in both parties. ### The latest from Washington » ### Trump has not tempered his positive tone toward Putin even amid a special counsel investigation into possible collusion by his campaign associates with Russians during the 2016 presidential race. Rather,Trump has blamed the probe, which he has labeled a ""witch hunt,"" for being an impediment to improved relations with Russia. ### Since taking office, Trump has made a pattern of cutting against the grain of his own aides and the U.S. intelligence community on the subject of Russia. In March, Trump ignored a specific warning from his national security advisors not to congratulate Putin on his reelection during a phone call. The Russian election took place in an environment of state-controlled news media and with Putin's most prominent opponent barred from the ballot. ### Advertisement ### On Sunday, he tweeted to congratulate Putin again, this time for hosting the World Cup soccer tournament. ### During an Oval Office meeting last year with Russia's foreign minister, Trump inadvertently revealed classified intelligence from an Israeli source. ### And Trump's consistently strident stance toward NATO allies — he threatened to withdraw from NATO during last week's summit unless other member nations upped their defense spending, and labeled the European Union a trading ""foe"" in a weekend interview — stands to benefit Putin, who views a unified West as the main impediment to his expansionist aims. ### Politics Newsletter"

She said U.S. intelligence officials are seeing ""persistent Russian efforts using social media, sympathetic spokespeople and other fronts to sow discord and divisiveness amongst the American people, though not necessarily focused on specific politicians or political campaigns."" ### The conference of top state election officials she addressed was sandwiched between Friday's indictments of 12 Russian military intelligence officers alleged to have hacked into Democratic party and campaign accounts and Monday's long-awaited meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ### SIGN UP ### Be the first to know. ### No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. ### SIGN ME UP! ### Trump has never condemned Russia over meddling in the 2016 election despite the findings of all top U.S. intelligence agencies, and the Kremlin has insisted it didn't meddle in the U.S. election. In the past, Trump has reiterated Putin's denials, but this week he said he would bring up the issue when they meet on Monday in Finland. ### ""All I can do is say, 'Did you?'"" Trump said days ago at a news conference in Brussels. ""And, 'Don't do it again.' But he may deny it."" ### Some of the state officials who run elections say it's important for Trump, a Republican, to take a tougher stance to avoid having the public's confidence in fair elections undermined. ### ""I believe as commander in chief he has an obligation to address it and, frankly, put Putin and any other foreign nation that seeks to undermine our democracy on notice that the actions will not be tolerated,"" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said in an interview this week. ### Some of his peers declined to go that far. ### ""I don't go around telling the president what to do,"" said Jay Ashcroft, the Republican secretary of state in Missouri. ### Trump portrays the investigation as a partisan attack, but not all Republicans see it that way. This month, the Republicans and Democrats on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee backed the findings of an assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election and acted in favor of Trump and against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. ### As part of that effort, Russian hackers targeted at least 21 states ahead of the election and are believed to have breached the voter registration system in at least one, Illinois, investigators say. Without naming the state, Friday's indictment said the Russian intelligence officers stole information on about 500,000 voters from the website of one board of elections, a breach undetected for three weeks. ### There's no evidence results were altered, but the attempts prompted the federal government and states to re-examine election systems and tighten their cybersecurity. ### Federal officials also say it's possible that malware might have been planted that could tamper with voting or paralyze computer systems in future elections. ### The election officials talked about technical details of blocking an incursion. ### Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican, told her peers how her state is using its National Guard to help test and shore up cybersecurity for elections. She said it's important to make it clear to voters that the military is not running elections and does not have access to election data. ### ""The whole idea of this is to instill confidence in voters and the public that the system is secure,"" Wyman said in an interview. ### Some state officials also said Homeland Security is becoming more helpful in sharing information. ### On Friday, a federal grand jury indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers on charges they hacked into Democratic campaign networks in 2016 and then stole and released tens of thousands of documents. The indictment says one of the intrusions came that summer, on a vendor whose software is used to verify voter registration information. The indictment references a spoof email it says the Russian agents sent to more than 100 election-managing customers of the vendor to try to get more information. ### ""The indictments tell us that ... no longer can we deny in any shape or form that Russians were involved,"" said cybersecurity expert Sam Woolley, of the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, California."

He nodded along to some of Trump’s remarks before they were translated, showcasing his fluency in English. Trump leaned forward in his chair, his hands tented in front of him and frequently glancing over at the Russian president. At one point, he shot Putin a wink. After Trump concluded his remarks, American reporters shouted several questions about whether he would bring up election meddling during his discussions with Putin. ### Most Read Nation & World Stories ### Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. ### Trump did not respond; Putin appeared to smirk. ### With that, the two leaders gave a quick handshake and their private meeting in the opulent Gothic Hall was under way. Just the two of them, each with a translator. ### The summit began just hours after Trump blamed the United States — and not Russian election meddling or its annexation of Crimea — for a low-point in U.S.-Russia relations. The drama was playing out against a backdrop of fraying Western alliances, a new peak in the Russia investigation and fears that Moscow’s aggression may go unchallenged. ### “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse,” Trump tweeted Monday morning, blaming “many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” ### The summit, which was being closely monitored by rattled world capitals, was condemned in advance by members of Congress from both parties after the U.S. indictment last week of 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking Democrats in the 2016 election to help Trump’s presidential campaign. Undeterred, the American president was set to go face to face with Putin, the authoritarian leader for whom he has expressed admiration. ### The summit started late because Putin arrived in Helsinki about a half hour behind schedule in another display of the Russian’s leader famous lack of punctuality. Trump seemed to return the favor by waiting until Putin had arrived at the palace before leaving his hotel. Putin has been late for past meetings with the pope and British queen, among many others. ### Trump and his aides have repeatedly tried to lower expectations about what the summit will achieve. He told CBS News that he didn’t “expect anything” from Putin, while his national security adviser said the U.S. wasn’t looking for any “concrete deliverables.” Trump told reporters during a breakfast Monday with Finland’s president that he thought the summit would go “fine.” ### Trump said he and Putin would discuss a range of issues, from trade to the military, along with missiles and China. Not mentioned: Election meddling or Syria. ### Trump said last week that he would raise the election-meddling issue with Putin, but said he didn’t expect Putin to budge on his denials. ### “I don’t think you’ll have any ‘Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me,'” said Trump, invoking a television detective. “There won’t be a Perry Mason here, I don’t think. But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question.” ### They’ll continue their discussions with an expanded group of aides and over lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor’s throne room. The leaders will conclude by taking questions at a joint news conference. ### Observers have raised concerns about the fact that the leaders will be alone during their first meeting, but for a pair of interpreters, meaning there will be no corroborating witnesses to accurately represent what was said during the conversation. ### The meeting comes as questions swirl about whether Trump will sharply and publicly rebuke his Russian counterpart for the election meddling that prompted a special counsel probe that Trump has repeatedly labeled a “witch hunt.” ### ___ ### Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Ken Thomas and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report. ### ___ ### Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Colvin at http://twitter.com/@colvinj and Isachenkov at http://twitter.com/@visachenkov ### JONATHAN LEMIRE"

Sign up for more newsletters here ### The disconnect is so profound that it often seems Trump is pursuing one Russia policy, set on ushering in a gauzy new era of cooperation with Putin, while the rest of his administration is pursuing another, set on countering a revanchist power that the White House has labeled one of the greatest threats to US security and prosperity. ### As Trump prepares to meet with Putin in Finland, diplomats and former government officials said these contradictions would undermine both the president’s efforts to cultivate a relationship with Putin and his government’s efforts to halt Russia’s campaigns to damage US democratic institutions and bully its neighbors. ### “The president has hobbled his own executive branch, and the executive branch has hobbled its own president,” said Strobe Talbott, a Russia analyst who served as deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration and was president of the Brookings Institution. “It’s a three-legged race with the contestants going in opposite directions.” ### This past week provided a spectacle of crossed signals on Russia. In Europe, Trump disparaged the investigation of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, while in Washington, the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, somberly announced the latest round of indictments in the case. ### Advertisement ### “I call it the ‘rigged witch hunt,’ ” Trump said, as Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain looked on. “I think that really hurts our country and it really hurts our relationship with Russia.” ### A few hours later, Trump’s director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, compared the danger of Russian cyberattacks to the stream of terrorist threats against the United States before Sept. 11, 2001. He said Putin should be held responsible for them. ### In his hawkishness toward Moscow, Coats lines up with other members of Trump’s national security team, from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ### The national security adviser, John Bolton, has publicly encouraged Trump to keep pressing Russia on election meddling, noting that in a preparatory meeting with him, Putin denied Russian state involvement, but not any Russian involvement at all. ### The White House enshrined a tough approach to Russia in its national security strategy, which was written under the direction of Bolton’s predecessor, Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who spoke regularly about the threat Moscow posed to US institutions. ### Advertisement ### The document says Russia and China “are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to enlarge their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence.” ### The administration has imposed sanctions on 213 Russian-related targets, including close associates of Putin, since January 2017, as punishment for Russia’s cyberattacks and its predatory behavior in Ukraine. ### The State Department shut down the Russian Consulate in San Francisco after Russia struck back against sanctions. And it expelled 60 Russian diplomats to retaliate for Russia’s poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil. ### In some respects, it has gone further than the Obama administration. ### In December 2017, the White House approved the sale of lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainian military for its battle against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine — a step former president Barack Obama resisted because he feared it would escalate the confrontation with Russia. ### Trump does not hesitate to take credit for the hard line toward Russia. But he does so in perfunctory language, rarely turning his fire on Putin himself and instead making unfavorable comparisons to his predecessor, Obama. ### “President Obama failed very badly with Crimea,” Trump said Friday when asked about Russia’s annexation. “This was an Obama disaster. And I think if I were president then, he would not have taken over Crimea.” ### On Saturday, while at his golf club in Scotland, Trump blamed Obama for not acting against Russia’s election interference. ### But Trump has also consistently played down Russia’s role in the election, or his obligation to prevent such disruption from happening again. ### Russia’s Foreign Ministry, echoing Trump’s claim of a “deep state” conspiracy behind the special counsel inquiry, said Friday that political forces in the United States that are opposed to a rapprochement had timed the release of the new indictments to “spoil the atmosphere” before the summit. ### Officials in the administration argue that its policies give Trump leverage over Putin. The Russian leader, they said, desperately wants to ease the pressure of sanctions, on his economy, and his cronies. Trump’s promise to modernize the United States’ nuclear arsenal is putting pressure on Putin to seek an arms control treaty to replace New Start treaty. ### Loading comments..."

While Trump speaks fondly of Putin and a desire for better relations with Moscow, the rest of the executive branch remains highly critical and deeply suspicious of the Russian president and Kremlin intentions ### Purchase: Order Reprint ### TURNBERRY, Scotland — President Donald Trump is keeping expectation low for his high-stakes summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin, saying ""nothing bad is going to come out of it, and maybe some good will come out."" ### The president also told CBS News in an interview that he ""hadn't thought"" about asking Putin to extradite the dozen Russian military intelligence officers indicted this past week in Washington on charges related to the hacking of Democratic targets in the 2016 U.S. election. ### But after being given the idea by his interviewer, Trump said ""certainly I'll be asking about it."" ### The United States has no extradition treaty with Moscow and can't compel Russia to hand over citizens. A provision in Russia's constitution prohibits extraditing its citizens to foreign countries. ### The president taped the interview at his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland on Saturday, the day before he was set to leave for Helsinki for the summit. CBS released excerpts on Sunday. ### Trump said he was approaching the Putin meeting ""with low expectations... I'm not going with high expectations."" ### Trump declined to discuss his goals for the summit — ""I'll let you know after the meeting,"" he said — but said he believes such get-togethers are beneficial in and of themselves. ### He cited his historic meeting last month with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as well as meetings he's had with China's Xi Jinping. ### Assessing the Putin meeting, Trump said: ""Nothing bad is going to come out of it, and maybe some good will come out."" ### In the interview, Trump also blamed the Democratic National Committee for ""allowing themselves to be hacked"" by Russians trying to help Trump win the 2016 election."
13992,cnbc.com,2018-07-16T05:46:51-04:00,"3 Hours Ago |  04:15 ### President Donald Trump ’s encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin could be the catalyst for major diplomatic progress over Syria, one expert told CNBC Monday. ### The first official dialogue between the two global leaders will take place in Helsinki’s presidential palace on Monday, marking a symbolic end to the Western effort to isolate Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea. ### Ahead of the summit, neither side has sought to ramp up expectations of the meeting. And most external observers expect Trump and Putin to simply exchange warm words with one another, before potentially agreeing to a tentative deal to start talks on issues such as nuclear arms control and Syria . ### “I think that along with bi-lateral arms control between Russia and the United States, Syria is quite likely today to be one of the top subjects,” Christopher Granville, Russia expert and managing director at TS Lombard, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Monday. ### He explained that since Trump’s election, U.S. and Russian military forces have been working together “pretty closely” in the Syrian theater, marking a “complete change” to the previous Obama administration. ### “So I think there is quite interesting scope for a significant breakthrough,” Granville added. ### What’s going on in Syria? ### The war in Syria has changed dramatically over the last seven years , rapidly morphing into much more than a battle between those who are simply for and against Syrian President Bashar Assad. ### Several countries and groups are involved — each with its own agenda while collectively making the situation extremely complex. Key supporters of Syria's administration include Russia and Iran, while the U.S., Turkey and Saudi Arabia all back government rebels. ### Halil el-Abdullah | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images ### Smokes rise after Assad Regime forces carried out airstrikes in Eastern Ghouta's Douma town in Damascus, Syria on April 07, 2018. ### The United Nations estimates that almost 12 million Syrians have fled their homes since the outbreak of the civil war in March 2011, with the majority seeking refuge in neighboring countries or within Syria itself. ### The pre-war population of Syria was roughly around 22 million people, meaning so far more than half of the country has been displaced. ### Trump-Putin summit expectations ### Officials of the White House and the Kremlin have both sought to downplay expectations ahead of the summit, though Trump has said recently that “maybe some good” could come of the meeting. ### “Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough — that I should have gotten St Petersburg in addition,” Trump said via Twitter on Sunday. ### Chris McGrath | Getty Images ### President Donald Trump and first lady, Melania Trump arrive aboard Air Force One at Helsinki International Airport on July 15, 2018 in Helsinki, Finland. ### The Helsinki summit constitutes the final destination of a nearly week-long European trip for Trump, during which he has frequently challenged traditional Western allies. The U.S. president has sown doubts about America’s commitment to the NATO alliance, reportedly threatened to kill off a future trade deal with the U.K. post-Brexit and described the EU as a “foe” of the world’s largest economy. ### Meanwhile, for Putin, the fact that this summit is happening at all is seen as a geopolitical victory for Russia. That’s because talks between the U.S. and Russia could be viewed by Putin’s inner circle as evidence Washington is finally willing to recognize Moscow as a great power on the international stage."

The indictment, announced on Friday, fleshes out U.S. intelligence agencies’ longstanding conclusion that Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential race. The case provides powerful evidence to rebut skeptics -- including Trump himself at times -- who say Russia may not have had a role. In a news conference, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein described how units of Russia’s GRU intelligence agency stole emails"

Kavanaugh’s confirmation will turn the court to the political right, along with the direction of America. ### Many who did not vote in the presidential election or cast their ballots casually are now crying out at this shift. But both presidential candidates spoke freely about future appointments to the Supreme Court, and this could not be a surprise. ### A president who lost the popular election by 3 million votes, but won 80,000 votes across four critical states that carried the Electoral College, will shape American values for decades. Less than 56 percent of eligible voters turned out in the last presidential election, and fewer than 26 percent voted for the winner. ### It would be easy to dismiss the lamentations of those who sat out the election. No question, they let their side down. But now the stakes are too high to wallow in that. ### The Affordable Care Act remains under constant assault. One of the most effective provisions prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. Without this provision, as many as 130 million adults will face needless suffering and in many cases financial ruin and even premature death ### But the Trump administration has refused to defend this provision against constitutional challenge. By pulling federal government lawyers from the case, it has again signaled its preference for corporate profits over the well-being of average Americans. This will eventually get to the Supreme Court. ### The assault on immigrants continues, both legal and illegal. America’s reputation as a caring haven has been wrecked and replaced with a penchant for heartless cruelty. In the name of toughness, children have been torn from their parents’ arms and families have been destabilized. These issues will get to the Supreme Court. ### In his 1970 State of the Union Address, President Richard Nixon said, “The great question of the ’70s is, shall we surrender to our surroundings, or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land, and to our water?” Later that year, he created the Environmental Protection Agency. ### But the Trump administration has reversed climate-change policies and given industry the upper hand. Now, new policies weaken car and power-plant emission standards, clean-water regulations and carbon-footprint scrutiny. And the United States has withdrawn from the Paris climate accords. Many of these issues will get to the Supreme Court. ### It is too late to stop what is about to happen. That is because elections matter. Those who won paid attention, worked hard and stayed at it. This is their time. ### But nothing is forever in politics, and all who are serious about citizenship can make a difference. Democracy is not complicated, but it is hard work. ### Walk your neighborhood and register voters. Then keep track of them and make sure they vote. There are elections coming up, and they can be won. ### Joseph Sabino Mistick is a Pittsburgh lawyer ( joemistick.com )."
