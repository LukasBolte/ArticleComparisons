1256,gizmodo.com,2018-06-02T09:16:55-04:00,"YouTube Music Isn't Even Close to a Spotify Killer ### Go to permalink ### Screenshot:  YouTube ### After trying and failing to launch a competitive music streaming service for years, Google released YouTube Music last month . You might’ve thought Google’s latest attempt to compete with the likes of Apple Music and Spotify would’ve pushed forward with new ideas. Nope. A quick browse through the app reveals that at the moment it’s simply a lackluster Spotify clone. ### While not exactly billed as such, YouTube is already the most popular music streaming platform on the planet with over a billion users, many of whom use the service as their default way of playing music online. With YouTube Music, the company is desperately trying to convince you to pay for that same access. Lyor Cohen, YouTube’s global head of music, said earlier this year at SXSW that the path to get you on board with subscribing was to “ frustrate and seduce ” with aggressive advertising and limited free functionality. His press tour offered no vision of exciting new features that would make you want to sign-up for another music streaming app. ### When you launch the new YouTube Music app, the opening screen pushes new releases, your own listening history, recommended music videos, and contextualized recommendations based on factors such as location or time of day. Lifting the Spotify aesthetic might have been forgivable if YouTube Music built upon its competition’s feature set, but instead, YouTube brings almost no new ideas to the table. Even YouTube’s curated playlists mimic Spotify: RapCaviar on YouTube is Rap Star Status, Clout Culture becomes Clout Rising, and Viral 50 morphs into Blogged 50. ### Left: Spotify’s mobile app, Right: YouTube Music’s mobile app ### Graphic:  Gizmodo ### YouTube Music’s endless library of music videos is nice, but that isn’t anything new for mobile YouTube users. There are no novel ways to experience the music, and no new possibilities of how songs and videos can interact. Elias Roman, a product manager for YouTube Music, said in an interview with Gizmodo that YouTube is testing a feature that would allow for a seamless transition between songs and videos. That feature may sound enticing, but Roman provided no timeframe for when it might arrive. It’s the kind of idea that could help justify another monthly music subscription fee—a justification YouTube music currently lacks. For now, the service is simply YouTube plus Spotify, which in 2018 isn’t enough. ### Advertisement ### In March, YouTube hired Tuma Basa ,  the man behind Spotify’s most popular playlist, RapCaviar. The hire signaled the company was ready to further invest into curated playlists and content; however a YouTube spokesperson said Basa right now isn’t directly  working on the new streaming service. Although YouTube has done original video with artists like Demi Lavato ,  there is no Apple Music Beats 1 radio-equivalent or any other official   content by known curators and musicians currently on YouTube Music. The lack of an original, curatorial touch—like artist-curated playlists or interviews—makes it harder to justify a YouTube Music subscription. But there is one bright spot that could have won us over: YouTube’s decade-plus supply of user-created material. ### As a music nerd who constantly uses YouTube  to listen to music, this range of diversity is exactly why I often turn to YouTube over Apple Music, Spotify, or any other number of music platforms. The most compelling part of YouTube Music is how the service combines millions of officially licensed songs with remixes, covers, and  many other forms of user-created content. YouTube is full of out-of-print records and DJ mixes that are the exact kind of music that can’t be found on most platforms, like the early rap track “ Funk Box Party 1 "" by the Masterdon Committee. That I can put such niche music on a playlist next to the latest Bruno Mars single is part of what should have been so exciting about YouTube Music. ### Unfortunately, YouTube Music doesn’t yet offer any new ways for users to collect and curate the content that sits on its servers. The browsing and search tools are fairly limited (no decade, genre, or musical style options) and there aren’t any unique ways to approach playlist creation. Google Play, whose users will be folded into YouTube Music, currently lets users upload music to the cloud and play it alongside tracks they stream. Roman told Gizmodo that YouTube Music will also gain that same feature down the line. That’s good news for users who, like me, still clutch their MP3s and want them right beside their favorite videos. ### Advertisement ### Unlike Spotify, which pushes playlists, or Pandora, which creates personalized radio stations, YouTube Music so far doesn’t have an obviously optimal listening experience. The app is too bare bones for someone used to the passive experience of other music streaming apps, and it’s far too featureless for people who would make the most out of YouTube’s vast library. “There definitely [will be] more advanced library management,” said Roman about future collection management options—“for example to sort your library by different criteria like  alphabetically or when it was added.” ### However, the current song categorization options are limited to saving albums and playlists, or liking tracks—neither of which is an efficient way to categorize your favorite music. Frequent YouTube users may not have a problem figuring out what to do, but the service will be unwelcoming to many of YouTube’s billion-plus users who may have otherwise been interested in a new music streaming experience. ### The YouTube Music website ### Screenshot:  YouTube (Google) ### Advertisement ### YouTube made other poor choices. In the new app, mobile background listening is hidden behind a $10-per-month paywall. This effectively makes the free version of the service unusable unless you’re fine with not actually using any features of your phone while listening to music. On desktop, YouTube can get away with this, because you can simply tab over and you aren’t locked to this single screen for music consumption. By contrast, Spotify’s free service allows background listening. Not being to multitask while listening to music undermines the point of the free mobile app. ### There are some features coming down the line that suggest YouTube does understand its users. One of the biggest channels for EDM on YouTube is Trap Nation , but if you search YouTube Music for it today you’d never know that; there is no creators’ page or anything to distinguish people who put effort into curating their channels to promote or support themselves. Roman mentioned that curator and channel-specific pages will come to YouTube Music, but again offered no specific timeframe. It’s just frustrating that such options aren’t already included on the service. ### Broadly, YouTube Music feels like a low-effort attempt to convince you to pay for music on a platform where, for the last decade, you’ve gotten just about everything for free in exchange for watching ads. Given how useless the free version of the app is, it seems the only way YouTube wants users to experience its music service is with a paid subscription. That’s a tough sell, because YouTube Music doesn’t really offer anything you can’t get somewhere else. ### Recommended Stories"

3744,slate.com,2018-06-01T15:06:39-04:00,"The Spotify logo, displayed on a tablet screen in Paris. ### Lionel Bonaventure / Getty Images ### It just got a little more likely to hear R. Kelly on Spotify. The music streaming giant has decided to roll back its recent policy changes regarding hateful content and conduct * after facing backlash from artists and fans. The policy, which was announced May 10, proposed that abusive artists be removed from the site’s editorially curated and algorithmic playlists (think “Today’s Top Hits” and “Your Daily Mix”). The policy stated, “When an artist or creator does something that is especially harmful or hateful (for example, violence against children and sexual violence), it may affect the ways we work with or support that artist or creator.” This policy change led Spotify to remove R. Kelly, XXXTentacion and Tay-K from its playlists. ### But the company has revoked this policy, according to a post published to its blog on Friday. It reads, in part: ### Spotify recently shared a new policy around hate content and conduct … It’s important to note that our policy had two parts. The first was related to promotional decisions in the rare cases of the most extreme artist controversies. As some have pointed out, this language was vague and left too many elements open to interpretation. We created concern that an allegation might affect artists’ chances of landing on a Spotify playlist and negatively impact their future. Some artists even worried that mistakes made in their youth would be used against them. ### That’s not what Spotify is about. We don’t aim to play judge and jury. ### This rollback comes following concerns that revoking publicity for alleged abusers creates a slippery slope. If accusations determine an artist’s status, detractors argued, this could cause a problem in the event that the accusations are not proven true. On the other side of this debate, it could be argued that the original policy was too soft, and that merely removing artists from playlists does little to decrease fan interaction. ### The company adds that the second part of its policy, which “does not permit content whose principal purpose is to incite hatred or violence against people because of their race, religion, disability, gender identity, or sexual orientation,” is still very much in play. This is arguably the more controversial part of their policy, given the company’s slow response to white supremacist artists , and given the fact that I listened to The Manson Family band on Spotify while writing this article. ### Correction, June 1, 2018: This article originally stated that Spotify had rolled back its anti–hate content policy. The company is actually moving away from their policies concerning “hateful conduct.”"

Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Spotify hide caption ### toggle caption ### Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Spotify ### The music streaming service Spotify was both criticized and celebrated for implementing a policy addressing the conduct of artists — a position it rolled back June 1, 2018. ### Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Spotify ### It's easy to imagine the rollout of Spotify's ""hateful conduct"" policy being studied by future students of business as an example of what not to do. On May 16, the leading music streaming service made the bold announcement that it would no longer help raise the profiles of artists whose conduct it deemed particularly egregious, doing so by editing them out of its human-curated playlists and excluding them from its powerful algorithm's suggestions. At the time, Spotify pointed to R. Kelly specifically as the first example of an artist affected by the policy. ### No more. In a blog post on Friday, the company wrote that it doesn't ""aim to play judge and jury"" and is ""moving away from implementing a policy around artist conduct."" Bloomberg News reported Friday that some previously removed artists would be placed back on the platform's playlists, while others (R. Kelly, specifically) would not be. ### Spotify's 'Hateful Conduct' Policy Drags The Music Industry Into The #MeToo Moment ### The policy's announcement last month was met with deep antipathy by the recording industry — in conversations with NPR , executives voiced concern over Spotify punishing artists who had yet to be found guilty via the justice system, regardless of extensive reportage around their behavior. They also wondered what would happen to artists who were found guilty in court, but had since paid their societal debts. ### But at the same time, the move had been celebrated by social justice activists, who praised the company for taking a principled stand in an industry known for its moral opacity. ""Oftentimes, when you're pretending to be agnostic, you're taking a side — you're taking a side that you don't need to take action,"" Heather Cronk, co-director of Standing Up for Racial Justice, told NPR. ### Speaking at Vox Media's Code Conference this week in his first interview since taking the company public and becoming a billionaire (on paper, at least), Spotify's co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek pointed to a cultural disconnect between his home country of Sweden, where his company is based, and the U.S., as well as the company's initial failure to adequately explain the new policy. ""There's too much ambiguity in terms of how people interpreted this,"" he said. ""People thought that they couldn't be on [Spotify], which of course was not the intent."" ### Facebook"

Kelly and other artists from all its playlists and algorithmic recommendations. ### The policy, specifically the one addressing artist conduct, raised concern among musicians because they worried an allegation would hurt their chances at landing on a Spotify playlist and ultimately have a negative impact their careers. ### Related Content ### Spotify has secret weapon ### ""While we believe our intentions were good, the language was too vague, we created confusion and concern, and didn't spend enough time getting input from our own team and key partners before sharing new guidelines,"" Spotify said in a Friday statement. ### The policy had two parts, the company said. One part addressed promoting artists ""in the rare cases of the most extreme artist controversies"" and the other addressed hate content. The policy was implemented May 10. While the music of removed artists, like R. Kelly, would remain on Spotify, the service wouldn't promote that music to its 70 million subscribers. ### R. Kelly has faced persistent allegations of sexual misconduct dating back more than a decade. Most recently, Kelly has been embroiled in controversy since a Buzzfeed article last summer claimed the singer is holding a group of adult women against their will as part of what some of their parents say is a cult. ### Kelly has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. ### Because of the May 10 policy, Spotify said other artists worried mistakes made in their youth would be used against them. ### ""That's not what Spotify is about. We don't aim to play judge and jury. We aim to connect artists and fans,"" the company said. ### The company said it would continue to seek ways ""to impact the greater good and further the industry."" ### Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

Kelly remains off Spotify playlists. The star denies the allegations against him. ### Chief Executive Daniel Ek, speaking at Recode’s Code conference late Wednesday, promised to fine-tune the rules moving forward. ### Spotify’s now-aborted content policy came amid a number of accusations that Kelly ran a violent “sex cult” — while the 20-year-old XXXTentacion has been arrested and charged with aggravated battery of a pregnant woman and witness tampering. ### Spotify’s move to yank the artists from its curated playlists caused an outcry from a number of music’s biggest names — including the rapper Kendrick Lamar — as well as Spotify employees. ### “We rolled this out wrong and could have done a much better job,” Ek said. ### “The whole goal with this was to make sure that we didn’t have hate speech on the service,” he continued. “It was never about punishing one individual. ### “You get into really tricky things such as, ‘Has this person actually been charged with something, convicted with something?’ ” Ek said. “We want to express a lot of diverse opinions. We don’t want to be the judge and moral police of that.” ### It was Ek’s first public appearance since Spotify’s April initial public offering.

Under the new policy, it stopped promoting the music of at least two people: R&B star R. Kelly  and rapper XXXTentacion. The penalty against XXXTentacaion, in particular, drew backlash from big names in hip-hop like Pulitzer Prize-winner Kendrick Lamar and reportedly sparked an outcry  among some of Spotify's own employees. ### Friday, Spotify said that its policy cracking down on hate content remains, but the company will be ""moving away from implementing a policy around artist conduct."" ### Now Playing: Watch this: Free Spotify: Here's what's new ### 1:27 ### ""While we believe our intentions were good, the language was too vague, we created confusion and concern, and didn't spend enough time getting input from our own team and key partners before sharing new guidelines,"" the company said Friday.

Though Kelly was acquitted in a child pornography case in 2008, he's settled numerous lawsuits, and the accumulation of testimonies about his behavior has mounted. ### XXXTentacion is a lesser-known, younger star, who has been charged with crimes like aggravated battery of a pregnant woman and domestic battery by strangulation, but he hasn't been tried nor convicted. ### Under the original policy, Kelly's and XXXTentacion's catalogs remained on Spotify for streaming, but the streaming service itself wouldn't promote their material, crimping their opportunities on what is arguably the most powerful single force in getting an artist's music heard today -- and getting that artist paid. ### Daniel Ek, Spotify's chief executive, conceded Wednesday that the music-streaming service ""screwed up"" how it informed people about the policy and implemented it.

BROWN / AFP/Getty Images) ### Spotify is reversing course after it stopped promoting R. Kelly’s music as part of a controversial new artist conduct policy. ### The music streaming service is “moving away” from its “hate content” and “harmful conduct” policy, which was meant to provide guidelines for Spotify to remove an artist from its curated playlists and recommendation algorithms if their behavior is deemed unacceptable. ### Advertisement ### “Spotify recently shared a new policy around hate content and conduct,” reads an announcement shared Friday to the Spotify website. “And while we believe our intentions were good, the language was too vague, we created confusion and concern, and didn't spend enough time getting input from our own team and key partners before sharing new guidelines. ### “Across all genres, our role is not to regulate artists,” the post continued. “Therefore, we are moving away from implementing a policy around artist conduct.” ### Spotify announced last month that it would not actively promote Kelly’s music after deeming he was in violation of the conduct policy. Kelly is accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women, while the parents of one of his girlfriends, Joycelyn Savage, have claimed their daughter is “brainwashed” and controlled by the singer. ### The streaming service took the same measures with another artist, XXXTentacion, who has faced a series of legal issues, including a 2016 domestic violence arrest for an alleged attack on a pregnant woman. ### Spotify’s move was condemned by reps for both Kelly and XXXTentacion, and it sparked a wider conversation about whether the policy could be considered censorship. ### ""Spotify promotes numerous other artists who are convicted felons, others who have been arrested on charges of domestic violence and artists who sing lyrics that are violent and anti-women in nature,” Kelly’s rep said in a statement at the time. “Mr. Kelly falls into none of these categories, and it is unfortunate and shortsighted that Spotify fails to recognize this."" ### Shortly after Spotify announced its decision, fellow music provider Pandora also stopped promoting R. Kelly’s music. ### Advertisement"

The problem, it seems, is targeting bands and artists who’ve been accused of sexual abuse or assault. The first and only two artists who were affected by the hateful conduct policy were R. Kelly—who is facing increased public scrutiny around his alleged history of having sex with underage girls—and XXXTentacion, who has been charged with aggravated battery against a pregnant woman. ### (At no point were R. Kelly or XXX’s catalogs removed from Spotify; they were merely not featured on any playlists that came from the company.) ### “That’s not what Spotify is about,” the company’s statement further reads. “We don’t aim to play judge and jury.” ### Advertisement ### The decision to stop not promoting artists like R. Kelly—at a time when a campaign like #MuteRKelly is asking his label and other entities who support him to drop the guy—raises the question of how effective it would have been in the first place. Streams of Kelly’s songs went up slightly in the week after his music stopped appearing on Spotify playlists. And #MuteRKelly is asking for repercussions much greater than restricting Kelly’s presence on music streaming platforms; it aims to cut Kelly off from the industry completely. Getting him booted from throwback R&B playlists was never going to help. ### Recommended Stories"

Under the new policy, it stopped promoting the music of at least two people: R&B star R. Kelly  and rapper XXXTentacion. The penalty against XXXTentacaion, in particular, drew backlash from big names in hip-hop like Pulitzer Prize-winner Kendrick Lamar and reportedly sparked a backlash among some of Spotify's own employees. ### Daniel Ek, Spotify's chief executive, now says the implementation of the policy, especially in regard to Kelly, could have been handled better. ### ""I think we rolled this out wrong and could have done a better job communicating it,"" Ek said Wednesday during an on-stage interview at Recode's Code Conference , which is taking place this week in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.  ""The goal for this was to make sure we didn't have hate speech on the service. It was never about punishing one individual."" ### ""What we wanted to be was just transparent,"" Ek said.

Though Kelly was acquitted in a child pornography case in 2008, he's settled numerous lawsuits, and the accumulation of testimonies about his behavior has mounted. ### XXXTentacion is a lesser-known, younger star, who has been charged with crimes like aggravated battery of a pregnant woman and domestic battery by strangulation, but he hasn't been tried or convicted on those charges. ### While Kelly's and XXXTentacion's catalogs remain on Spotify for streaming, and you can listen to or playlist any songs you like by them, the streaming service itself said it wouldn't be promoting their material on what is arguably the most powerful single force in getting an artist's music heard and getting that artist paid. Spotify reportedly has told music industry figures it will eventually resume putting XXXTentacion music on playlists . ### Ek was contrite about how his company has dealt with the situation and he's looking at how it could have been better handled. ### ""We screwed up,"" he said.

The Swedish music service has updated its ‘Hateful Conduct’ rules by effectively walking the entire idea back. ### The policy that was announced in May resulted in the removal of the artists R. Kelly, Tay-K, and XXXTentacion from the company’s playlists, immediately sparking intense pushback from the music industry. Spotify acknowledged that it didn’t do its due diligence when enacting the policy, saying : ### [While] we believe our intentions were good, the language was too vague, we created confusion and concern, and didn’t spend enough time getting input from our own team and key partners before sharing new guidelines. ### This statement itself is a little confusing. Within the company, Billboard reported that some executives had already questioned the decision explicitly because of the kind of backlash that could arise. So, Spotify may well have known this policy could’ve backfired the way it did. Troy Carter, Spotify’s global head of creative services, was rumored to be heading out of the door because of this choice, but last we heard he currently remains at the company. ### Spotify CEO Daniel Ek even admitted the policy was “ rolled out wrong ” earlier this week. Perhaps next time Spotify, a company valued at over $25 billion, will listen a bit more closely to those internal and external voices when making such industry-shaking decisions."
