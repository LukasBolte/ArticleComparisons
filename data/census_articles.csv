Maybe Because Nobody Is Holding CBP Accountable. ### In February, attorneys challenging North Carolina’s legislative gerrymander notified the defendants, a group of Republican leaders in the legislature, that they’d issued a subpoena. The lawyers had asked Stephanie Hofeller Lizon to provide “any storage device” containing redistricting-related documents left by her estranged father, Thomas Hofeller, a Republican consultant who specialized in gerrymandering. Republican legislators did not object, and Lizon turned over the requested materials: 18 thumb drives and four hard drives containing more than 75,000 files—many related to her father’s consulting work. The voting rights attorneys had uncovered a vast trove of information exposing the inner workings of GOP gerrymandering across the country. ### Upon learning what their opponents had obtained, attorneys for Republican lawmakers went to court to try to seize the files. But it was too late. Voting rights advocates had lawfully acquired the materials, even after having given Republicans a chance to object. And on Thursday, they dropped the first bombshell from Hofeller’s hard drives: A key portion of a 2015 memo written by Hofeller appeared in a draft Justice Department letter used to justify the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the census. Hofeller’s memo, which explains why the citizenship question would boost the voting power of “Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites,” indicates that administration officials lied about the reason for adding the question. ### There are sure to be more revelations from the Hofeller files to come, driving home the downside of using a single consultant to mastermind redistricting across multiple states and decades. ### There are sure to be more revelations from the Hofeller files to come. ### For years, Hofeller held an office at the Republican National Committee on Capitol Hill. He worked as both its official redistricting director and, later, as a paid consultant. He traveled the country to teach Republican lawmakers how to gerrymander their districts to create permanent GOP legislative majorities. (Ironically, he incorporated warnings about keeping all of this work under wraps, like “Make sure your security is real,” “Make sure your computer is in a PRIVATE location,” and “The ‘e’ in email stands for ‘eternal.’ ”) Hofeller also personally helped to draw some of the country’s most egregiously gerrymandered maps, including those in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. (He likely had a hand in more maps than we currently know.) But Hofeller devoted the most time to North Carolina, where he created lopsided Republican majorities in a state evenly divided between the parties. ### Following the 2010 red wave, Hofeller worked with the RNC to develop Project REDMAP , a sweeping initiative to help GOP-controlled state houses build durable gerrymanders. He taught lawmakers how to use racial and partisan data to dilute Democratic votes. His maps preserved Republicans’ House majority over the next three elections and maintained GOP domination over most state legislatures. ### Now Hofeller’s records are in the hands of attorneys for Common Cause, the voting rights group suing to invalidate North Carolina’s Hofeller-designed legislative gerrymander. The firm representing Common Cause, Arnold & Porter, also represents plaintiffs fighting the citizenship question—which is how Hofeller’s white voting power memo wound up before the judge overseeing the census case. (On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union also brought it to the Supreme Court’s attention.) ### The voting rights advocates in possession of the Hofeller collection have not yet revealed the full extent of the files. This may be because they have been exceedingly careful to play by the rules: Lizon offered her father’s drives to Common Cause directly, but its attorneys decided to issue a subpoena in February to obtain them formally and provide notice to third parties. ### Phil Strach, attorney for the Republican legislators in the North Carolina case, did not object to that subpoena at the time that notice was provided. At a hearing in April weeks after declining to challenge the subpoena, however, Strach attempted to block Common Cause’s attorneys from viewing the records they already had in their lawful possession. As Melissa Boughton reported at the time , Strach told Wake County Superior Court that he wanted the documents returned to Hofeller’s estate and implied that Lizon procured them improperly. Hofeller’s widow, Kathleen, expressly permitted Lizon to take the materials—but Strach claimed that Kathleen has been institutionalized and may not have been sufficiently competent to provide consent. (Stanton Jones, an Arnold & Porter attorney representing Common Cause, told the court that Kathleen has not been declared incompetent.) The court ignored Strach’s pleas, instead simply directing Common Cause’s attorneys to let the Republican defendants copy the Hofeller drives, pursuant to state law. ### Strach is not done fighting, though. At the April hearing, he said he believed the drives contain “Hofeller’s privileged work from many, many states over years and years.” He suggested that the files probably include “attorney client workload products” that may be privileged. It seems Republicans will attempt to limit voting rights advocates’ ability to use the Hofeller materials by raising a slew of objections. ### But Hofeller was not an attorney, and the vast majority of his files are unlikely to be privileged. While Arnold & Porter and Common Cause have been, as noted, exceedingly careful not to overstep any legal bounds, they almost certainly have every right to examine Hofeller’s materials and use them in litigation. And if Strach is correct that drives encompass work “from many, many states over years and years,” progressives will have hit a gold mine. Racial gerrymandering is generally illegal , and Hofeller’s work might include smoking guns proving that maps relied on impermissible racial data. Moreover, while the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet outlawed partisan gerrymandering, state Supreme Courts , including North Carolina’s, are moving in that direction . Hofeller’s files may contain more proof that legislators drew districts along partisan lines. ### In July, attorneys for Common Cause and North Carolina Republicans will face off at a trial over Hofeller’s partisan gerrymander of the state’s legislative districts. Voting rights attorneys will now likely be armed with data from Hofeller’s own hard drives, ready to pierce the secrecy of GOP redistricting. It will not be the last time the consultant’s materials are used to tear down the gerrymanders he spent his life perfecting. "

Indeed, in a decade or less, we may look back at this time as the era in which the court lost any imprimatur of judicial independence. ### The court’s upcoming decision as to whether the Department of Commerce can add a question about citizenship to our national census will provide us with some important tea leaves for determining whether the current court is becoming the handmaiden of conservative politicians. The court is expected to rule by the end of June. ### New evidence suggests that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross’ decision to add a citizenship question to the census had everything to do with helping Republicans and harming Democrats. These revelations mostly confirm what many observers had long suspected about the true motivations of the Commerce Department. What is more surprising — and revealing — is the fact that none of this is likely to matter to the Supreme Court. ### These revelations mostly confirm what many observers had long suspected. What is more shocking is the fact that none of this is likely to matter to the Supreme Court. ### The legal issues of the case may sound mundane, but the political stakes are huge. The U.S. Constitution says that Congress must count how many people live in our country. The census, conducted by the Department of Commerce, determines the number of representatives in the House, the distribution of electors in the Electoral College, and the amount of federal funding each state gets. While the commerce secretary is in charge of the census, he or she cannot engage in activities that are arbitrary and capricious. And yet, that is just what Secretary Wilbur Ross has done. ### In 2017, Ross disingenuously claimed that the Department of Justice had suggested that the Department of Commerce add a citizenship question to the census to help in enforcing the federal Voting Rights Act. But the idea to add the citizenship question appears not to have originated with the Department of Justice and has nothing to do with enforcing voters' rights. Meanwhile, many experts believe that adding a citizenship question to the census will lead people in immigrant-heavy areas, including legal and illegal immigrants, to not respond. This inaccuracy is why career experts in the Department of Commerce unanimously recommended that the citizenship question not be included. ### Smoking gun evidence of Trump's push to rig the census ### May 31, 201906:37 ### This is not a minor issue. The Census Department itself estimates that as many as 6.5 million people could not be counted as a result of adding the citizenship question. And it is not a coincidence that the majority of these 6.5 million people live in areas dominated by Democrats. In fact, we now know, that is in fact the whole point. ### Recently discovered documents on the computer of now-deceased Republican operative and redistricting expert Thomas Hofeller indicate that the idea to add the citizenship question actually originated with him, not the Department of Justice. His goal was not to help the Department of Justice enforce the Voting Rights Act, but rather to use this information to allow states to draw legislative district lines based not on the total population, but instead on the number of eligible voters. This would, he wrote, help “Republicans and non-Hispanic whites,” and would clearly hurt Democrats. ### The newly unearthed documents do not tell us more than what many already strongly suspected, but they do bring into stark relief why the Trump administration is so determined to add the citizenship question, and how they have lied about it. ### During oral arguments in April , the conservative members of the court appeared ready to accept at face value the Department of Commerce’s assertion that the citizenship question will be added to help enforce the Voting Rights Act. It is worth remembering that the conservative wing of the court has not been particularly concerned about the Voting Rights Act in the past. In fact, just six years ago it struck down a key portion of the act designed to protect voters from discriminatory voting laws. ### Since that 2013 decision, states and localities throughout the nation have enacted laws burdening the right to vote . States have, for instance, reduced or eliminated early voting, reduced the number of voting centers, purged voter rolls, and implemented stringent voter identification requirements. This was an entirely predictable consequence of the court’s decision. ### More recently, a slim conservative majority of the court voted to uphold an Ohio law that took voters off the voter rolls if they failed to both vote in one election and respond to a postcard asking them to confirm their address. The court couched its language in the need to protect the integrity of the electoral process, but the truth is that Ohio’s law disproportionately affects the ability of poor and minority voters to vote. And again, not coincidentally, those people are disproportionately Democrats. ### The idea that Ross wants to add the citizenship question to the census to help enforce the Voting Rights Act is a farce, which every court to rule on this issue has recognized. ### In other words, the conservative wing of the court has shown no concern about the Voting Rights Act. And the idea that Ross wants to add the citizenship question to the census to help enforce the Voting Rights Act is a farce, which every court to rule on this issue has recognized. ### Three lower federal courts have ruled that the Department of Commerce can not add a citizenship question to the census, at least under these circumstances. They all agreed that Ross failed to put forward valid reasons for the addition of the question. ### The three lower courts were right. The Supreme Court appears ready to undermine its legitimacy by ignoring reality and context and overturning those decisions. ### If this sounds familiar, it is because the court did the same thing last year when it ruled to uphold President Donald Trump’s travel ban . Despite numerous statements by both candidate Trump and President Trump that the purpose of the ban was to bar Muslims from entering the country, the court ignored reality, ignored context, and just looked at the words on the page of Trump’s third try at implementing a travel ban. ### This is looking less and less like an ideological battle between conservative and liberal judges and more like a Supreme Court controlled by partisan politicians in robes. And the census ruling could prove it. ### Jessica Levinson ### Jessica Levinson is a professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles.

They did not ask the Supreme Court to take any specific action. ### The plaintiffs, which include the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee and Make The Road New York, learned of Hofeller's role after his files came to light in separate litigation in North Carolina in which Republican-drawn electoral districts are being challenged. ### A Justice Department representative said the allegations were a ""last-ditch effort to derail the Supreme Court’s consideration of this case."" ### ""The Department looks forward to responding in greater detail to these baseless accusations in its filing on Monday,” the person said. ### Manhattan-based U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman blocked the question's inclusion following the trial, but the Supreme Court appeared poised to overturn that ruling at April's oral argument. ### According to Thursday's filing, Hofeller concluded in a 2015 study that asking census respondents whether they are U.S. citizens ""would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats"" and ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites"" in redistricting. ### Hofeller went on to ghostwrite a draft letter from the U.S. Department of Justice to the Department of Commerce, asking for a citizenship question on the grounds it would help enforce voting rights, according to the plaintiffs. ### The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, said that administration officials gave false testimony about the origin of the question during the lawsuit, and have asked Furman to consider imposing unspecified sanctions against them. ### Furman has scheduled a hearing on the request for June 5. ### Reuters reported in April that the Trump administration believed its citizenship question could help Republicans in elections by enabling states to draw electoral maps based only on citizen population, rather than total population. ### Opponents have said a citizenship question would cause a sizeable undercount by deterring immigrant households and Latinos from filling out the census forms, out of fear the information would be shared with law enforcement. That would, they argue, cost Democratic-leaning areas electoral representation in Congress and federal aid, benefiting President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans and Republican-leaning parts of the country. ### (Reporting by Brendan Pierson and Andrew Chung in New York; Additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Tom Brown and Lisa Shumaker) ### What to Read Next"
967,beforeitsnews.com,2019-05-31T07:13:40-04:00,"Census Citizenship Question Pushed for by GOP Gerrymanderer ### Thursday, May 30, 2019 20:09 ### % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents. ### Any fair reading of the public record since 2017 has suggested that the Trump administration, despite inconsistent protestations to the contrary (whether in front of Congress or in the courtroom ), has sought to re-insert on the decennial census form in 2020 a question about citizenship status for the express political purpose of undercounting heavily Democratic areas, thereby decreasing these areas’ representation in Congress. ### Now comes news , via a court filing Thursday, that a recently deceased GOP gerrymandering specialist not only wrote a 2015 analysis of how Republicans would benefit if political maps were drawn based on voting-age U.S. citizenry rather than overall population, he also helped ghostwrite a 2017 Department of Justice letter to the Commerce Department (which manages the census), requesting the reinstatement of the citizenship question on the highly dubious grounds that it would improve enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. ### Thomas Hofeller, who The New York Times describes as having achieved “near-mythic status in the Republican Party as the Michelangelo of gerrymandering,” died last August at age 75. His estranged daughter, Stephanie Hofeller, when sorting through dad’s affairs, “came across a clear plastic bag holding four external hard drives and 18 thumb drives, backups of data on Mr. Hofeller’s Toshiba laptop.” In a series of implausible-sounding coincidences, she reportedly happened to mention in passing the existence of some gerrymandering-related material on those drives to a lawyer who happened to work for Common Cause, which happened to have an active lawsuit in North Carolina court about gerrymandering. ### One thing led to another, and the files have now been presented to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York, who ruled against the administration’s citizenship question in January. That case has been appealed and is awaiting a Supreme Court ruling. It is unclear whether the Hofeller trove will affect the case. ### The original purpose of the census, as spelled out in the Constitution, is to count the “Number of free Persons” living in each state for the purpose of apportioning seats in the House of Representatives. The post-Civil War amendments to the Constitution redefined that whole “free Persons” bit: “Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.” ### As Matthew J. Franck has explained at National Review , “voting rights are not and never have been the relevant consideration in counting population for congressional representation. Like women in most states before the Nineteenth Amendment, and like minor children even today, the alien is counted because he is represented in Congress, even if he cannot participate in electing members of it.” This has been the governing system ever since, upheld in various ways by the Supreme Court . ### Republican immigration restrictionists have been chafing at that legal reality since at least the 1980s. When Sen. David Vitter (R–La.) in 2009 introduced a bill mandating that the census reinsert the citizenship question for the first time since 1950, he was explicit in his aims: “States that have large populations of illegals,” Vitter complained , are being unfairly “rewarded.” That view is shared by many within the Trump administration orbit, most notoriously the populist svengali Steve Bannon and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach . ### Hofeller was initially hired in 2015 to provide potential analytical ammo in Evenwel v. Abbott , a case in which two Texas voters attempted to challenge the Lone Star State’s residency-based political apportionment, arguing that the political power of legal citizens was unfairly diluted by the counting of non-legal residents. (The Supreme Court decided unanimously, if narrowly, in 2016 against that argument, with Justice Samuel Alito remarking along the way that “The decennial census required by the Constitution tallies total population.”) ### Hofeller concluded in his study that redrawing Texas political boundaries based on voting eligibility “would be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.” But such voter data was not available on a granular basis, he lamented. “Without a question on citizenship being included on the 2020 Decennial Census questionnaire,” Hofeller wrote, “the use of citizen voting age population is functionally unworkable.” ### The New York Times picks up the timeline from there: ### Roughly 16 months later, as President-elect Trump prepared to take office, Mr. Hofeller urged Mr. Trump’s transition team to consider adding a citizenship question to the census, the transition official responsible for census issues, Mark Neuman, said last year in a deposition in the Manhattan census lawsuit. ### Mr. Neuman testified that Mr. Hofeller told him that using citizenship data from the census to enforce the Voting Rights Act would increase Latino political representation — the opposite of what Mr. Hofeller’s study had concluded months earlier. ### Court records show that Mr. Neuman, a decades-long friend of Mr. Hofeller’s, later became an informal adviser on census issues to Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. By that summer, a top aide to Mr. Ross was pressing the Justice Department to say that it required detailed data from a census citizenship question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act. ### It’s worth pausing to reflect on the brazenness here. Hofeller writes up a study showing that redistricting based on voter eligibility—which by the way is unconstitutional—would definitely help Republicans and whites while hurting Democrats and Latinos in high-immigrant states. He then complains that the best compilation of that data—the annual American Community Survey, which asks the citizenship question and is the primary information source used for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act —is not a thorough survey, but a mere sampling of around 3.5 million households nationwide. In order to produce the desired outcome for Republicans, at the expense of Latino households, he writes, you’d need the citizenship question asked by the decennial census. ### The Trump administration then claims with a straight face that the primary purpose of restoring that question is to better enforce the Voting Rights Act. ### While that clumsy lie was smacked down already by Judge Furman (and in these pages by Jacob Sullum ), Thursday’s court filing adds a new wrinkle to the mendacity. In a Hofeller document dated Aug. 30, 2017, the Voting Rights Act rationale was spelled out in a paragraph, complete with supporting court decisions. According to the Times, “That paragraph later appeared word for word in a draft letter from the Justice Department to the Census Bureau that sought a citizenship question on the 2020 census.” A later letter clearly drew on Hofeller’s 2015 study, the Times found. ### Hofeller is not the only GOP gerrymanderer who attempted to influence Trump’s census. The president’s first pick for deputy director and operational executive of the Census Bureau was Thomas Brunell, author of the 2008 book,  Redistricting and Representation: Why Competitive Elections Are Bad for America . Brunell’s name was later withdrawn  after an outcry. ### So what’s wrong with the census including a citizenship question, since after all it was included in the “long form” of the questionnaire as recently as 2000? I’ll turn the floor over to Jacob Sullum : ### The Constitution requires an “actual enumeration” of each state’s population, without regard to citizenship or immigration status, every 10 years so that representatives can be apportioned correctly. Asking about citizenship, which the main census form has not done since 1950,  undermines that goal , since people may worry that the information they provide will be used against them or their relatives—a fear for which there is  historical precedent , notwithstanding the government’s promise of confidentiality. ### Since 1960 the Census Bureau and the commerce secretary have warned that a citizenship question would aggravate the undercounting of “hard-to-count” groups, including not just unauthorized residents but people who live with them. Last January bureau staff conservatively estimated that adding the question would cause a 5 percent drop in form completion by noncitizen households. ### Remarkably, Commerce Secretary Ross has stated on the record that an undercount of the one thing the census was specifically tasked with would nonetheless be worth it in return for all that crucial Voting Rights Act information. “Even if there is some impact on responses … the citizenship data provided to [the Department of Justice] will be more accurate with the question than without it,” Ross wrote in a memo last year, “which is of greater importance than any adverse effect that may result from people violating their legal duty to respond.” ### Trump administration officials have repeatedly demonstrated that they are willing to lie in order to depress the counting of immigrant households. We should know in a matter of weeks whether they’ll get away with it."

WEBER and GEOFF MULVIHILL - Associated Press ### FILE - In this May 1, 2018, file photo, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton speaks at a news conference in Austin, Texas. Computer files discovered in the home of Tom Hofeller , a Republican operative who died last year, contain a blueprint for how the GOP could extend its domination of legislatures in states where growing Latino populations favor Democrats and offer compelling context about a related case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. Many of the state's top Republicans, including Paxton, have publicly expressed support for a citizenship question on the Census. SHOW MORE SHOW LESS (Nick Wagner/Austin American-Statesman via AP, File,) ### AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Computer files discovered in the home of a Republican operative who died last year contain a blueprint for how the GOP could extend its domination of legislatures in states where growing Latino populations favor Democrats and offer compelling context about a related case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. ### The files from North Carolina redistricting expert Tom Hofeller include detailed calculations that lay out gains Republicans would see in Texas by basing legislative districts on the number of voting-age citizens rather than the total population. But he said that would be possible only if the Census asked every household about its members' immigration status for the first time since 1950. ### The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on that question as early as next month. But Republicans who support adding the citizenship question have rarely acknowledged any partisan political motive. The emergence of the documents now could figure heavily in the case the court is considering. ### To civil liberties lawyers suing to block the question, it's now clear that partisan politics were at work all along. They assert in court filings that Hofeller not only laid out the political benefit for the GOP but also ghost-wrote a U.S. Department of Justice letter calling on the Census Bureau to add an immigration question to next year's survey. ### The Justice Department denied the allegations in a statement on Thursday, saying Hofeller's Texas analysis ""played no role in the Department's December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census."" In that 2017 letter, Justice said it needed citizenship information to protect the voting rights of minorities. ### The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the citizenship question in April and is expected to rule by July whether it will be allowed. ### ""What it would result in is outrageously overpopulated and underpopulated districts,"" said Matt Angle, a Democratic redistricting strategist, adding that the resulting maps would harm Texas' booming Hispanic population with the aim of benefiting Republicans. ### Many of the state's top Republicans, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , have publicly expressed support for a citizenship question on the Census. On Friday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's office did not respond to questions about whether he would endorse using citizenship data to draw new maps, although a spokeswoman said last year that the Census question would provide greater transparency and was dismissive of fears of under-reporting. ### Opponents contend that many noncitizens and their relatives will shy away from being counted, fearing that law enforcement will be told of individuals' citizenship status. That could cause undercounts in places with large Latino populations, including parts of Texas, California, Florida and Arizona, and could cost them seats in Congress as well as federal funding. ### But the political impact of the citizenship question could go beyond an undercount if states use citizenship information to draw the maps for state legislative districts. The concept was introduced in legislation over the last few years in Missouri and Nebraska, where the state constitution already calls for excluding ""aliens"" from its apportionment. And Alabama has sued the federal government saying it should supply citizenship information. ### In Texas, Hofeller calculated in his report that about a half-dozen Latino-dominated districts would disappear, including a portion of one in the Dallas area, up to two in Houston's Harris County and two or three in the border counties of South Texas. ""A switch to the use of citizen voting age population as the redistricting population base for redistricting would be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,"" he wrote. ### There's a question of whether the switch would be legal. ### The U.S. Constitution specifies that congressional districts should be based on how many people — not citizens — live there. But it's murkier for many state legislative districts. ### The case at the heart of Hofeller's 2015 report was brought by Texas voters who contended it was unfair that noncitizens and minors were counted in making legislative districts because it gave a bigger voice to a smaller number of eligible voters in places with a lot of noncitizens and children. In response, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that states could not be forced to use voting-age citizens as the basis for districting. ### Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with that decision but wrote a separate opinion that seems to invite states to do it on their own. ""It instead leaves states significant leeway in apportioning their own districts to equalize total population, to equalize eligible voters, or to promote any other principle consistent with a republican form of government,"" Thomas wrote. ### If a state tried to use a limited population count for redistricting, a lawsuit would be likely. ### ""They're always trying to argue that only citizens should be counted for drawing the lines. They think it's to their advantage,"" said Luis Vera, a San Antonio-based lawyer for the League of United Latin American Citizens who has spent decades in court with the state over redistricting battles and said he'd sue if Texas switched to citizen-based districts. ### Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said lawmakers may be reluctant to change which count is used for redistricting knowing they'd face legal challenges. ### He said that even if a switch could be approved under a state constitution, it could run afoul of the federal Voting Rights Act, which bars state and local governments from restricting equal voting access based on race. ### But Rogelio Sáenz, a sociologist at the University of Texas-San Antonio, said he expects it will be considered in Texas, where Democrats picked up 12 seats in the House last year, now giving them 67 of the 150. ### ""The Republican Party is really anxious to gain back those few seats they lost in the last election,"" Sáenz said. ### ___"

What is more surprising — and revealing — is the fact that none of this is likely to matter to the Supreme Court. ### These revelations mostly confirm what many observers had long suspected. What is more shocking is the fact that none of this is likely to matter to the Supreme Court. ### The legal issues of the case may sound mundane, but the political stakes are huge. The U.S. Constitution says that Congress must count how many people live in our country. The census, conducted by the Department of Commerce, determines the number of representatives in the House, the distribution of electors in the Electoral College, and the amount of federal funding each state gets. While the commerce secretary is in charge of the census, he or she cannot engage in activities that are arbitrary and capricious. And yet, that is just what Secretary Wilbur Ross has done. ### In 2017, Ross disingenuously claimed that the Department of Justice had suggested that the Department of Commerce add a citizenship question to the census to help in enforcing the federal Voting Rights Act. But the idea to add the citizenship question appears not to have originated with the Department of Justice and has nothing to do with enforcing voters' rights. Meanwhile, many experts believe that adding a citizenship question to the census will lead people in immigrant-heavy areas, including legal and illegal immigrants, to not respond. This inaccuracy is why career experts in the Department of Commerce unanimously recommended that the citizenship question not be included. ### Smoking gun evidence of Trump's push to rig the census ### May 31, 201906:37 ### This is not a minor issue. The Census Department itself estimates that as many as 6.5 million people could not be counted as a result of adding the citizenship question. And it is not a coincidence that the majority of these 6.5 million people live in areas dominated by Democrats. In fact, we now know, that is in fact the whole point. ### Recently discovered documents on the computer of now-deceased Republican operative and redistricting expert Thomas Hofeller indicate that the idea to add the citizenship question actually originated with him, not the Department of Justice. His goal was not to help the Department of Justice enforce the Voting Rights Act, but rather to use this information to allow states to draw legislative district lines based not on the total population, but instead on the number of eligible voters. This would, he wrote, help “Republicans and non-Hispanic whites,” and would clearly hurt Democrats. ### The newly unearthed documents do not tell us more than what many already strongly suspected, but they do bring into stark relief why the Trump administration is so determined to add the citizenship question, and how they have lied about it. ### During oral arguments in April , the conservative members of the court appeared ready to accept at face value the Department of Commerce’s assertion that the citizenship question will be added to help enforce the Voting Rights Act. It is worth remembering that the conservative wing of the court has not been particularly concerned about the Voting Rights Act in the past. In fact, just six years ago it struck down a key portion of the act designed to protect voters from discriminatory voting laws. ### Since that 2013 decision, states and localities throughout the nation have enacted laws burdening the right to vote . States have, for instance, reduced or eliminated early voting, reduced the number of voting centers, purged voter rolls, and implemented stringent voter identification requirements. This was an entirely predictable consequence of the court’s decision. ### More recently, a slim conservative majority of the court voted to uphold an Ohio law that took voters off the voter rolls if they failed to both vote in one election and respond to a postcard asking them to confirm their address. The court couched its language in the need to protect the integrity of the electoral process, but the truth is that Ohio’s law disproportionately affects the ability of poor and minority voters to vote. And again, not coincidentally, those people are disproportionately Democrats. ### The idea that Ross wants to add the citizenship question to the census to help enforce the Voting Rights Act is a farce, which every court to rule on this issue has recognized. ### In other words, the conservative wing of the court has shown no concern about the Voting Rights Act. And the idea that Ross wants to add the citizenship question to the census to help enforce the Voting Rights Act is a farce, which every court to rule on this issue has recognized. ### Three lower federal courts have ruled that the Department of Commerce can not add a citizenship question to the census, at least under these circumstances. They all agreed that Ross failed to put forward valid reasons for the addition of the question. ### The three lower courts were right. The Supreme Court appears ready to undermine its legitimacy by ignoring reality and context and overturning those decisions. ### If this sounds familiar, it is because the court did the same thing last year when it ruled to uphold President Donald Trump’s travel ban . Despite numerous statements by both candidate Trump and President Trump that the purpose of the ban was to bar Muslims from entering the country, the court ignored reality, ignored context, and just looked at the words on the page of Trump’s third try at implementing a travel ban. ### This is looking less and less like an ideological battle between conservative and liberal judges and more like a Supreme Court controlled by partisan politicians in robes. And the census ruling could prove it. ### Jessica Levinson ### Jessica Levinson is a professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles.

4738,washingtonpost.com,2019-05-31T07:50:25-04:00,"Email Bio Follow ### May 30 at 2:44 PM ### To hear President Trump’s administration tell it, the 2020 Census needs to include a question about residents’ citizenship because it would aid enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Few experts think that such a question is needed for that purpose, mind you, and few people think that’s the administration’s motivation. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court appears to be poised to determine that the question can remain on next year’s national survey, accepting the administration’s rationale. ### That likelihood will probably not be affected by the discovery of remarkable documents that kneecap the White House’s argument. On Thursday, we learned that a Republican consultant who had argued for such a question had done so explicitly because he understood that it would help his party politically. ### The Washington Post’s Tara Bahrampour explained the discovery: ### The evidence, found in the files of the prominent Republican redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller after his death last August, reveal that Hofeller “played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census in order to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, ‘Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,’” and that Trump administration officials purposely obscured Hofeller’s role in court proceedings, lawyers for plaintiffs challenging the question wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman. ### Hofeller had been evaluating Texas’s legislative districts and determined that narrowing the population that was considered for the purposes of districting to voting-age citizens would aid Republicans in the Lone Star State. In other words, instead of drawing district boundaries based on the population of the state, he advocated using a narrower pool of individuals that would effectively force Democratic districts to be drawn larger to include enough residents — reducing the number of districts in heavily Democratic areas. ### To effectively implement that plan, though, he needed better data about the number of citizens. Ergo: a question on the census. ### The question itself probably will have much the same effect on Democratic districts, some experts say. It is likely to dampen responses from largely Hispanic and immigrant communities, places that often vote more heavily Democratic. ### Limiting the considered population pool to adult citizens would sharply reduce the number of people included in federal and state districting efforts. On average, about a quarter of the residents of each state would no longer be included in the population used for such analysis. Census Bureau citizen estimates suggest that the percentage of residents excluded would range from a 35.8 percent drop in Texas to a 20.3 percent drop in Maine. ### (Philip Bump/The Washington Post) ### Why such a large difference? Because Texas has a much larger density of Hispanic residents. About 57 percent of those who would be excluded from Texas’s count are Hispanic, both because the Hispanic population in the United States tends to be younger than other groups and because the state has many Hispanic noncitizens. California would experience a similar drop. ### (Philip Bump/The Washington Post) ### The percentage of non-Hispanic whites that would be excluded nationally is 20.2 percent. The percentage of Hispanics? More than half, 51.1 percent. ### That lopsidedness is one reason the political effect in Texas would be uneven. ### Hispanics vote more consistently Democratic than do whites. Most of the congressional districts nationally in which a shift to counting only adult citizens would yield the largest drop are ones that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Generally, that’s a function of the size of the Hispanic population in the district. ### Of Texas’s 36 districts, the 10 that would be most affected by a shift to counting only adult citizens backed Clinton. The 15 that would be affected the least by that change voted for Trump. ### (Philip Bump/The Washington Post) ### We can look at the political effects of this in another way. If this concept were expanded nationally to the extent that electoral votes were allocated solely on the basis of the adult citizen population in each state, the effect would be a decline of four votes in blue states — driven by a decline of five votes in California — and a gain of four in red states. That’s a swing of eight votes to the GOP. ### (Philip Bump/The Washington Post) ### Shifts like these were apparently the point of Hofeller’s work. He recognized that by identifying the number of citizens across the country, he and his party could advocate for a rules change that benefited Republicans politically. ### For understandable reasons, that’s not the message the Trump administration wanted to promote. ### Most Read Politics"

Furman on Thursday, the challengers say the evidence bolsters their argument that while the administration contends the question was added to better comply with federal voting laws, the real reason was to intimidate Hispanic households from being counted. ### ""The new evidence thus not only contradicts testimony in this case, but it shows that those who constructed the VRA (Voting Rights Act) rationale knew that adding a citizenship question would not benefit Latino voters, but rather would facilitate significantly reducing their political power,"" the letter to the judge reads. ### The Justice Department called the challengers' allegations ""baseless,"" saying the consultant's study ""played no role"" in the decision. ### A department spokesperson said Thursday night: ""That study played no role in the Department's December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census. These unfounded allegations are an unfortunate last-ditch effort to derail the Supreme Court's consideration of this case. The Department looks forward to responding in greater detail to these baseless accusations in its filing on Monday."" ### Hofeller died last August. ### Furman ruled against the administration in January, holding that Commerce Secretary William Ross' decision to add the question was unlawful for a ""multitude of independent reasons"" and must be set aside. He said the decision to add the question violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the way agencies can establish regulations. ### Most critically, Furman who sits on the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, said Ross' stated rationale for the question -- to promote the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act -- was ""pretextual -- in other words that he announced his decision in a manner that concealed its true basis."" ### The Supreme Court agreed to take up the appeal in an expedited time frame and heard arguments in April. In court, the conservative justices appeared ready to side with the government and allow the question. ### In the letter to Furman, the lawyers attached a copy of a deposition of A. Mark Neuman, who they say was Ross' expert adviser on the matter. ### He testified that Hofeller was the ""first person"" who suggested to him to add the citizenship question. Neuman said in the deposition that Hofeller had told him it would help maximize ""Latino representation."" ### ""But new evidence obtained in discovery in state court... shows that Dr. Hofeller instead knew that adding a citizenship question would have exactly the opposite effect—it would disadvantage Latinos and benefit ""Non-Hispanic Whites,"" the lawyers told the judge. ### They also say that Hofeller ""ghostwrote"" a ""substantial part"" of a draft letter that would ultimately become the Department of Justice's official letter requesting that Commerce add the citizenship question. ### ""This is important because it shows that Hofeller's work formed the basis for DOJ's request to add the citizenship question,"" said ACLU attorney Dale Ho. ### The information came to light after Hofeller had passed away and his estranged daughter collected his belongings. They included a hard drive which turned out to hold some 75,000 files. The interest group Common Cause was involved in a case concerning gerrymandering in North Carolina and subpoenaed the documents hoping to get a better understanding of Hofeller's work in that area. They then found the documents pertinent to their other case concerning the census case. ### Richard Hasen, of the University of California Irvine, called the new information ""blockbuster"" but he said he doubted the conservative justices on the Supreme Court would agree. He noted that during oral arguments they accepted at ""face value"" the administration's justification for the law, that the question was ""necessary to protect Hispanic voters."" ### The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

6146,washingtonpost.com,2019-05-31T18:20:17-04:00,"May 31 at 3:41 PM ### This week, the hood came off. ### The Trump administration has devised a fundamentally racist policy : adding a question to the 2020 Census that will suppress participation by nonwhite people and, therefore, artificially increase white (and Republican) power in a new round of gerrymandering. ### To do this, administration officials falsely told the public, the lower courts and the Supreme Court that the disadvantage to nonwhite Americans was statistically questionable and that the Justice Department needed the change to enforce the Voting Rights Act . ### But documents released this week prove this all to be a ruse. Officials lied about their motives. ### The documents, from the files of the late architect of the plan, show that this gerrymandering expert (Thomas Hofeller, whose role the Trump administration did not disclose to the courts) authored a 2015 study saying his scheme (to use voting-age citizens for redistricting rather than total population) would require a “radical redrawing” of legislative districts that would “be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.” This “would clearly be a disadvantage for the Democrats,” he wrote , packing Democratic voters into fewer districts and “strengthening the adjoining GOP districts.” ### He warned that Latino voters would perceive it as “an attempt to diminish their voting strength.” Hofeller proposed laundering the idea by having the Justice Department claim it needed the citizenship question for voting-rights enforcement, and he wrote the framework of the request that the department eventually sent. ### The Trump administration’s top lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, told the Supreme Court in April that voting-rights enforcement was “ the principal benefit ” of the proposed change. That was false. The “principal benefit,” we now see, is to increase white power. In my column about the Supreme Court argument in April , I wrote that “it is difficult not to be cynical” about the administration’s true motive. Now, the racist policy is spelled out in black and white. ### This is shocking but not surprising. We tend not to realize how much of the president’s appeal is about race. Studies show the primary indicator of support for Trump isn’t economic insecurity but racial resentment . This doesn’t mean Trump supporters are torch-carrying racists; it means they fear losing their place. Racial tension has fueled our tribal partisanship, as party becomes a proxy for race and racial views. ### This is largely why the daily mayhem of the Trump presidency has no discernible effect on support for Trump: not the petty (the White House ordering John McCain’s name covered on a Navy ship); not the ludicrous (the Energy Department rebranding liquid natural gas “molecules of freedom”); not the insidious (Trump continuing to allege a “Russian hoax” and his own innocence after special counsel Robert Mueller demonstrated otherwise); not the ugly (Trump resisting disaster aid for Puerto Rico for months, and GOP lawmakers this week blocking the legislation ); and not the inhuman (migrant children held illegally, and dying, at the border). All of this pales against the existential threat to traditional white America from what it perceives as nonwhite interlopers. ### Some version of this has always been with us. “The very idea of being American has from the start been defined negatively by who could be classified as not-American,” writes my friend Eric Liu in his important new book, “ Become America ,” a collection of “civic sermons.” In the 18th and 19th centuries, the right to vote “was about earning a badge that a black person (and, for a long stretch, a Chinese person) could never earn: the badge of citizen, first-class.” Now we see a new variant, with Latinos and Muslims. ### People assume Trump’s “Make America Great Again” notion is about a return to the halcyon 1950s. “But it turns out we had the decade wrong,” Liu writes. “It was in the 1920s — after mass immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. . . . that the [Ku Klux] Klan came back strong, that nativists took over the United States government, and that a nakedly racist system of immigration quotas and exclusion became the law.” ### The difference now is that, in as soon as a quarter century, white Americans will no longer be the majority . This needn’t be a loss for white people — immigration isn’t zero-sum — but Trump’s GOP has convinced followers it is. Therefore, preserving white power becomes essential, and the citizenship question buys time. ### It is a fundamentally dishonest undertaking, as we saw this week. Francisco, the solicitor general, had told the Supreme Court that “the Department of Justice’s letter is the one that articulated the Voting Rights Act rationale” of the new policy. We now know the Justice Department letter was ghostwritten by an expert who made the citizenship question the linchpin of a well-researched scheme to increase white voting power. ### The Supreme Court has a few weeks left to decide whether to endorse the Trump administration’s lie in the service of racism."
6190,startribune.com,2019-05-31T18:53:48-04:00,"Purchase: Order Reprint ### AUSTIN, Texas — Computer files discovered in the home of a Republican operative who died last year contain a blueprint for how the GOP could extend its domination of legislatures in states where growing Latino populations favor Democrats and offer compelling context about a related case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. ### The files from North Carolina redistricting expert Tom Hofeller include detailed calculations that lay out gains Republicans would see in Texas by basing legislative districts on the number of voting-age citizens rather than the total population. But he said that would be possible only if the Census asked every household about its members' immigration status for the first time since 1950. ### The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on that question as early as next month. But Republicans who support adding the citizenship question have rarely acknowledged any partisan political motive. The emergence of the documents now could figure heavily in the case the court is considering. ### To civil liberties lawyers suing to block the question, it's now clear that partisan politics were at work all along. They assert in court filings that Hofeller not only laid out the political benefit for the GOP but also ghost-wrote a U.S. Department of Justice letter calling on the Census Bureau to add an immigration question to next year's survey. ### The Justice Department denied the allegations in a statement on Thursday, saying Hofeller's Texas analysis ""played no role in the Department's December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census."" In that 2017 letter, Justice said it needed citizenship information to protect the voting rights of minorities. ### The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the citizenship question in April and is expected to rule by July whether it will be allowed. ### ""What it would result in is outrageously overpopulated and underpopulated districts,"" said Matt Angle, a Democratic redistricting strategist, adding that the resulting maps would harm Texas' booming Hispanic population with the aim of benefiting Republicans. ### Many of the state's top Republicans, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , have publicly expressed support for a citizenship question on the Census. On Friday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's office did not respond to questions about whether he would endorse using citizenship data to draw new maps, although a spokeswoman said last year that the Census question would provide greater transparency and was dismissive of fears of under-reporting. ### Opponents contend that many noncitizens and their relatives will shy away from being counted, fearing that law enforcement will be told of individuals' citizenship status. That could cause undercounts in places with large Latino populations, including parts of Texas, California, Florida and Arizona, and could cost them seats in Congress as well as federal funding. ### But the political impact of the citizenship question could go beyond an undercount if states use citizenship information to draw the maps for state legislative districts. The concept was introduced in legislation over the last few years in Missouri and Nebraska, where the state constitution already calls for excluding ""aliens"" from its apportionment. And Alabama has sued the federal government saying it should supply citizenship information. ### In Texas, Hofeller calculated in his report that about a half-dozen Latino-dominated districts would disappear, including a portion of one in the Dallas area, up to two in Houston's Harris County and two or three in the border counties of South Texas. ""A switch to the use of citizen voting age population as the redistricting population base for redistricting would be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,"" he wrote. ### There's a question of whether the switch would be legal. ### The U.S. Constitution specifies that congressional districts should be based on how many people — not citizens — live there. But it's murkier for many state legislative districts. ### The case at the heart of Hofeller's 2015 report was brought by Texas voters who contended it was unfair that noncitizens and minors were counted in making legislative districts because it gave a bigger voice to a smaller number of eligible voters in places with a lot of noncitizens and children. In response, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that states could not be forced to use voting-age citizens as the basis for districting. ### Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with that decision but wrote a separate opinion that seems to invite states to do it on their own. ""It instead leaves states significant leeway in apportioning their own districts to equalize total population, to equalize eligible voters, or to promote any other principle consistent with a republican form of government,"" Thomas wrote. ### If a state tried to use a limited population count for redistricting, a lawsuit would be likely. ### ""They're always trying to argue that only citizens should be counted for drawing the lines. They think it's to their advantage,"" said Luis Vera, a San Antonio-based lawyer for the League of United Latin American Citizens who has spent decades in court with the state over redistricting battles and said he'd sue if Texas switched to citizen-based districts. ### Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said lawmakers may be reluctant to change which count is used for redistricting knowing they'd face legal challenges. ### He said that even if a switch could be approved under a state constitution, it could run afoul of the federal Voting Rights Act, which bars state and local governments from restricting equal voting access based on race. ### But Rogelio Sáenz, a sociologist at the University of Texas-San Antonio, said he expects it will be considered in Texas, where Democrats picked up 12 seats in the House last year, now giving them 67 of the 150. ### ""The Republican Party is really anxious to gain back those few seats they lost in the last election,"" Sáenz said. ### More from Star Tribune"
6644,npr.org,2019-05-31T06:50:39-04:00,"NY Times correspondent Adam Liptak talks about how Trump's two appointees might change the court — including its direction on abortion: ""It's not hard to write a decision striking down Roe,"" he says. ### TERRY GROSS, HOST: ### This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The Supreme Court will soon wrap up its first term with two sitting justices appointed by President Trump - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. One of the big questions about this new court is, will it strike down Roe v. Wade or continue to allow states to chip away at women's access to abortion? ### My guest Adam Liptak is the Supreme Court correspondent for The New York Times. We're going to talk about the direction of the court on issues pertaining to abortion and the Trump administration, and we'll examine how Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are changing the court. ### Adam Liptak, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Let's talk about how the right to have an abortion is being challenged in the Supreme Court. And let's start with a case that was decided this week. Describe the law that had been struck down and was appealed to the Supreme Court. ### ADAM LIPTAK: The law had two pieces. One piece said you can't have an abortion if you're doing it for a bad reason. And among those reasons were that the fetus has a disability or you wanted to choose the sex of a child. So that's part one of the law. Part two of the law tells abortion providers that they have to dispose of fetal remains by burying or cremating them. ### GROSS: So how did the court decide? ### LIPTAK: The court decided not to review the ruling on the forbidden grounds part of the law. It let stand a lower court ruling that struck down that law as contrary to Roe v. Wade, which, in essence, says the states can't ban abortions until viability - until the fetus is viable outside the womb. So it declines review in the forbidden grounds part of the law. ### On the other hand, on the more modest part of the law on disposal of fetal remains, the court reverses the lower court and says that law is acceptable. But it says, at the same time, it's not really an abortion law. We're not analyzing it under abortion precedents. We're just saying a state is entitled to have such a law. Just as it could tell, say, a veterinarian how to dispose of the bodies of animals that died, it can tell abortion providers how to dispose of fetal remains. ### GROSS: One of the things that really confuses me about the law that was overturned, the law that said that a woman can't decide to have an abortion based on choosing what gender she wanted to have or deciding to have an abortion because the fetus was diagnosed as having Down syndrome or another, you know, serious illness or abnormality - if a woman says, I'm having an abortion just 'cause I want to, who's to say that she's having it because she's choosing the gender? Who's to say she's having it because the fetus was diagnosed with Down syndrome? I mean, how can you know what's in a woman's heart when she decides to have an abortion? ### LIPTAK: Right. And that goes to a point about many of these laws. They're symbolic, in a way. They'd be very, very hard to police. What woman is going to announce that - in the face of such a law, that she's aborting a fetus because of Down syndrome? It's also a curious law that says, sure, you can have an abortion on a whim. You just can't have it for an expressed reason that a lot of people might think was a sound reason. ### GROSS: If the Supreme Court had heard the case, the part of the case pertaining to selectively having an abortion based on gender - the gender or the health of the fetus - would've given the court the first chance to consider the constitutionality of a state law restricting abortion since Kavanaugh replaced Kennedy last year. Do you think that the conservative members of the Supreme Court are just waiting for a better case to challenge Roe? ### LIPTAK: No. My sense is that the court would rather move more cautiously and uphold more modest restrictions on abortion, rather than go headlong into the question of overruling Roe v. Wade. And there are a lot - so there are two kinds of abortion laws in the land. Some of them make it hard for women to get an abortion - laws about admitting privileges and waiting periods. ### And I think the court is likely to take those kinds of cases, uphold the restrictions and make it harder for women - particularly women in red states, particularly poor women in red states - to get abortions, but is not particularly eager, in the next year, two, five, to headlong go into, is Roe v. Wade ready to be overturned? I - the court will get there, quite likely, but I don't think it's in a rush. ### I think Chief Justice Roberts is not a friend of Roe, but is also an incrementalist, an institutionalist - wants to protect the legitimacy and prestige of his court and wants to move slowly. He's only 64 years old. He's got plenty of time. ### Now, that does mean he needs to reign in the justices to his right. Three of them seem ready to move. And that places the newest justice, Justice Kavanaugh, in an important position because although it takes five votes to decide a case at the Supreme Court, it only takes four votes to put the case on the docket. And if four justices do put a big abortion case on the docket, there's - it's not at all clear that at that point, forced to decide, Chief Justice Roberts will vote to sustain Roe. I think, more likely, he'd vote to strike it down. ### GROSS: So voting it onto the docket is a really big issue right now. And you say it's really Kavanaugh who's going to be deciding that. What do we know about Kavanaugh's record on the right to abortion? ### LIPTAK: On the appeals court, he participated in a decision in which it looked like he doesn't have a lot of use for Roe v. Wade. But he, too, at least in his early time on the court - and he's only been there for, you know, several months - has exhibited a kind of caution and there - and has voted closely with the chief justice, has been in the majority more than any other justice, doesn't seem to want to get out of the gate, particularly following his stormy confirmation hearings, doing something truly radical. So I think he, too, will be inclined to move slowly. ### But, you know, as you say, Terry, it only takes the four votes. And if Kavanaugh were to join the three more conservative justices - Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch - to put the case on the docket, the court could well overturn Roe v. Wade. ### GROSS: So what are the cases most likely to come to the Supreme Court because they were designed to be test cases? ### LIPTAK: My sense is - so we're seeing these abortion laws all over the country. Seemingly every week, there's a new one. And they - and you know, Alabama says, you can't have an abortion at all, including if you were raped or the victim of incest, and wants to impose very harsh prison terms on doctors who perform abortions. Other states have these so-called fetal heartbeat laws, which effectively ban abortion at six weeks, a point in time when many women don't even know that they're pregnant. ### Those cases, those outright bans on abortion that flatly conflict with Roe, are very likely to be struck down by lower courts. They really ought to be struck down by lower courts because lower courts are supposed to apply Supreme Court precedent, and Supreme Court precedent requires them to be struck down. Then the question is, does the Supreme Court simply deny review? - which is what it does routinely in the vast majority of cases. Ninety-nine percent of cases, the court simply denies review - or do we reach a point at which there are four votes to put such a case on the docket? ### Again, I don't think that's going to happen particularly soon. I think the court will instead engage in a project of hollowing out the right to abortion by sustaining all kinds of restrictions on abortion, but is not really looking for a headline - a banner headline in the New York Times that says Supreme Court 5-4 overrules Roe v. Wade. It would rather do it a little more cautiously and incrementally. ### GROSS: So if the Supreme Court is unlikely to overturn Roe v. Wade, it sounds like it might be more likely to overturn Casey, the 1992 decision? Do you want to explain that decision and where that figures in to where we're headed on abortion rights? ### LIPTAK: In a sense, Roe and Casey do the same thing, but Casey introduces a new test on abortion laws, and it's a very squishy test. It says states can't pass laws prior to viability that impose an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion, that places substantial obstacles in the way of a woman's access to abortion. And that's really been the standard under which we've been living, much longer than Roe. And that standard will allow the court to sustain all kinds of abortion restrictions because they don't need to overrule Casey. They just need to say that's - we've looked at this. That's not an undue burden. It may be a burden, but it's not an undue burden. ### It's just a set of words. They don't really have a lot of meaning, this phrase, undue burden. And if the court does want to get rid of abortion entirely, wants to withdraw the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe in '73 and reaffirmed in Casey in '92, it will have to do it in the context of one of these extreme abortion laws that are being passed by states all around the country, seemingly every week. ### GROSS: Clarence Thomas has said that the Constitution itself is silent on abortion. So what does an originalist, like Clarence Thomas, who's trying to take every word in the Constitution as literally as possible and figure out what the founders meant when they wrote each of those words, what does someone like him to do with an issue like abortion, which, as he said, the Constitution does not directly address? ### LIPTAK: The originalist view - and, you know, it's got a power to it - is that those things that are not spelled out in the Constitution are committed to the political process. And that means people, through their state legislators, can decide whether to allow, how much to allow abortion. And of course, in blue states, abortion, even if Roe is struck down, will remain freely available. In fact, many states are moving to reinforce the right to abortion in their state laws and constitutions. So an originalist would say, Constitution doesn't tell us what to do. The people can decide and states can make what laws they want. ### The other side of it is that the Constitution is written in grand, open-textured phrases that are meant to be filled in by succeeding generations confronting contemporary problems, and that as women's rights came to be acknowledged to be protected by the Constitution, the Constitution, these people would say, should protect women's autonomy, should protect their ability to control their own bodies, should protect their ability to participate fully in the social life of the nation. ### GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Liptak. He's the Supreme Court correspondent for The New York Times. We're going to take a short break, and then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. ### (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ### GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Liptak, the New York Times Supreme Court correspondent. ### I know you think the right to abortion is likely to be chipped away at incrementally, as opposed to Roe v. Wade being overturned, but where is Roe most vulnerable? ### LIPTAK: Listen. It's not hard to write a decision striking down Roe, and we've already sketched out a little bit of how that would work. All you need to do is to say it's built on quicksand. There's nothing in the Constitution. People have struggled to find a provision of the Constitution to root Roe in. The case that all of this was built on, a case about contraception, called Griswold, said you could find a right to privacy that encompasses reproductive rights in the emanations and penumbras of various parts of the Constitution. ### And just saying those words make it easy to see how a decision going the other way could be very workmanlike. And we just say, we express no view on whether abortion is good or bad. All we can tell you is this is not a right protected by the Constitution, and the people can decide how much they want to allow or limit abortion through the political process. ### The day may come when Chief Justice Roberts, writing for five justices of the Supreme Court, writes such a decision. And I may turn out to be wrong, that this is five years from now, not one or two years from now. But it just doesn't seem to me that the court is hellbent to do this right away. ### GROSS: So Roe is grounded in the right to privacy, but the right to privacy isn't stated directly in the Constitution. It's just the penumbra of, (laughter), privacy that's in the Constitution. And then that's where Roe is vulnerable? ### LIPTAK: Right. Yes. Or the phrase of the Constitution that Justice Kennedy and other justices leaned on in Casey was the 14th Amendment's protection of liberty. But that phrase in the Constitution says that states can't deprive people of life, liberty or property without due process of law. ### So the word liberty standing alone sounds pretty good. That sort of, you know, sounds like autonomy. But all it says is, you can't do it without due process of law, which is, like, a procedural right, not a substantive right. So this is getting a little tangled, I know. But there again, it's a legal matter. There are vulnerabilities to the constitutional basis for Roe and Casey. ### GROSS: Since Roberts is considered the swing vote now, and he's more conservative on some issues such as the right to abortion and LGBTQ equality, tell us where you think Roberts stands on abortion. ### LIPTAK: John Roberts is not a fan of abortion. In a case a couple years ago out of Texas, he voted in dissent to sustain some tough restrictions on - in a Texas abortion law that could have driven the number of clinics in the state down to 10 - huge state - from 40. So we don't know a ton about him, jurisprudentially. But on those occasions when he's voted in abortion cases, he's voted to restrict the right to abortion. ### GROSS: Let's talk about President Trump and the Supreme Court. Let's start with this. You know, Merrick Garland, who was President Obama's pick to be the next Supreme Court justice when Obama was president - that nomination was totally blocked by Mitch McConnell. ### Now Merrick Garland's circuit will hear an appeal pertaining to President Trump. Garland is the chief judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. And they're going to hear the Trump administration's appeal of a decision saying that President Trump had to hand over his financial records to a congressional committee. So exactly what will Merrick Garland's role be on this? ### LIPTAK: In the short-term, nothing. He's not on the three-judge panel that will hear the case. Should the losing side of the three-judge panel seek to take the case to the full D.C. Circuit, I imagine Chief Judge Garland would sit. I don't see any reason why he would have to recuse himself. And he would have one vote like anyone else. ### Chief judge is an administrative title. It doesn't give you any particular sway at the court. So I've seen a lot of commentary about, oh, isn't this weird? Isn't this comeuppance of some sort? But I think that's overreading the situation. ### GROSS: Can you tell us about this case and what its importance is? ### LIPTAK: We have a whole set of subpoenas from the Democratically controlled House of Representatives seeking to get information about President Trump, his official actions and his record as a businessman. ### The case that made it to the D.C. Circuit first - although there will be lots of litigation - concerns an attempt to get records from President Trump's accounting firm. A district court judge ordered those records to be disclosed. The D.C. Circuit has put it on a fast track. And one of these cases, or more than one of them, may well reach the Supreme Court. ### GROSS: If it does reach the Supreme Court - if one of these cases does reach the Supreme Court, what do you think the outcome would be? ### LIPTAK: The cases are different, and they present different issues. But broadly speaking, the Supreme Court has enforced congressional subpoenas seeking information. And I would expect the administration to have some challenges at the Supreme Court. Congress has substantial rights to seek information, at least in connection with its legislative function. The court has said - and this makes perfect, common sense - that you can't legislate wisely without having information, and you need to be able to obtain information. ### Now, the Trump people come back and say, yes, but this is for political reasons. It's not authentically in aid of a legislative function. But the Supreme Court and other courts are very reluctant to look behind the motivation of a subpoena, just as they're very unlikely to look behind the motivation of a statute. They look at the words on the page, and if it fits with a very broad conception of the legislative function, most judges are likely to affirm it. ### So while - when President Trump reaches the Supreme Court in other contexts - like, say, the travel ban or the upcoming case on the census - I think the court is likely to be receptive. The court's conservatives, in particular, are likely to be receptive to the Trump administration's arguments. ### The subpoena cases are a little different, and as I say, they all have different factors. Some of them have - the tax case has a statute that requires disclosure of tax returns. That's a particularly strong case. The attempt to subpoena the Mueller report, which has redacted grand jury information in it, might be a weaker case. They're all a little different. ### But I don't think this is, by any means, a lock that we're going to see 5-4 decisions, with the five Republican appointees lining up with the Trump administration. I think there's good reason to think that the House will do well in many courts and even the Supreme Court. ### GROSS: My guest is Adam Liptak, New York Times Supreme Court correspondent. After a break, we'll talk about whether we're in a constitutional crisis, how Robert Mueller's statement yesterday could affect the congressional investigations of the president and how Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are changing the Supreme Court. ### Later, jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will review a new album by drummer and composer Jeff Williams. He's played with Stan Getz, Lee Konitz and Joe Lovano. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. ### (SOUNDBITE OF BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO'S ""DE-DAH"") ### GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Adam Liptak, the Supreme Court correspondent for the New York Times. When we left off, we were talking about the role the Supreme Court might end up playing in the standoff between House congressional committees, which have demanded documents and testimony from the Trump administration, and the president, who has refused to comply. ### Well, you wrote the framers didn't anticipate every problem, including Congress's power to investigate the executive branch or the president's right to keep secrets from Congress. So where does that leave the Supreme Court if there's no constitutional guidance? ### LIPTAK: The court has inferred from the structure of the Constitution both of these things - that you can't legislate without knowing facts; therefore, you have to have the ability to gather facts, including by subpoenas. And that's been made clear in a number of Supreme Court cases. They're not going to walk away from that. ### Similarly, the court has said that there are at least some situations where the president can decline to comply and assert executive privilege and keep secrets. But that's a fairly narrow band, and it's not unyielding. It probably refers to deliberations with close advisers, to national security matters, to the commander in chief power. ### But in the Nixon tapes case, where a criminal inquiry sought access to tapes of Nixon consulting with his advisers in the Oval Office, the Supreme Court unanimously said, yes, there's such a thing as executive privilege. Yes, you can assert it. But it must yield in the face of an important inquiry. So executive privilege is a real thing, too, but it's not a showstopper. ### GROSS: So a case dating back to 1927 is being seen as a precedent for whether the president has to hand over what congressional committees are demanding of him. And so that's a precedent from the Teapot Dome corruption scandal. What was that precedent, and how might it be used in terms of Trump versus congressional investigations? ### LIPTAK: So in that 1927 decision, which involved an investigation of government corruption, the Supreme Court said that congressional inquiries were, quote, ""an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function."" So in English, that means you can't oversee the executive branch without access to information. And that's Congress's job. Congress is in Article I of the Constitution. It makes the laws. The president executes the laws. So in these and other cases, the House starts off in a fairly strong position. ### Now, let me give you a little bit of the arguments going the other way. One of them is, the Trump administration will say, at least as to some of these subpoenas, it's not an authentic legislative task to figure out whether the president committed tax fraud 10 years ago. That has nothing to do with Congress's ability to write tax laws. ### They will also say - and this has some force - that it may be Congress's right, but this is not a matter for the courts. Congress has other tools. The House can deny appropriations. The House can impeach - that this is not something to go to the Supreme Court about, but to use the powers you already have in the Constitution to address a president who's not complying with your demands. ### GROSS: Do you think we're in a constitutional crisis? And I think my larger question is, exactly what is a constitutional crisis? It's an expression I hear all the time. And I've heard at least three or four different definitions about what it is. ### LIPTAK: There's no fixed definition. My editors ask me about once a week, are we in a constitutional crisis? ### GROSS: (Laughter). ### LIPTAK: I mean, one constitutional crisis I can think of is, the Supreme Court says to President Trump - as it said to President Nixon - you must comply with a subpoena. And were President Trump not to comply, that would be a full-blown constitutional crisis. Another kind of... ### GROSS: Because you have two branches of government - Congress versus the executive branch - at odds with each other and no one to decide who wins. ### LIPTAK: Right. If you have a complete breakdown of the complicated, interlocking set of checks and balances that has actually served us very well for more than 200 years - if you just have complete lack of cooperation where, say, the Supreme Court says, Congress wins, and the president says, very interesting you said that; I'm not going to comply - that's a constitutional crisis. We're not particularly close to that. ### Another kind of constitutional crisis I could imagine - let's say a Democrat is elected in 2020, and Republicans continue to control the Senate. And we lose one Supreme Court justice after the other, and nobody is confirmed. You can imagine that kind of constitutional crisis. ### But the term is thrown around a little too loosely. The Constitution is a pretty resilient document. And it may be that we'll be able to muddle our way through even what looks today to be a real crisis not because there haven't been clashes between the branches before - bear in mind that officials of both the George W. Bush and Obama administration were held in contempt by Congress, and those cases went to court and they - over time, they sort of got sorted out. ### But what we have here is, on the one hand, an extremely large number of demands from the House - by the Trump administration's count, more than a hundred - and a complete categorical, totalist (ph), maximalist response by President Trump, who says, we're not complying with any of the subpoenas. Now, if we're to take him at his word - which maybe we shouldn't - that does seem to be the kind of standoff that, if not a constitutional crisis, is a threat to the constitutional order. ### GROSS: So if - somebody would have to bring a case saying that President Trump has to comply with subpoenas or turn over his tax records, and that case would have to make its way to the Supreme Court. ### LIPTAK: Yeah, that's right. But that's underway. I mean, some of those cases are in court. Others will be in court soon enough. One of the cases is already before a federal appeals court, which I think - we'll hear arguments in July, which is fast by legal standards. So this - these cases could reach the court in quite short order. ### GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Liptak, Supreme Court correspondent for the New York Times. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. ### (SOUNDBITE OF JULIAN LAGE GROUP'S ""TELEGRAM"") ### GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Liptak, the Supreme Court correspondent for The New York Times. ### Well, Robert Mueller just broke his silence and made a public statement pertaining to the report and also pertaining to the fact that he's not going to make any more public statements. So what do you feel like you learned from what Mueller said? ### LIPTAK: I think, to a large extent, he set the record straight about the second part of his report, the part involving questions of obstruction of justice by the president. He plainly said that they didn't clear the president. He plainly said that they weren't in a position to indict the president. ### And you put those two things together, and you read between the lines just a little bit. He certainly seems to be suggesting that there is substantial evidence that the House could look at if it were interested in pursuing impeachment charges against the president. And perhaps after the president leaves office, it's possible that a prosecutor might want to consider indicting the president then. ### He's stuck in this weird box where he says, as a matter of Justice Department policy and fundamental fairness, he can't indict the president. But, he says, if I could've cleared him, I would have. And you put those two pieces together, and you go, man, I guess there's some evidence here. ### GROSS: Do you think what Mueller said has any implications for the House committees that are currently investigating the president? ### LIPTAK: I'm not sure it adds anything to a fair reading of the report itself, but some of the commentary around the report and some of the attorney general's summary of the report may have clouded people's understanding of what the report's conclusion, particularly on obstruction, was. And this, you know, crisp, brisk statement from Mueller brings things back into focus. ### GROSS: Do you think Mueller's public comments add anything to the question of, should the president be investigated for obstructing justice, and is that impeachable? ### LIPTAK: No, I think it leaves that conclusion to the House. And the House has complicated calculations to make, some of them legal, some of them political. They are up against the reality that whatever they do, a Republican-controlled Senate is not going to remove the president and the possibility, at least, and maybe even the probability, based on history, based on the Bill Clinton impeachment, that impeaching Trump is actually politically good for Trump. ### So you have conflicting impulses. On the one hand, there's this evidence that looks real of attempts to obstruct an inquiry, and on the other hand, the political reality that the tool the Constitution gives the House - impeachment, an accusation against the president which would be tried in the Senate - is one that is not likely to work and might actually redound to the president's benefit. ### GROSS: If the House decided to impeach President Trump, would that give the House more power to get access to witnesses who Trump has asked not to comply with subpoenas or to information like tax records that the president has decided not to hand over? ### LIPTAK: Very good question, and the answer is an emphatic yes. So congressional subpoenas, when they're merely issued in aid of its legislative responsibilities, can sometimes be overcome. Sometimes courts will allow them, sometimes not. But there's really no question but that the House's power to compel testimony in aid of an impeachment inquiry, as distinguished from legislation, is at its height and that courts are likely to affirm that. And if the president and his associates were to decline to cooperate with subpoenas issued in aid of an impeachment inquiry, they're likely to lose. ### And moreover - and there's historical precedent for this - that would itself be an impeachable offense. So when Nixon declined to comply with congressional subpoenas, the House Judiciary Committee drafted articles of impeachment for that. So it's - there's a chicken and the egg thing here. You get more subpoena power, and a failure to comply with such a subpoena - there's historical precedent for - is itself an impeachable offense when the subpoena comes out of the impeachment inquiry. ### GROSS: So do you think that Robert Mueller just gave the House more reason to - or more evidence for pursuing impeachment? ### LIPTAK: No, I guess I don't go that far. I don't think Mueller said very much beyond what's on the face of the report, although he said it much more crisply. You know, the report is 400 pages long. Almost nobody has read all of it, and the conclusions are a little hard to sort through. ### But in hitting the bullet points, the high points, I don't think he was speaking so much to members of Congress who are - and their staff who are studying this closely. But I think he does put into context for the American public what the basic ground rules here are. ### GROSS: So we have a new court with two Trump appointees - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. You've written about the surprising number of things they have in common. Can you sketch out where their backgrounds intersect? ### LIPTAK: It's sort of extraordinary. They - both of them went to the same Jesuit high school in the suburbs of Washington at the same time. They were two years apart. Kavanaugh was two years ahead of Gorsuch. And then they both went to Ivy League colleges. They both went to Ivy League law schools. They both clerked on the Supreme Court - very prestigious job to be a law clerk to a Supreme Court justice - and a clerk for the same justice - Justice Anthony Kennedy. And they clerked for the same justice in the same term. So their lives have overlapped very closely. ### And then they go on for about a decade each to be appeals court judges, issuing conservative opinions that the conservative legal movement, the Federalist Society loves. They're - make it onto the lists that candidate and then President Trump circulates. They're confirmed by close votes in the Senate. And you would think, you know, we have twins. You know, we have two people who were put in a test tube to be exactly the same person. And they get on the court. And it turns out they're human beings, and they have some significant differences. ### GROSS: What are some of their differences? ### LIPTAK: What - some of it is stylistic. Neil Gorsuch is a big personality - folksy, a showy writer, a kind of - how to say this nicely - on the bench, he sometimes have - has a certain self-satisfied air. He arrived on the job and felt very comfortable on the job almost immediately. So that's one set of stylistic approaches to the job. ### Brett Kavanaugh, so far, has been much more modest, workmanlike. A good, crisp writer, but not one with a lot of flair. And a sort of straight-ahead questioner on the bench. So there are stylistic differences. ### But more importantly, there are interpretive differences. They approach the Constitution and statutes a little differently. Gorsuch, who seems to be the more conservative of the two, is very much an originalist, meaning he wants to figure out what the Constitution meant when it was adopted, and a textualist, meaning he only cares about the words of the statute Congress passed and not about what the purpose of the statute was, not about what the consequences of a given ruling might be. ### Kavanaugh - and the evidence is thin. He's only been on the court for a little bit - seems much more pragmatic, seems much more open to saying, well, what makes sense here? What's the workable, sensible answer to this question. Sure, you can interpret it this way. You can interpret it that way. But which way is America better off? ### And that has caused them, on not a few occasions, to be on the other side of some cases. Not the biggest cases, but still enough to illuminate the differences. ### GROSS: Are you sensing a growing amount of tension between the justices? You used the word rancorous in (laughter) a recent article. ### LIPTAK: Very much so, and especially in the area of the death penalty. The liberal justices and the conservative justices are deeply divided on issues that arise in last-minute stays, requests, in death penalty cases. Justice Breyer, who is not easily angered, wrote a bitter dissent at 3 o'clock in the morning, saying his colleagues wouldn't even wait till the morning to discuss a case with him. And over and over again, the right side of the court has said that there are abuses in death penalty litigations and people are bringing groundless claims at the last minute in a kind of cynical gamesmanship. ### And the left side of the court is saying, wait a second, these are serious issues. They involve life or death. Why don't we consider them in a deliberate way? And where, when Justice Kennedy was on the court, he seemed to be a moderating force - he would sometimes go one way, sometimes go the other. Always keep it civil - now there's a level of rancor and anger on the court, which is quite new. ### GROSS: How is that being expressed? In writing, or in discussions? What access do you have to that? ### LIPTAK: Well, it's certainly been discussed in a whole series of opinions, including - and this is so weird - opinions issued weeks after the fact. They keep relitigating these issues. And in a different case, they'll drop a footnote about the old case. And so they can't let it go. ### And they have even on occasion, again, in writing, sort of opened the curtain on behind-the-scenes deliberations on how they can't even get along well enough to sit down together to discuss something. So you're seeing a new era at the court. This is a court in transition, and it's a little rocky. ### GROSS: So Justice Kennedy had been considered the swing vote in the Supreme Court, and he's retired. So Justice Roberts, the chief justice, is now seen as the swing vote. How swingy has he been? Like, what can you learn from his recent decisions? ### LIPTAK: Justice Kennedy, although basically conservative, leaned left in important areas like abortion and affirmative action and, most importantly, gay rights. Those are not areas in which the chief justice is likely to go in a liberal direction. ### But there have been a couple of instances where the chief justice has joined the four liberals to make up a 5-4 majority. One of them involved a case about an abortion restriction out of Louisiana which the chief justice, agreeing with the liberals, provisionally blocked. ### A second one involved a Trump administration asylum policy where, again, the chief justice with the four liberals, in a 5-4 decision, blocked. Chief Justice Roberts is a very smart and savvy man, and I'm sure he's thinking very carefully about how to thread the needle between what, on the one hand, is an impulse to move the court to the right and is, on the other hand, an impulse to be cautious and to guard the institutional reputation of his court. ### GROSS: Adam Liptak, thank you so much for coming back to FRESH AIR.

6678,nbcnews.com,2019-05-31T18:20:21-04:00,"May 31, 2019, 9:52 PM UTC ### By Jessica Levinson, professor at Loyola Law School ### The Supreme Court is about to start looking a lot more like a political branch. Indeed, in a decade or less, we may look back at this time as the era in which the court lost any imprimatur of judicial independence. ### The court’s upcoming decision as to whether the Department of Commerce can add a question about citizenship to our national census will provide us with some important tea leaves for determining whether the current court is becoming the handmaiden of conservative politicians. The court is expected to rule by the end of June. ### New evidence suggests that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross’ decision to add a citizenship question to the census had everything to do with helping Republicans and harming Democrats. These revelations mostly confirm what many observers had long suspected about the true motivations of the Commerce Department. What is more surprising — and revealing — is the fact that none of this is likely to matter to the Supreme Court. ### These revelations mostly confirm what many observers had long suspected. What is more shocking is the fact that none of this is likely to matter to the Supreme Court. ### The legal issues of the case may sound mundane, but the political stakes are huge. The U.S. Constitution says that Congress must count how many people live in our country. The census, conducted by the Department of Commerce, determines the number of representatives in the House, the distribution of electors in the Electoral College, and the amount of federal funding each state gets. While the commerce secretary is in charge of the census, he or she cannot engage in activities that are arbitrary and capricious. And yet, that is just what Secretary Wilbur Ross has done. ### In 2017, Ross disingenuously claimed that the Department of Justice had suggested that the Department of Commerce add a citizenship question to the census to help in enforcing the federal Voting Rights Act. But the idea to add the citizenship question appears not to have originated with the Department of Justice and has nothing to do with enforcing voters' rights. Meanwhile, many experts believe that adding a citizenship question to the census will lead people in immigrant-heavy areas, including legal and illegal immigrants, to not respond. This inaccuracy is why career experts in the Department of Commerce unanimously recommended that the citizenship question not be included. ### Smoking gun evidence of Trump's push to rig the census ### May 31, 201906:37 ### This is not a minor issue. The Census Department itself estimates that as many as 6.5 million people could not be counted as a result of adding the citizenship question. And it is not a coincidence that the majority of these 6.5 million people live in areas dominated by Democrats. In fact, we now know, that is in fact the whole point. ### Recently discovered documents on the computer of now-deceased Republican operative and redistricting expert Thomas Hofeller indicate that the idea to add the citizenship question actually originated with him, not the Department of Justice. His goal was not to help the Department of Justice enforce the Voting Rights Act, but rather to use this information to allow states to draw legislative district lines based not on the total population, but instead on the number of eligible voters. This would, he wrote, help “Republicans and non-Hispanic whites,” and would clearly hurt Democrats. ### The newly unearthed documents do not tell us more than what many already strongly suspected, but they do bring into stark relief why the Trump administration is so determined to add the citizenship question, and how they have lied about it. ### During oral arguments in April , the conservative members of the court appeared ready to accept at face value the Department of Commerce’s assertion that the citizenship question will be added to help enforce the Voting Rights Act. It is worth remembering that the conservative wing of the court has not been particularly concerned about the Voting Rights Act in the past. In fact, just six years ago it struck down a key portion of the act designed to protect voters from discriminatory voting laws. ### Since that 2013 decision, states and localities throughout the nation have enacted laws burdening the right to vote . States have, for instance, reduced or eliminated early voting, reduced the number of voting centers, purged voter rolls, and implemented stringent voter identification requirements. This was an entirely predictable consequence of the court’s decision. ### More recently, a slim conservative majority of the court voted to uphold an Ohio law that took voters off the voter rolls if they failed to both vote in one election and respond to a postcard asking them to confirm their address. The court couched its language in the need to protect the integrity of the electoral process, but the truth is that Ohio’s law disproportionately affects the ability of poor and minority voters to vote. And again, not coincidentally, those people are disproportionately Democrats. ### The idea that Ross wants to add the citizenship question to the census to help enforce the Voting Rights Act is a farce, which every court to rule on this issue has recognized. ### In other words, the conservative wing of the court has shown no concern about the Voting Rights Act. And the idea that Ross wants to add the citizenship question to the census to help enforce the Voting Rights Act is a farce, which every court to rule on this issue has recognized. ### Three lower federal courts have ruled that the Department of Commerce can not add a citizenship question to the census, at least under these circumstances. They all agreed that Ross failed to put forward valid reasons for the addition of the question. ### The three lower courts were right. The Supreme Court appears ready to undermine its legitimacy by ignoring reality and context and overturning those decisions. ### If this sounds familiar, it is because the court did the same thing last year when it ruled to uphold President Donald Trump’s travel ban . Despite numerous statements by both candidate Trump and President Trump that the purpose of the ban was to bar Muslims from entering the country, the court ignored reality, ignored context, and just looked at the words on the page of Trump’s third try at implementing a travel ban. ### This is looking less and less like an ideological battle between conservative and liberal judges and more like a Supreme Court controlled by partisan politicians in robes. And the census ruling could prove it. ### Jessica Levinson ### Jessica Levinson is a professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles.

Add your two cents. ### What follows is a conversation between Executive Director of Common Cause North Carolina Bob Phillips and Marc Steiner Peries of The Real News Network. Read a transcript of their conversation below or watch the video at the bottom of the post. ### MARC STEINER Welcome to The Real News Network. I’m Marc Steiner. It’s great to have you all with us. ### Voting rights goes to the heart of our very democracy. Using race to abridge those rights was commonplace in our country and gerrymandering districts to disenfranchise another political party is as old as the republic itself. Now, North Carolina Republicans have gerrymandered their legislative and congressional districts to ensure that Democrats cannot control the state’s political future, despite the fact that Democrats are in the majority. Common Cause took them to court in Common Cause v. Lewis to challenge the gerrymandering of those districts. In the course of their case, they’ve discovered documents that clearly show that Trump’s administration lied when pushing for a citizenship question on the 2020 census. It may seem disconnected; they’re not. What seems separate, is really connected, and the future of our voting rights are on the line. ### We are joined by Bob Phillips, Executive Director of Common Cause North Carolina. And Bob, welcome. Good to have you with us. ### BOB PHILLIPS Thank you, Marc. A pleasure to be with you too. ### MARC STEINER So let’s talk about this. For just for our viewers, very quickly describe your original court case and this discovery that was made in the course of your fighting for a totally different, not disconnected issue of gerrymandering in North Carolina. ### BOB PHILLIPS North Carolina has been number one. We like to think of ourselves as number one in basketball, but in this case too we’re number one in gerrymandering, and we’ve actually got two cases— Common Cause v. Rucho, which was argued before the US Supreme Court will get a decision later this month, connected to a similar gerrymandering case out of Maryland. Where, as we were saying, one is in our case, Republicans gerrymandering Democrats; the Maryland case, Democrats gerrymandering Republicans, but Common Cause v. Lewis is very similar. It is a challenge of our state constitution, saying that lawmakers engaged in extreme partisan gerrymandering on the legislative maps. ### We are in discovery. We don’t go to trial until mid-July and in the course of discovery, we were fortunate enough to get the 75,000 files from the mastermind, a guy named Thomas Hofeller, who had really gerrymandered maps all around the country, but also in North Carolina. And recently, we, our attorneys discovered this memo that, sort of, linked Hofeller to the census and the citizenship question, and so that’s kind of how this thing has today hit the news in a big way. We are seeing that the man who was rigging maps for partisan advantage was behind the same, I guess, kind of, effort to rig the census for a partisan advantage. ### MARC STEINER Well, let’s cover this for a bit here because there’s a number of interesting aspects to this. First of all, his daughter, Stephanie Hofeller Lizon, really was estranged from her father. So, she inherited all of his files, went through his files, found this information, and brought it to you. I guess, A—it shows you better stay close to your children, [laughs] wonder what they might discover about you and tell the world. But so, that’s literally what happened, right? She found these files and gave it to you all in the course of your work working around the gerrymandering issue. Is that right? ### BOB PHILLIPS Marc, it was really the day after the holiday break in early January, the phone rings in my office, and on the other end of the line is Stephanie Hofeller. I didn’t know who she was, and even when she made the connection, I wasn’t sure why she was calling. And honestly, she was calling really about another legal matter. She lives outside of North Carolina, her mother still living here, and she was in need of some legal help and felt like there was no one in this town whom she could trust because, as you’ve mentioned, she was estranged from her father. It led to multiple conversations. We were actually trying to assist her just, as you know, being nice people, if you will. Over the course of several conversations, we learned she had these files and then was willing to share with us. The lesson I, kind of, took out of this was, always pick up the phone even if you don’t know who’s on the other end of the line. [MARC laughs] It’s worth picking it up and answering the call. And so, that’s what we did. ### MARC STEINER So let’s go through some, just a little bit of what her files, the files she gave you that her father had. They really, I mean, and we showed a bit of this, but let me read some of this that we just showed. We can put that back up and let people see it. What they showed was that when they testified in court, that they lied, that the Trump administration people, Attorney General Gore and others, lied on the stand. They testified that they drafted this initial letter to request citizenship in October, early November in 2017. It was actually done before that. He testified that Dr. Hofeller said, when they asked him a question about the citizenship question in January 2017, he said Mark, you need to make sure that we take a good census, that the administration doesn’t skimp on the budget, is all he said Hofeller had done when, in fact, Hofeller ghostwrote the Neuman Department of Justice letter that outlined it all. ### And, there’s so many other things here— that he was one of the people, that they relied on Hofeller for expertise on voting rights when that was not, and they denied doing that; that Hofeller told him that citizenship question would maximize representation for the Latino community when in reality what Hofeller wrote was the opposite, that we can dampen down and make sure that white people have the vote and Latinos and blacks don’t. So, I mean, these were out-and-out lies that were told. I mean, it’s just mind-blowing that this stuff was revealed, so what does that mean? Where will this take you? ### BOB PHILLIPS Well, you know, it’s pretty serious when you’re committing perjury before Congress, which indeed it looks like this could be very well the case, and this was what was filed in a brief today at the New York District Court where this citizenship case originated. You know, you want to say it’s shocking and in today’s world, who knows really how people are reacting, but it’s outrageous. I’m angered by it, as every American really should be, that this was not about what the officials in the Justice Department and Commerce Department had been saying, that it was about a better enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. It was all a sham, a plan to try to reduce, dilute the voting strength of in this case Latinos and other minorities who, you know, granted, might be intimidated by this question of “are you a citizen?” on the census— something we’ve never done. ### We’ve never asked every person living in this country that question. It’s been done in small samples, but never done to the entire universe of people, so it’s terrible. Certainly, our hope is that the United States Supreme Court—And my understanding is that a filing was going to be made earlier today to provide them this evidence, and even though that case has been heard— the oral arguments were made April 23rd— still, this is very relevant information. My understanding is that the US Supreme Court can certainly take this in, and maybe it alters the opinion they come out with, or maybe one of the Justices decides to peel away from where they are now. I mean, all that’s speculative but, again, for those of us who were deeply concerned about this, you know, our hope is that maybe this might change what a lot of people have been anticipating as a 5-4 decision that would come in favor of the Trump administration, so we just have to wait and see. ### MARC STEINER So, I mean, that was one of the questions I was going to ask is, we just don’t know how this will play out. I mean, they could very well say that the arguments have closed and we can’t take this new evidence in, but this new evidence, it would seem to me if the Supreme Court had to hear it, could affect a ruling in favor of the citizenship question on the 2020 census. I mean, this is one of the most critical findings I’ve heard about in a long time, and you literally stumbled across it. ### BOB PHILLIPS We literally did. I mean, my understanding is this information, you know, kind of, came to light within the last week. So timing-wise, you know, we were not able to provide it in a timely fashion because we didn’t know about it. We didn’t realize it was there but still, you know, this case has not been rendered by the high court and they have certainly time. Again, I’m just saying this as a citizen. I don’t know any inside information and I’m not an attorney, but to take this evidence, thoughtfully take it in, as they ultimately make that decision. ### MARC STEINER So, one last question because I’m really curious about how you all think about this, what your internal conversations were about. I mean, if you take this case, the one that you have pushed in North Carolina around gerrymandering that pushes black folks and minorities and Democrats into districts where they cannot gain representation because of how they redistricted the state itself; and then you take this case about the citizenship question on the US Census, which could in fact mean, as Hofeller himself has said, which is why he did it, to ensure that Latinos don’t vote and they’re not counted, which can change the nature of districts so that the Democrats and others will not have their do in Congress and other places, as Republicans would— I mean, this to me, if you combine these things, can go to the very heart of our democracy, the heart of what voting means. It’s like turning all the struggles around voting rights on its head, as they attempted to do when they used the Voting Rights Act to justify using the citizenship question. So, I think what’s happening here is monumental in terms of what the future could hold. ### BOB PHILLIPS They are linked. I mean, the census is all about an accurate count for apportionment as well as the distribution of federal dollars. And to think that this was some plan crafted perhaps right here in Raleigh. I mean, this is where Thomas, Dr. Hofeller, lived. And again, that he was responsible for the manipulation and the rigging of district maps across the country, and then had a hand in this kind of a plan to rig again the census for the purposes of an advantage with redistricting to a particular party, is again very disturbing, very frightening, and again we hope it harnesses some outrage across the country. ### MARC STEINER Well, this is certainly eye-opening, and we look forward to following this and talking to you all more down line as this unfolds, especially as we see the Supreme Court takes up the evidence you all have discovered. Bob Phillips, Executive Director of Common Cause North Carolina, thank you so much for joining us here on The Real News. It’s been a pleasure to talk with you. ### BOB PHILLIPS Thank you, Marc. Great talking to you, as well. ### MARC STEINER And I’m Marc Steiner here for The Real News Network. Thanks for joining us. Take care."

Scott Applewhite/Associated Press/File 2019) ### WASHINGTON — Just weeks before the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the Trump administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, new evidence emerged Thursday suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to white Republicans. ### The evidence was found in the files of a prominent Republican redistricting strategist, Thomas Hofeller, who died in August. It reveals that Hofeller ‘‘played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census in order to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, ‘Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,’ ‘‘ and that Trump administration officials purposely obscured Hofeller’s role in court proceedings, lawyers for plaintiffs challenging the question wrote in a letter to US District Judge Jesse Furman. Furman was one of three federal judges who ruled against the question this year. ### Advertisement ### The letter drew on new information discovered on Hofeller’s hard drives, which were found accidentally by Hofeller’s estranged daughter. Stephanie Hofeller Lizon then shared them with the organization Common Cause for a gerrymandering lawsuit it is pursuing in North Carolina. ### The files show that Hofeller concluded in a 2015 study that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census ‘‘would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats’’ and benefit white Republicans in redistricting. Hofeller then pushed the idea with the Trump administration in 2017, according to the lawyers’ letter to Furman. ### The evidence, which was first reported by The New York Times, contradicts sworn testimony by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s expert adviser Mark Neuman and senior Justice Department official John Gore, as well as other testimony by defendants, the letter said. ### The Commerce and Justice departments did not respond to questions about the new information. ### The American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion in district court Thursday morning for ‘‘sanctions and any other relief the court deems appropriate, because of apparently untruthful testimony’’ by Trump administration officials in the earlier trials, said Dale Ho, who argued the case at the Supreme Court on behalf of the ACLU. ### Advertisement ### It is unclear how the information might affect deliberations at the Supreme Court. The ACLU Thursday afternoon filed a letter with the court to ‘‘respectfully inform’’ it of the motion filed in New York District Court and that a hearing was scheduled for next week. ### The letter repeated the charge contained in the earlier letter to Furman that Hofeller played a significant role in adding the citizenship question to give white Republicans an advantage in redistricting ‘‘and that Petitioners [the government] obscured his role through affirmative misrepresentations.’’ ### The letter from Ho did not ask the court to take action, but it drew its attention to the new motion; the hearing would be Wednesday. ### ‘‘Witnesses misrepresented the origin and purpose of their effort to add a citizenship question to the census,’’ Ho said in a statement accompanying release of the letter. ‘‘Their goal was not to protect voting rights, but to dilute the voting power of minority communities. We look forward to Wednesday’s hearing and will keep the Supreme Court aware of any further developments.’’ ### The Supreme Court heard the case on April 23. The case concluded with oral arguments that day, and it appeared the conservative majority seemed inclined to agree with the government that the decision to add the question was within the commerce secretary’s authority. ### Advertisement ### The court, if it followed normal procedure, voted that week, and the justices are now writing the opinion. ### The ACLU also asked the district court to allow previously redacted testimony from Neuman to be made public. On Thursday, Furman ordered the government to provide a response by 10 a.m. Friday; he called a hearing on the matter for Wednesday. ### The new information indicates that blueprints for adding a citizenship question predated the Trump administration, but Donald Trump’s election allowed them to become a reality, Ho said. ### ‘‘It just shows that there was a long-standing plan to weaponize the census to dilute minority voting power to try to forestall the electoral effects of the demographic changes that this country is undergoing,’’ he said. ### Ho said sanctions could include fines imposed on witnesses or the government, a reopening of the case, or an amendment of the final judgment to account for new evidence. ### The population count from the decennial census is used to allocate $800 billion a year in federal funding and to determine congressional representation and redistricting. Opponents of the citizenship question have argued that it will discourage immigrants from taking part in the census, resulting in an undercount in the areas where they live. ### Hofeller’s files also reveal that in August 2017 he helped ghostwrite a draft Department of Justice letter to the Commerce Department requesting a citizenship question and coming up with a rationale: to help enforce the Voting Rights Act, the plaintiffs’ lawyers said. He then gave this letter to Gore, the principal deputy assistant attorney general, in October 2017, they said. ### Advertisement ### The genesis of that request and the rationale behind it were key questions in trials challenging the question. Ross initially told Congress the request was initiated by the Justice Department in a December 2017 letter, but administration documents released in the case later indicated it came at Ross’s urging, starting months earlier. Census and voting rights experts have said the question is not needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act. ### Follow Us"
7042,npr.org,2019-05-31T06:50:39-04:00,"Email ### TERRY GROSS, HOST: ### This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The Supreme Court will soon wrap up its first term with two sitting justices appointed by President Trump - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. One of the big questions about this new court is, will it strike down Roe v. Wade or continue to allow states to chip away at women's access to abortion? ### My guest Adam Liptak is the Supreme Court correspondent for The New York Times. We're going to talk about the direction of the court on issues pertaining to abortion and the Trump administration, and we'll examine how Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are changing the court. ### Adam Liptak, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Let's talk about how the right to have an abortion is being challenged in the Supreme Court. And let's start with a case that was decided this week. Describe the law that had been struck down and was appealed to the Supreme Court. ### ADAM LIPTAK: The law had two pieces. One piece said you can't have an abortion if you're doing it for a bad reason. And among those reasons were that the fetus has a disability or you wanted to choose the sex of a child. So that's part one of the law. Part two of the law tells abortion providers that they have to dispose of fetal remains by burying or cremating them. ### GROSS: So how did the court decide? ### LIPTAK: The court decided not to review the ruling on the forbidden grounds part of the law. It let stand a lower court ruling that struck down that law as contrary to Roe v. Wade, which, in essence, says the states can't ban abortions until viability - until the fetus is viable outside the womb. So it declines review in the forbidden grounds part of the law. ### On the other hand, on the more modest part of the law on disposal of fetal remains, the court reverses the lower court and says that law is acceptable. But it says, at the same time, it's not really an abortion law. We're not analyzing it under abortion precedents. We're just saying a state is entitled to have such a law. Just as it could tell, say, a veterinarian how to dispose of the bodies of animals that died, it can tell abortion providers how to dispose of fetal remains. ### GROSS: One of the things that really confuses me about the law that was overturned, the law that said that a woman can't decide to have an abortion based on choosing what gender she wanted to have or deciding to have an abortion because the fetus was diagnosed as having Down syndrome or another, you know, serious illness or abnormality - if a woman says, I'm having an abortion just 'cause I want to, who's to say that she's having it because she's choosing the gender? Who's to say she's having it because the fetus was diagnosed with Down syndrome? I mean, how can you know what's in a woman's heart when she decides to have an abortion? ### LIPTAK: Right. And that goes to a point about many of these laws. They're symbolic, in a way. They'd be very, very hard to police. What woman is going to announce that - in the face of such a law, that she's aborting a fetus because of Down syndrome? It's also a curious law that says, sure, you can have an abortion on a whim. You just can't have it for an expressed reason that a lot of people might think was a sound reason. ### GROSS: If the Supreme Court had heard the case, the part of the case pertaining to selectively having an abortion based on gender - the gender or the health of the fetus - would've given the court the first chance to consider the constitutionality of a state law restricting abortion since Kavanaugh replaced Kennedy last year. Do you think that the conservative members of the Supreme Court are just waiting for a better case to challenge Roe? ### LIPTAK: No. My sense is that the court would rather move more cautiously and uphold more modest restrictions on abortion, rather than go headlong into the question of overruling Roe v. Wade. And there are a lot - so there are two kinds of abortion laws in the land. Some of them make it hard for women to get an abortion - laws about admitting privileges and waiting periods. ### And I think the court is likely to take those kinds of cases, uphold the restrictions and make it harder for women - particularly women in red states, particularly poor women in red states - to get abortions, but is not particularly eager, in the next year, two, five, to headlong go into, is Roe v. Wade ready to be overturned? I - the court will get there, quite likely, but I don't think it's in a rush. ### I think Chief Justice Roberts is not a friend of Roe, but is also an incrementalist, an institutionalist - wants to protect the legitimacy and prestige of his court and wants to move slowly. He's only 64 years old. He's got plenty of time. ### Now, that does mean he needs to reign in the justices to his right. Three of them seem ready to move. And that places the newest justice, Justice Kavanaugh, in an important position because although it takes five votes to decide a case at the Supreme Court, it only takes four votes to put the case on the docket. And if four justices do put a big abortion case on the docket, there's - it's not at all clear that at that point, forced to decide, Chief Justice Roberts will vote to sustain Roe. I think, more likely, he'd vote to strike it down. ### GROSS: So voting it onto the docket is a really big issue right now. And you say it's really Kavanaugh who's going to be deciding that. What do we know about Kavanaugh's record on the right to abortion? ### LIPTAK: On the appeals court, he participated in a decision in which it looked like he doesn't have a lot of use for Roe v. Wade. But he, too, at least in his early time on the court - and he's only been there for, you know, several months - has exhibited a kind of caution and there - and has voted closely with the chief justice, has been in the majority more than any other justice, doesn't seem to want to get out of the gate, particularly following his stormy confirmation hearings, doing something truly radical. So I think he, too, will be inclined to move slowly. ### But, you know, as you say, Terry, it only takes the four votes. And if Kavanaugh were to join the three more conservative justices - Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch - to put the case on the docket, the court could well overturn Roe v. Wade. ### GROSS: So what are the cases most likely to come to the Supreme Court because they were designed to be test cases? ### LIPTAK: My sense is - so we're seeing these abortion laws all over the country. Seemingly every week, there's a new one. And they - and you know, Alabama says, you can't have an abortion at all, including if you were raped or the victim of incest, and wants to impose very harsh prison terms on doctors who perform abortions. Other states have these so-called fetal heartbeat laws, which effectively ban abortion at six weeks, a point in time when many women don't even know that they're pregnant. ### Those cases, those outright bans on abortion that flatly conflict with Roe, are very likely to be struck down by lower courts. They really ought to be struck down by lower courts because lower courts are supposed to apply Supreme Court precedent, and Supreme Court precedent requires them to be struck down. Then the question is, does the Supreme Court simply deny review? - which is what it does routinely in the vast majority of cases. Ninety-nine percent of cases, the court simply denies review - or do we reach a point at which there are four votes to put such a case on the docket? ### Again, I don't think that's going to happen particularly soon. I think the court will instead engage in a project of hollowing out the right to abortion by sustaining all kinds of restrictions on abortion, but is not really looking for a headline - a banner headline in the New York Times that says Supreme Court 5-4 overrules Roe v. Wade. It would rather do it a little more cautiously and incrementally. ### GROSS: So if the Supreme Court is unlikely to overturn Roe v. Wade, it sounds like it might be more likely to overturn Casey, the 1992 decision? Do you want to explain that decision and where that figures in to where we're headed on abortion rights? ### LIPTAK: In a sense, Roe and Casey do the same thing, but Casey introduces a new test on abortion laws, and it's a very squishy test. It says states can't pass laws prior to viability that impose an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion, that places substantial obstacles in the way of a woman's access to abortion. And that's really been the standard under which we've been living, much longer than Roe. And that standard will allow the court to sustain all kinds of abortion restrictions because they don't need to overrule Casey. They just need to say that's - we've looked at this. That's not an undue burden. It may be a burden, but it's not an undue burden. ### It's just a set of words. They don't really have a lot of meaning, this phrase, undue burden. And if the court does want to get rid of abortion entirely, wants to withdraw the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe in '73 and reaffirmed in Casey in '92, it will have to do it in the context of one of these extreme abortion laws that are being passed by states all around the country, seemingly every week. ### GROSS: Clarence Thomas has said that the Constitution itself is silent on abortion. So what does an originalist, like Clarence Thomas, who's trying to take every word in the Constitution as literally as possible and figure out what the founders meant when they wrote each of those words, what does someone like him to do with an issue like abortion, which, as he said, the Constitution does not directly address? ### LIPTAK: The originalist view - and, you know, it's got a power to it - is that those things that are not spelled out in the Constitution are committed to the political process. And that means people, through their state legislators, can decide whether to allow, how much to allow abortion. And of course, in blue states, abortion, even if Roe is struck down, will remain freely available. In fact, many states are moving to reinforce the right to abortion in their state laws and constitutions. So an originalist would say, Constitution doesn't tell us what to do. The people can decide and states can make what laws they want. ### The other side of it is that the Constitution is written in grand, open-textured phrases that are meant to be filled in by succeeding generations confronting contemporary problems, and that as women's rights came to be acknowledged to be protected by the Constitution, the Constitution, these people would say, should protect women's autonomy, should protect their ability to control their own bodies, should protect their ability to participate fully in the social life of the nation. ### GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Liptak. He's the Supreme Court correspondent for The New York Times. We're going to take a short break, and then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. ### (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ### GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Liptak, the New York Times Supreme Court correspondent. ### I know you think the right to abortion is likely to be chipped away at incrementally, as opposed to Roe v. Wade being overturned, but where is Roe most vulnerable? ### LIPTAK: Listen. It's not hard to write a decision striking down Roe, and we've already sketched out a little bit of how that would work. All you need to do is to say it's built on quicksand. There's nothing in the Constitution. People have struggled to find a provision of the Constitution to root Roe in. The case that all of this was built on, a case about contraception, called Griswold, said you could find a right to privacy that encompasses reproductive rights in the emanations and penumbras of various parts of the Constitution. ### And just saying those words make it easy to see how a decision going the other way could be very workmanlike. And we just say, we express no view on whether abortion is good or bad. All we can tell you is this is not a right protected by the Constitution, and the people can decide how much they want to allow or limit abortion through the political process. ### The day may come when Chief Justice Roberts, writing for five justices of the Supreme Court, writes such a decision. And I may turn out to be wrong, that this is five years from now, not one or two years from now. But it just doesn't seem to me that the court is hellbent to do this right away. ### GROSS: So Roe is grounded in the right to privacy, but the right to privacy isn't stated directly in the Constitution. It's just the penumbra of, (laughter), privacy that's in the Constitution. And then that's where Roe is vulnerable? ### LIPTAK: Right. Yes. Or the phrase of the Constitution that Justice Kennedy and other justices leaned on in Casey was the 14th Amendment's protection of liberty. But that phrase in the Constitution says that states can't deprive people of life, liberty or property without due process of law. ### So the word liberty standing alone sounds pretty good. That sort of, you know, sounds like autonomy. But all it says is, you can't do it without due process of law, which is, like, a procedural right, not a substantive right. So this is getting a little tangled, I know. But there again, it's a legal matter. There are vulnerabilities to the constitutional basis for Roe and Casey. ### GROSS: Since Roberts is considered the swing vote now, and he's more conservative on some issues such as the right to abortion and LGBTQ equality, tell us where you think Roberts stands on abortion. ### LIPTAK: John Roberts is not a fan of abortion. In a case a couple years ago out of Texas, he voted in dissent to sustain some tough restrictions on - in a Texas abortion law that could have driven the number of clinics in the state down to 10 - huge state - from 40. So we don't know a ton about him, jurisprudentially. But on those occasions when he's voted in abortion cases, he's voted to restrict the right to abortion. ### GROSS: Let's talk about President Trump and the Supreme Court. Let's start with this. You know, Merrick Garland, who was President Obama's pick to be the next Supreme Court justice when Obama was president - that nomination was totally blocked by Mitch McConnell. ### Now Merrick Garland's circuit will hear an appeal pertaining to President Trump. Garland is the chief judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. And they're going to hear the Trump administration's appeal of a decision saying that President Trump had to hand over his financial records to a congressional committee. So exactly what will Merrick Garland's role be on this? ### LIPTAK: In the short-term, nothing. He's not on the three-judge panel that will hear the case. Should the losing side of the three-judge panel seek to take the case to the full D.C. Circuit, I imagine Chief Judge Garland would sit. I don't see any reason why he would have to recuse himself. And he would have one vote like anyone else. ### Chief judge is an administrative title. It doesn't give you any particular sway at the court. So I've seen a lot of commentary about, oh, isn't this weird? Isn't this comeuppance of some sort? But I think that's overreading the situation. ### GROSS: Can you tell us about this case and what its importance is? ### LIPTAK: We have a whole set of subpoenas from the Democratically controlled House of Representatives seeking to get information about President Trump, his official actions and his record as a businessman. ### The case that made it to the D.C. Circuit first - although there will be lots of litigation - concerns an attempt to get records from President Trump's accounting firm. A district court judge ordered those records to be disclosed. The D.C. Circuit has put it on a fast track. And one of these cases, or more than one of them, may well reach the Supreme Court. ### GROSS: If it does reach the Supreme Court - if one of these cases does reach the Supreme Court, what do you think the outcome would be? ### LIPTAK: The cases are different, and they present different issues. But broadly speaking, the Supreme Court has enforced congressional subpoenas seeking information. And I would expect the administration to have some challenges at the Supreme Court. Congress has substantial rights to seek information, at least in connection with its legislative function. The court has said - and this makes perfect, common sense - that you can't legislate wisely without having information, and you need to be able to obtain information. ### Now, the Trump people come back and say, yes, but this is for political reasons. It's not authentically in aid of a legislative function. But the Supreme Court and other courts are very reluctant to look behind the motivation of a subpoena, just as they're very unlikely to look behind the motivation of a statute. They look at the words on the page, and if it fits with a very broad conception of the legislative function, most judges are likely to affirm it. ### So while - when President Trump reaches the Supreme Court in other contexts - like, say, the travel ban or the upcoming case on the census - I think the court is likely to be receptive. The court's conservatives, in particular, are likely to be receptive to the Trump administration's arguments. ### The subpoena cases are a little different, and as I say, they all have different factors. Some of them have - the tax case has a statute that requires disclosure of tax returns. That's a particularly strong case. The attempt to subpoena the Mueller report, which has redacted grand jury information in it, might be a weaker case. They're all a little different. ### But I don't think this is, by any means, a lock that we're going to see 5-4 decisions, with the five Republican appointees lining up with the Trump administration. I think there's good reason to think that the House will do well in many courts and even the Supreme Court. ### GROSS: My guest is Adam Liptak, New York Times Supreme Court correspondent. After a break, we'll talk about whether we're in a constitutional crisis, how Robert Mueller's statement yesterday could affect the congressional investigations of the president and how Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are changing the Supreme Court. ### Later, jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will review a new album by drummer and composer Jeff Williams. He's played with Stan Getz, Lee Konitz and Joe Lovano. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. ### (SOUNDBITE OF BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO'S ""DE-DAH"") ### GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Adam Liptak, the Supreme Court correspondent for the New York Times. When we left off, we were talking about the role the Supreme Court might end up playing in the standoff between House congressional committees, which have demanded documents and testimony from the Trump administration, and the president, who has refused to comply. ### Well, you wrote the framers didn't anticipate every problem, including Congress's power to investigate the executive branch or the president's right to keep secrets from Congress. So where does that leave the Supreme Court if there's no constitutional guidance? ### LIPTAK: The court has inferred from the structure of the Constitution both of these things - that you can't legislate without knowing facts; therefore, you have to have the ability to gather facts, including by subpoenas. And that's been made clear in a number of Supreme Court cases. They're not going to walk away from that. ### Similarly, the court has said that there are at least some situations where the president can decline to comply and assert executive privilege and keep secrets. But that's a fairly narrow band, and it's not unyielding. It probably refers to deliberations with close advisers, to national security matters, to the commander in chief power. ### But in the Nixon tapes case, where a criminal inquiry sought access to tapes of Nixon consulting with his advisers in the Oval Office, the Supreme Court unanimously said, yes, there's such a thing as executive privilege. Yes, you can assert it. But it must yield in the face of an important inquiry. So executive privilege is a real thing, too, but it's not a showstopper. ### GROSS: So a case dating back to 1927 is being seen as a precedent for whether the president has to hand over what congressional committees are demanding of him. And so that's a precedent from the Teapot Dome corruption scandal. What was that precedent, and how might it be used in terms of Trump versus congressional investigations? ### LIPTAK: So in that 1927 decision, which involved an investigation of government corruption, the Supreme Court said that congressional inquiries were, quote, ""an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function."" So in English, that means you can't oversee the executive branch without access to information. And that's Congress's job. Congress is in Article I of the Constitution. It makes the laws. The president executes the laws. So in these and other cases, the House starts off in a fairly strong position. ### Now, let me give you a little bit of the arguments going the other way. One of them is, the Trump administration will say, at least as to some of these subpoenas, it's not an authentic legislative task to figure out whether the president committed tax fraud 10 years ago. That has nothing to do with Congress's ability to write tax laws. ### They will also say - and this has some force - that it may be Congress's right, but this is not a matter for the courts. Congress has other tools. The House can deny appropriations. The House can impeach - that this is not something to go to the Supreme Court about, but to use the powers you already have in the Constitution to address a president who's not complying with your demands. ### GROSS: Do you think we're in a constitutional crisis? And I think my larger question is, exactly what is a constitutional crisis? It's an expression I hear all the time. And I've heard at least three or four different definitions about what it is. ### LIPTAK: There's no fixed definition. My editors ask me about once a week, are we in a constitutional crisis? ### GROSS: (Laughter). ### LIPTAK: I mean, one constitutional crisis I can think of is, the Supreme Court says to President Trump - as it said to President Nixon - you must comply with a subpoena. And were President Trump not to comply, that would be a full-blown constitutional crisis. Another kind of... ### GROSS: Because you have two branches of government - Congress versus the executive branch - at odds with each other and no one to decide who wins. ### LIPTAK: Right. If you have a complete breakdown of the complicated, interlocking set of checks and balances that has actually served us very well for more than 200 years - if you just have complete lack of cooperation where, say, the Supreme Court says, Congress wins, and the president says, very interesting you said that; I'm not going to comply - that's a constitutional crisis. We're not particularly close to that. ### Another kind of constitutional crisis I could imagine - let's say a Democrat is elected in 2020, and Republicans continue to control the Senate. And we lose one Supreme Court justice after the other, and nobody is confirmed. You can imagine that kind of constitutional crisis. ### But the term is thrown around a little too loosely. The Constitution is a pretty resilient document. And it may be that we'll be able to muddle our way through even what looks today to be a real crisis not because there haven't been clashes between the branches before - bear in mind that officials of both the George W. Bush and Obama administration were held in contempt by Congress, and those cases went to court and they - over time, they sort of got sorted out. ### But what we have here is, on the one hand, an extremely large number of demands from the House - by the Trump administration's count, more than a hundred - and a complete categorical, totalist (ph), maximalist response by President Trump, who says, we're not complying with any of the subpoenas. Now, if we're to take him at his word - which maybe we shouldn't - that does seem to be the kind of standoff that, if not a constitutional crisis, is a threat to the constitutional order. ### GROSS: So if - somebody would have to bring a case saying that President Trump has to comply with subpoenas or turn over his tax records, and that case would have to make its way to the Supreme Court. ### LIPTAK: Yeah, that's right. But that's underway. I mean, some of those cases are in court. Others will be in court soon enough. One of the cases is already before a federal appeals court, which I think - we'll hear arguments in July, which is fast by legal standards. So this - these cases could reach the court in quite short order. ### GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Liptak, Supreme Court correspondent for the New York Times. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. ### (SOUNDBITE OF JULIAN LAGE GROUP'S ""TELEGRAM"") ### GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Adam Liptak, the Supreme Court correspondent for The New York Times. ### Well, Robert Mueller just broke his silence and made a public statement pertaining to the report and also pertaining to the fact that he's not going to make any more public statements. So what do you feel like you learned from what Mueller said? ### LIPTAK: I think, to a large extent, he set the record straight about the second part of his report, the part involving questions of obstruction of justice by the president. He plainly said that they didn't clear the president. He plainly said that they weren't in a position to indict the president. ### And you put those two things together, and you read between the lines just a little bit. He certainly seems to be suggesting that there is substantial evidence that the House could look at if it were interested in pursuing impeachment charges against the president. And perhaps after the president leaves office, it's possible that a prosecutor might want to consider indicting the president then. ### He's stuck in this weird box where he says, as a matter of Justice Department policy and fundamental fairness, he can't indict the president. But, he says, if I could've cleared him, I would have. And you put those two pieces together, and you go, man, I guess there's some evidence here. ### GROSS: Do you think what Mueller said has any implications for the House committees that are currently investigating the president? ### LIPTAK: I'm not sure it adds anything to a fair reading of the report itself, but some of the commentary around the report and some of the attorney general's summary of the report may have clouded people's understanding of what the report's conclusion, particularly on obstruction, was. And this, you know, crisp, brisk statement from Mueller brings things back into focus. ### GROSS: Do you think Mueller's public comments add anything to the question of, should the president be investigated for obstructing justice, and is that impeachable? ### LIPTAK: No, I think it leaves that conclusion to the House. And the House has complicated calculations to make, some of them legal, some of them political. They are up against the reality that whatever they do, a Republican-controlled Senate is not going to remove the president and the possibility, at least, and maybe even the probability, based on history, based on the Bill Clinton impeachment, that impeaching Trump is actually politically good for Trump. ### So you have conflicting impulses. On the one hand, there's this evidence that looks real of attempts to obstruct an inquiry, and on the other hand, the political reality that the tool the Constitution gives the House - impeachment, an accusation against the president which would be tried in the Senate - is one that is not likely to work and might actually redound to the president's benefit. ### GROSS: If the House decided to impeach President Trump, would that give the House more power to get access to witnesses who Trump has asked not to comply with subpoenas or to information like tax records that the president has decided not to hand over? ### LIPTAK: Very good question, and the answer is an emphatic yes. So congressional subpoenas, when they're merely issued in aid of its legislative responsibilities, can sometimes be overcome. Sometimes courts will allow them, sometimes not. But there's really no question but that the House's power to compel testimony in aid of an impeachment inquiry, as distinguished from legislation, is at its height and that courts are likely to affirm that. And if the president and his associates were to decline to cooperate with subpoenas issued in aid of an impeachment inquiry, they're likely to lose. ### And moreover - and there's historical precedent for this - that would itself be an impeachable offense. So when Nixon declined to comply with congressional subpoenas, the House Judiciary Committee drafted articles of impeachment for that. So it's - there's a chicken and the egg thing here. You get more subpoena power, and a failure to comply with such a subpoena - there's historical precedent for - is itself an impeachable offense when the subpoena comes out of the impeachment inquiry. ### GROSS: So do you think that Robert Mueller just gave the House more reason to - or more evidence for pursuing impeachment? ### LIPTAK: No, I guess I don't go that far. I don't think Mueller said very much beyond what's on the face of the report, although he said it much more crisply. You know, the report is 400 pages long. Almost nobody has read all of it, and the conclusions are a little hard to sort through. ### But in hitting the bullet points, the high points, I don't think he was speaking so much to members of Congress who are - and their staff who are studying this closely. But I think he does put into context for the American public what the basic ground rules here are. ### GROSS: So we have a new court with two Trump appointees - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. You've written about the surprising number of things they have in common. Can you sketch out where their backgrounds intersect? ### LIPTAK: It's sort of extraordinary. They - both of them went to the same Jesuit high school in the suburbs of Washington at the same time. They were two years apart. Kavanaugh was two years ahead of Gorsuch. And then they both went to Ivy League colleges. They both went to Ivy League law schools. They both clerked on the Supreme Court - very prestigious job to be a law clerk to a Supreme Court justice - and a clerk for the same justice - Justice Anthony Kennedy. And they clerked for the same justice in the same term. So their lives have overlapped very closely. ### And then they go on for about a decade each to be appeals court judges, issuing conservative opinions that the conservative legal movement, the Federalist Society loves. They're - make it onto the lists that candidate and then President Trump circulates. They're confirmed by close votes in the Senate. And you would think, you know, we have twins. You know, we have two people who were put in a test tube to be exactly the same person. And they get on the court. And it turns out they're human beings, and they have some significant differences. ### GROSS: What are some of their differences? ### LIPTAK: What - some of it is stylistic. Neil Gorsuch is a big personality - folksy, a showy writer, a kind of - how to say this nicely - on the bench, he sometimes have - has a certain self-satisfied air. He arrived on the job and felt very comfortable on the job almost immediately. So that's one set of stylistic approaches to the job. ### Brett Kavanaugh, so far, has been much more modest, workmanlike. A good, crisp writer, but not one with a lot of flair. And a sort of straight-ahead questioner on the bench. So there are stylistic differences. ### But more importantly, there are interpretive differences. They approach the Constitution and statutes a little differently. Gorsuch, who seems to be the more conservative of the two, is very much an originalist, meaning he wants to figure out what the Constitution meant when it was adopted, and a textualist, meaning he only cares about the words of the statute Congress passed and not about what the purpose of the statute was, not about what the consequences of a given ruling might be. ### Kavanaugh - and the evidence is thin. He's only been on the court for a little bit - seems much more pragmatic, seems much more open to saying, well, what makes sense here? What's the workable, sensible answer to this question. Sure, you can interpret it this way. You can interpret it that way. But which way is America better off? ### And that has caused them, on not a few occasions, to be on the other side of some cases. Not the biggest cases, but still enough to illuminate the differences. ### GROSS: Are you sensing a growing amount of tension between the justices? You used the word rancorous in (laughter) a recent article. ### LIPTAK: Very much so, and especially in the area of the death penalty. The liberal justices and the conservative justices are deeply divided on issues that arise in last-minute stays, requests, in death penalty cases. Justice Breyer, who is not easily angered, wrote a bitter dissent at 3 o'clock in the morning, saying his colleagues wouldn't even wait till the morning to discuss a case with him. And over and over again, the right side of the court has said that there are abuses in death penalty litigations and people are bringing groundless claims at the last minute in a kind of cynical gamesmanship. ### And the left side of the court is saying, wait a second, these are serious issues. They involve life or death. Why don't we consider them in a deliberate way? And where, when Justice Kennedy was on the court, he seemed to be a moderating force - he would sometimes go one way, sometimes go the other. Always keep it civil - now there's a level of rancor and anger on the court, which is quite new. ### GROSS: How is that being expressed? In writing, or in discussions? What access do you have to that? ### LIPTAK: Well, it's certainly been discussed in a whole series of opinions, including - and this is so weird - opinions issued weeks after the fact. They keep relitigating these issues. And in a different case, they'll drop a footnote about the old case. And so they can't let it go. ### And they have even on occasion, again, in writing, sort of opened the curtain on behind-the-scenes deliberations on how they can't even get along well enough to sit down together to discuss something. So you're seeing a new era at the court. This is a court in transition, and it's a little rocky. ### GROSS: So Justice Kennedy had been considered the swing vote in the Supreme Court, and he's retired. So Justice Roberts, the chief justice, is now seen as the swing vote. How swingy has he been? Like, what can you learn from his recent decisions? ### LIPTAK: Justice Kennedy, although basically conservative, leaned left in important areas like abortion and affirmative action and, most importantly, gay rights. Those are not areas in which the chief justice is likely to go in a liberal direction. ### But there have been a couple of instances where the chief justice has joined the four liberals to make up a 5-4 majority. One of them involved a case about an abortion restriction out of Louisiana which the chief justice, agreeing with the liberals, provisionally blocked. ### A second one involved a Trump administration asylum policy where, again, the chief justice with the four liberals, in a 5-4 decision, blocked. Chief Justice Roberts is a very smart and savvy man, and I'm sure he's thinking very carefully about how to thread the needle between what, on the one hand, is an impulse to move the court to the right and is, on the other hand, an impulse to be cautious and to guard the institutional reputation of his court. ### GROSS: Adam Liptak, thank you so much for coming back to FRESH AIR. It's always a pleasure to have you on our show. Thank you. ### LIPTAK: It's always great to be here, Terry. Thank you. ### GROSS: Adam Liptak is the Supreme Court correspondent for The New York Times. ### After we take a short break, jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will review a new album by drummer Jeff Williams, who's played with Stan Getz and Joe Lovano.

8985,washingtonpost.com,2019-05-31T07:50:25-04:00,"Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) ### On The Hill ### For now, congressional Republicans, ardent free-traders that some claim to be, have remained largely silent while on recess from Washington. ### One major opponent already, though, is Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the powerful Senate Finance Committee. ### “Trade policy and border security are separate issues,” Grassley said in a statement. “This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent. Following through on this threat would seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA, a central campaign pledge of President Trump’s and what could be a big victory for the country.” ### Grassley, you might remember, took to the Wall Street Journal op-ed page to deliver an ultimatum to Trump in April, telling Trump to end his tariffs on Mexican or Canadian steel and aluminum tariffs or watch the USCMA die. Those tariffs were nixed in a deal just two weeks ago. ### Graham defends Trump: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) sided with Trump (surprise!) and defended the tariffs. In turn, Graham, who is running for reelection next year, also became the latest victim of there’s always a tweet: ### Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad. (2) ### — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 26, 2017 ### The worst possible time: The oddest part about Trump’s announcement is that it comes just as Mexico, Canada and the United States are marshaling their respective legislatures to ratify the USMCA. ### Mexico: Earlier Thursday, AMLO  submitted the deal to the Mexican Senate. ### Canada: Vice President Pence was in Canada to meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and sell the accord. Just a day earlier, officials there formally presented the USCMA to the Canadian parliament. Time is running short there as lawmakers are expected to head home June 21 in advance of the country’s national elections this October. ### At home: The Trump administration on Thursday moved to start the clock on when it will formally submit the USCMA to Congress. ### “Pelosi directly cautioned U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer not to send the draft report until Democrats had spent more time working with the White House on the plan. And on Thursday, she attacked the White House’s decision to move ahead,” our colleagues Damian Paletta, Erica Werner and Josh Dawsey report . ### China: Trump is already fighting a trade war with China that shows no signs of progress. The possibility the U.S. and Mexico could soon be at loggerheads. ### President Trump gestures as he poses alongside Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May during the opening ceremony of the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) summit on July 11, 2018. (Photo by EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images) ### Global Power ### INSIDE TRUMP’S EUROPE TRIP: Trump’s second visit to the U.K. will be wrapped in royal pomp and circumstance, with some aspects reportedly overseen by Queen Elizabeth II herself. But the trip also comes as the two allies fight over a Chinese telecom giant and British politics are in turmoil over Prime Minister Theresa May’s impending resignation. ### The timing: “The dates for D-Day are pretty fixed,” a senior administration official told reporters on a call previewing the trip. “This is the 75th commemoration . . . the president has said over and over again about the ‘unshakable bond’ between the two countries that even in the most difficult times where you may have political upheaval and uncertainty that you need to stand together shoulder to shoulder.” ### Trump’s shadow: We don't know who will succeed May, but Trump might meet with one of the candidates vying to fill the role, such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. There’s also the possibility he could seek a tete-a-tete with controversial Brexit Party head Nigel Farage. ### Protests: Trump’s “working visit” to the U.K. last year turned out hundreds of thousands of protesters across London, above whom hovered the infamous Trump balloon. The Evening Standard cited a YouGov poll finding that 54 percent of Londoners oppose Trump’s visit. Protests, including the balloon, are expected again. ### What May and Trump will discuss: ### Huawei: The U.S. is pressuring the U.K. to reject Huawei's involvement in 5G networks after the U.S. government put Huawei on a so-called “trade blacklist” and is warning publicly that allowing the  company access to critical networks runs the risk the Chinese government could one day use the position for surveillance or leverage. ### A U.K. official told Bloomberg’s Margaret Talev and Josh Wingrove that Huawei is indeed on the agenda. ### A trade deal: Brexit has still yet to become a reality, but soon enough the U.K. will be looking to strike its own bilateral trade deal with Trump. CNN’s Ivana Kottasová reported in March the Trump administration’s wish list includes “comprehensive access” for agricultural goods, which translates into allowing “genetically modified crops, animal feed with antibiotics and chlorine-washed chicken products that are banned in the European Union but common in the United States.” ### What it’s like to be in the room: Former French Ambassador to the U.S. Gérard Araud gave a frank interview to Politico’s Nahal Toosi, speaking about what it's like to deal with Trump and just how “special” the U.S.-U.K. relationship remains. “At no moment has the fact of being an ally in anyway prevented Trump from trying to twist the arm of the other side,” Araud said. “The special relationship was more special on the British side than the American side.” ### Some highlights from the schedule: ### June 3: Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrive in London where the queen will host them at Buckingham Palace for an arrival ceremony. They will later travel to Westminster Abbey. The day will conclude with the queen’s state dinner in honor of the president. ### June 4: Trump meets with May and the pair will also meet with American and British business leaders. ### June 5: Trump travels to Portsmouth, the first of two events he is attending to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day. The president later travels to Ireland for a meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. ### June 6: Trump travels to Normandy for a D-Day commemoration at an American cemetery.

It should not be taken in again. ### By Joshua A. Geltzer ### Mr. Geltzer is the executive director and a visiting professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. ### May 31, 2019 ### Image ### Demonstrators outside the Supreme Court in April protested the proposed addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census.CreditCreditMandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images ### The Supreme Court is poised to decide one of its most divisive cases since litigation around the travel ban: the challenge to the Trump administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. ### Even as the justices deliberate on this case, shocking new reporting offers critical support to opponents of the administration’s position. It strongly suggests that the justification from Trump administration lawyers, in their presentation before the Supreme Court, for adding a census question on citizenship was an outright falsehood, or at the least a deliberate pretext. A recently deceased Republican strategist, whose 2015 study showed that adding a citizenship question to the census would supercharge pro-Republican gerrymandering, provided the actual rationale and wrote key language that informed a Justice Department letter claiming that the citizenship question was needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act. ### We have seen this drama before. Last year, the Supreme Court faced similar questions of blatant misrepresentation from the Trump administration in the case on the travel ban. The court overlooked the sketchy details in that case and decided in the administration’s favor. ### In this term’s most important matter, the court should not be taken in. ### During the travel ban case, I remember sitting in the courtroom astonished when the solicitor general claimed to the justices that President Trump had “made crystal-clear” that he had “no intention of imposing the Muslim ban” — a ban that, as a candidate, Mr. Trump had repeatedly promised. ### In such a case, the justices look for evidence of animus against a particular group. And so establishing the connection between Mr. Trump’s pervasive anti-Muslim remarks and the ban he promulgated was a core aspect of the challengers’ argument. ### Ultimately, the conservative justices in the majority voted to uphold the ban, deciding that it was a valid exercise of the president’s authority. ### In the census case, which the Supreme Court will soon decide, the administration was challenged on the grounds that the addition of a citizenship question violated proper administrative procedures and would violate, by design, the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by discriminating against minority groups and immigrants, especially of certain nationalities. ### In three federal lawsuits, judges have ruled against the administration’s action. ### Much as I was taken aback a year ago as the travel ban case was argued, during argument day for the census case I was astonished to hear the solicitor general insist that the question’s addition was intended to facilitate enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. The facts brought out at trial made clear that this was a mere pretext for a pre-existing commitment to adding a citizenship question. ### The information recently revealed from the Republican strategist confirms in dramatic fashion what the trial record already showed: The Trump administration’s actual reason for the citizenship question is entrenching Republican political power. Adding the question, according to opponents of the move, would deter many immigrants from participating in the census and thus from being counted, which would in turn help Republicans. ### A letter filed on Thursday with the Supreme Court rightly says that adding the question began as an effort “to create a structural electoral advantage” for “‘Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.’” And a judge in the United States District Court in Manhattan, who had ruled against adding the question, set a hearing for next week to evaluate, among other implications, whether these documents mean that key witnesses lied during trial. The hearing may produce stark evidence directly relevant to the Supreme Court’s handling of the case. ### On Thursday, the Justice Department said that the new information was merely “a last-ditch effort to derail the Supreme Court’s consideration of this case” and added that the 2015 study had “played no role” in the department’s request to reinstate a citizenship question. ### The Justice Department also said that it will explain itself in a court filing. Perhaps there’s some explanation for why this isn’t the smoking gun it appears to be. But we already have a shooting gallery of smoking guns from the trial record demonstrating that the Trump administration’s justification was mere pretext. The new evidence has made it, at a minimum, a lot smokier. ### The legitimacy of our judicial system depends on judges and justices deciding cases on the facts — the real facts, not a distortion of them offered by one party to a case. ### The Supreme Court now faces a choice: How will a majority of the justices handle another attempt by the Trump administration to mislead the court? There is a sad history, dating at least as far back as the infamous Korematsu decision during World War II — a shameful decision upholding the forcible relocation and internment of Japanese-Americans — of the court reaching unfortunate decisions based on misrepresentations by the government that are later proved false. ### But there’s still time for the court to get the census case right by looking past the pretext to the Trump administration’s real motivation for adding a citizenship question. For the sake of its own legitimacy, the court must do so and avoid getting snookered by Trump’s lawyers. ### The census question"
10250,npr.org,2019-05-31T07:53:43-04:00,"Email ### AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: ### There are new revelations today in the legal battle over the citizenship question the Trump administration wants to add to the 2020 census. Court filings suggest the administration pushed to add the question so political maps could be redrawn to favor Republicans and non-Hispanic white people. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang has been covering this legal battle from the beginning. He joins us now from New York. And Hansi, first, just remind us what the citizenship question asks, why it sparked so many legal challenges? ### HANSI LO WANG: This is a question that asks, is this person a citizen of the United States? The Trump administration wants to include it on forms to be asked of every household in the country next year. And the concern here is that Census Bureau research has shown that it's highly likely that including this question would depress participation in the census among households with noncitizens, and that includes some citizens. And it's important to remember the stakes here - if people don't participate in the census or not enough people, that affects the accuracy of census numbers that are used to draw voting districts at the state and local level after 2020. ### And so far, three federal judges have blocked the citizenship question from being added. This issue is now at the Supreme Court. And all along, the administration has been saying that they wanted this question to better enforce Voting Rights Act's protections for racial and language minorities. What's interesting here is that these new documents, filed today by the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, suggests that Trump administration officials were aware that adding this question would reduce the political power of Latinx people. ### CORNISH: So what are these documents? What exactly do they say? ### WANG: Well, these are documents from the files of a major GOP redistricting strategist. His name is Thomas Hoffler. He died last year. And he was commissioned in 2015 to do a study about what could be done with a citizenship question, and he also concluded that adding a question about citizenship status on the census could ultimately help improve - boost the power of Republicans and nonwhite Hispanics through the redrawing of maps. ### And then, also, these documents included a document that had a paragraph, word for word, that was included in a draft letter, requesting a citizenship question that the Trump administration used as part of its process of adding this question to the census forms. And the plaintiffs' attorneys here say that this is all evidence that suggests that Hoffler was involved in this push for a citizenship question, and that it was done to help benefit the Republicans. ### CORNISH: Do we know why these documents are being released now? ### WANG: You know, what's interesting is these documents, they - the attorneys obtained them through Hoffler's estranged daughter, who, after Hoffler died, she got hold of a hard drive, included his personal files. And this daughter happened to get connected with lawyers for another lawsuit on another case about a redistricting map, and the lawyers happened to be in the same law firm involved in the citizenship question lawsuits. And so the timing here is just how these documents came to light. ### You know, it's important to keep in mind that we're weeks away from when the Supreme Court is expected to announce its decision on whether or not the Trump administration can add the citizenship question. And I should note, I have reached out to all the federal agencies involved in these cases - no responses so far on the record. ### CORNISH: But to go back to something, how could today's news affect that Supreme Court ruling? ### WANG: You know, we'll have to see. You know, so far, the judge in New York at a lower court has scheduled a hearing about all these issues on June 5. The plaintiffs' attorneys basically say that these documents showed the administration has concealed Hoffler's role in the citizenship question, this push for a citizenship question, and that administration officials may have provided misleading or - testimony or lied about Hoffler's role during their testimony for the lawsuits. And the attorneys have notified the Supreme Court about this hearing on June 5. We'll have to see how that might affect the Supreme Court's ruling, ultimately. ### CORNISH: That's NPR's Hansi Lo Wang. Hansi, thank you for your reporting. ### WANG: You're welcome. ### Copyright © 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

12769,chron.com,2019-05-31T15:32:10-04:00,"Census citizenship question could transform state elections ### Paul J. Weber and Geoff Mulvihill, Associated Press ### Updated ### 1:52 pm CDT, Friday, May 31, 2019 ### AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Computer files discovered in the home of a Republican operative who died last year contain a blueprint for how the GOP could extend its domination of legislatures in states where growing Latino populations favor Democrats and offer compelling context about a related case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. ### The files from North Carolina redistricting expert Tom Hofeller include detailed calculations that lay out gains Republicans would see in Texas by basing legislative districts on the number of voting-age citizens rather than the total population. But he said that would be possible only if the Census asked every household about its members' immigration status for the first time since 1950. ### The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on that question as early as next month. But Republicans who support adding the citizenship question have rarely acknowledged any partisan political motive. The emergence of the documents now could figure heavily in the case the court is considering. ### To civil liberties lawyers suing to block the question, it's now clear that partisan politics were at work all along. They assert in court filings that Hofeller not only laid out the political benefit for the GOP but also ghost-wrote a U.S. Department of Justice letter calling on the Census Bureau to add an immigration question to next year's survey. ### The Justice Department denied the allegations in a statement on Thursday, saying Hofeller's Texas analysis ""played no role in the Department's December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census."" In that 2017 letter, Justice said it needed citizenship information to protect the voting rights of minorities. ### The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the citizenship question in April and is expected to rule by July whether it will be allowed. ### ""What it would result in is outrageously overpopulated and underpopulated districts,"" said Matt Angle, a Democratic redistricting strategist, adding that the resulting maps would harm Texas' booming Hispanic population with the aim of benefiting Republicans. ### Many of the state's top Republicans, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , have publicly expressed support for a citizenship question on the Census. On Friday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's office did not respond to questions about whether he would endorse using citizenship data to draw new maps, although a spokeswoman said last year that the Census question would provide greater transparency and was dismissive of fears of under-reporting. ### Opponents contend that many noncitizens and their relatives will shy away from being counted, fearing that law enforcement will be told of individuals' citizenship status. That could cause undercounts in places with large Latino populations, including parts of Texas, California, Florida and Arizona, and could cost them seats in Congress as well as federal funding. ### But the political impact of the citizenship question could go beyond an undercount if states use citizenship information to draw the maps for state legislative districts. The concept was introduced in legislation over the last few years in Missouri and Nebraska, where the state constitution already calls for excluding ""aliens"" from its apportionment. And Alabama has sued the federal government saying it should supply citizenship information. ### In Texas, Hofeller calculated in his report that about a half-dozen Latino-dominated districts would disappear, including a portion of one in the Dallas area, up to two in Houston's Harris County and two or three in the border counties of South Texas. ""A switch to the use of citizen voting age population as the redistricting population base for redistricting would be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,"" he wrote. ### There's a question of whether the switch would be legal. ### The U.S. Constitution specifies that congressional districts should be based on how many people — not citizens — live there. But it's murkier for many state legislative districts. ### The case at the heart of Hofeller's 2015 report was brought by Texas voters who contended it was unfair that noncitizens and minors were counted in making legislative districts because it gave a bigger voice to a smaller number of eligible voters in places with a lot of noncitizens and children. In response, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that states could not be forced to use voting-age citizens as the basis for districting. ### Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with that decision but wrote a separate opinion that seems to invite states to do it on their own. ""It instead leaves states significant leeway in apportioning their own districts to equalize total population, to equalize eligible voters, or to promote any other principle consistent with a republican form of government,"" Thomas wrote. ### If a state tried to use a limited population count for redistricting, a lawsuit would be likely. ### ""They're always trying to argue that only citizens should be counted for drawing the lines. They think it's to their advantage,"" said Luis Vera, a San Antonio-based lawyer for the League of United Latin American Citizens who has spent decades in court with the state over redistricting battles and said he'd sue if Texas switched to citizen-based districts. ### Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said lawmakers may be reluctant to change which count is used for redistricting knowing they'd face legal challenges. ### He said that even if a switch could be approved under a state constitution, it could run afoul of the federal Voting Rights Act, which bars state and local governments from restricting equal voting access based on race. ### But Rogelio Sáenz, a sociologist at the University of Texas-San Antonio, said he expects it will be considered in Texas, where Democrats picked up 12 seats in the House last year, now giving them 67 of the 150. ### ""The Republican Party is really anxious to gain back those few seats they lost in the last election,"" Sáenz said. ### ___"
14721,yahoo.com/news,2019-05-31T06:20:15-04:00,"• ### May 30, 2019 ### With the Supreme Court thought to be weeks away from ruling on whether a citizenship question can be included in the 2020 census, newly discovered documents suggest that the reason the Trump administration sought to add it in the first place was to provide political advantage to “Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.” ### Found on a computer hard drive of Republican redistricting expert Thomas Hofeller by his estranged daughter following his death last August, the documents appear to show the deep political roots of the citizenship question. They include a 2015 study concluding that a census count only of citizens would provide a better way to gerrymander congressional districts that favor Republicans. “Without a question on citizenship being included on the 2020 Decennial Census questionnaire,” Mr. Hofeller wrote in excerpts published Thursday by the  New York Times,  “the use of citizen voting age population is functionally unworkable.” ### Photo Illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP, Shutterstock, census.gov ### More ### Since December 2017, when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross formally requested that the Census Bureau add the citizenship question, opponents have argued that its inclusion would discourage immigrants and minority group members from participating, which would in turn result in a lower population count — and a reduction in political power — in areas more likely to vote Democratic. Ross’s statement that the question was necessary to better enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was just a pretext, those opponents have said, with the real goal being a political one. ### Also found on the hard drive was a draft of a letter by Hofeller justifying the question as needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act. Some of the language of that letter later appeared in requests from Ross to include the controversial question. ### Stephanie Hofeller turned the hard drive over to lawyers for the plaintiffs in a separate gerrymandering case,  Common Cause  v. Lewis, which involves controversial electoral maps in North Carolina. Those lawyers were also representing opponents to the citizenship question in the Department of Commerce v. State of New York, which is now before the Supreme Court. ### “The evidence reveals that the plan to add the citizenship question was hatched by Republicans’ chief redistricting mastermind to create an electoral advantage,” Common Cause president Karen Hobert Flynn said in a statement. “This contradicts testimony by administration officials that they wanted to add the question to benefit Latino voters, when in fact the opposite was true.” ### Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP) ### More ### The census is conducted every 10 years in the United States as set forth by the Constitution, which requires an “actual enumeration,” in order to apportion seats in the House of Representatives based on “the whole number of persons in each state.” ### The citizenship question has not been asked of respondents since 1950, and then was only asked of the subgroup that was randomly assigned the “long-form” version of the questionnaire. If allowed by the high court, this would be the first time in history that everyone living in the United States would be asked if they were a citizen. ### Experts estimate that 6.5 million people would not be counted in the 2020 census if the question were to be included, and that several states — specifically Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas — would, as a result, lose seats in Congress and federal funding of programs based on population. A suit in New York aiming to block the question was heard by the Supreme Court in April. At that time, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the value of the citizenship information in enforcing the Voting Rights Act offset any potential harm caused by depressed participation rates among immigrants and minority groups. The government also directly rebuffed arguments saying that the link to voting rights was a fabricated rationalization. ### Court observers believe that the court’s new conservative majority seemed inclined to accept the administration’s argument that the question was necessary, and not political. A suit filed Thursday in Southern District Court of New York, which ruled in favor of those who would block the inclusion of the question, asks Judge Jesse M. Furman to bring “sanctions or other appropriate relief” in light of the new documents, even as the Supreme Court considers the appeal of his decision. ### The Supreme Court ends its session at the end of June. The timing is significant because the final census forms are scheduled to be printed that same month. ### _____"

She has since turned over the documents to Common Cause, one of the groups suing to block the question. ### The files show that Hofeller authored an analysis detailing how adding a census citizenship question would help Republicans draw up even more extreme gerrymandered maps. He later repeatedly pushed the Trump administration to justify adding the question by dubiously arguing  that it was necessary to enforcing the 1965 Voting Rights Act. ### The files revealed that Hofeller was hired in 2015 by the  Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news outlet owned by billionaire Republican donor Paul Singer, to study how to implement political maps that only looked at U.S. citizens of voting age, rather than a state’s total population. ### Hofeller analyzed Texas state legislative maps and determined that maps based only on the number of U.S. citizens “would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats” and “would be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites,” according to court filings . ### Hofeller wrote that implementing these maps without adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census would be “functionally unworkable.” ### Just over a year later, Hofeller urged Trump’s transition team to add a citizenship question, according to former transition official Mark Neuman’s testimony to investigators last year. ### Advertisement: ### Neuman, a longtime friend of Hofeller who later became an informal adviser on census issues to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, testified that Hofeller told him that using the question was necessary to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act and increase Hispanic political representation, even though he had argued exactly the opposite in his study just months earlier. The Census Bureau itself concluded that adding a citizenship question would likely lead to a 5.1 percent decrease in response rates from noncitizen households. ### Files found on Hofeller’s computer also show that he was behind the Trump administration’s claims in court that the question was necessary to enforcing the Voting Rights Act. One paragraph that Hofeller wrote later appeared word for word in a draft letter from the Justice Department to the Census Bureau calling on the agency to add the question. ### Justice Department official John Gore , who oversees civil rights and voting rights issues, told Congress earlier this year that Neuman gave him the draft in October 2017. ### Groups seeking to block the question argued in court filings that the final Justice Department memo to the Census Bureau uses the same arguments in the same order as Hofeller’s study, alleging that Neuman “falsely testified” about the Justice Department’s actions on the citizenship question. ### Advertisement: ### The citizenship question has already been blocked by multiple federal judges but is now before the Supreme Court, which is expected to issue a ruling in June. The Supreme Court’s conservatives appeared likely to allow the question to move forward when they heard arguments last month. It’s unclear whether the conservative majority on the court will be swayed by the new revelations that the Trump administration’s justification for the question was based on a lie and the question itself was a ploy to help Republicans cement electoral majorities. ### “Should a majority of the Supreme Court rule in Trump’s favor, in other words, they will do so despite abundant evidence that the Trump administration knew, explicitly, that it was engaged in an underhanded campaign to rig future elections for white Republicans,” Ian Millhiser wrote at ThinkProgress . “And they will do so despite the administration’s disregard for laws governing how new policy decisions must be made.” "

(J. Scott Applewhite / Associated Press) ### It is rare that plaintiffs challenging a government policy can locate smoking-gun evidence regarding the illicit motives of government decision makers. Yet for the second year in a row at the Supreme Court, a group of plaintiffs — this time challenging the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 census — has produced evidence that the Trump administration deliberately adopted a policy to put minorities at a disadvantage. ### If the past is any indicator, the court is going to discount that evidence and explain why it doesn’t matter. But the rest of us shouldn’t forget that the administration has discriminated against minorities or that the court lets them get away with it. ### Advertisement ### As a general rule, plaintiffs challenging a government policy have to show the policy places disproportionate burdens on a particular group and that the government intended to place the group at a disadvantage. This means government decision makers know they should avoid spelling out their intent to discriminate against a particular group. ### President Trump’s administration never got that message. As a candidate, Trump announced a plan to prevent Muslims from coming to the United States. A week after taking office, he signed an executive order banning people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. while allowing entry for religious minorities (such as Christians) from those countries. ### Advertisement ### If the past is any indicator, the court is going to discount that evidence and explain why it doesn’t matter. ### Share quote & link ### The president’s order underwent a few iterations — the final version added a few countries and modified some justifications. When the order finally made its way to the high court last year, the plaintiffs argued that the president’s stated promise to discriminate against Muslims attempting to enter the United States, along with the initial order and many other statements, demonstrated he intended to discriminate against Muslims. ### The court showed it didn’t care. The court upheld the order and cited a confusing ground — that there was a reasonable way to understand the order as having a legitimate justification, even if the order did not actually have one. And the court said it was reasonable to understand the order as legitimate, since the president justified it on the basis of national security. ### This year, the court is once again faced with ruling on a policy that will put minorities at a disadvantage — the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 census. And once again, the plaintiffs challenging the policy have evidence showing the administration declared its intent to discriminate against minorities. ### On Thursday, the plaintiffs challenging the census filed a letter explaining they had discovered by happenstance that a longtime Republican redistricting specialist had played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question. The specialist had previously advocated adding the question on the ground it would give an advantage to “Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.” He drafted a letter from the Department of Justice requesting the addition of the question, and the letter the department ultimately sent bore “striking similarities” to the specialist’s language and argument. ### Advertisement ### The administration has argued that the citizenship question would help it to enforce the Voting Rights Act. There is little question the administration is lying about its reasons for adding the question. The Trump administration has shown no interest in enforcing the act, and citizenship information wouldn’t help it do so. The citizenship question would reduce response rates in immigrant communities, making the census less accurate and the Voting Rights Act harder to enforce. ### However, as the entry ban case makes clear, the plaintiffs challenging the addition of the question won’t prevail just because the administration is lying. The issue is what it would take to persuade this court to acknowledge that the administration is lying. Based on the entry ban case, we know it will take more than just an earlier statement of a discriminatory purpose."
16223,dailymail.co.uk,2019-05-31T07:56:56-04:00,"e-mail ### By Brendan Pierson ### NEW YORK, May 30 (Reuters) - The Trump administration concealed evidence that its proposal to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 U.S. census was intended to help Republicans draw favorable electoral maps, according to immigrant advocacy groups that sued the administration over the question last year. ### In a filing in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, the groups said that the administration hid the fact during the course of the lawsuit that went to trial last year that Thomas Hofeller, a longtime Republican specialist on drawing electoral districts, played a ""significant role"" in planning the citizenship question. ### The conservative-majority Supreme Court is due to issue a final ruling by the end of June on whether the question can be added in time for next year's census. ### The challengers notified the high court about the new documents in a letter filed at the court on Thursday afternoon. They did not ask the Supreme Court to take any specific action. ### The plaintiffs, which include the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee and Make The Road New York, learned of Hofeller's role after his files came to light in separate litigation in North Carolina in which Republican-drawn electoral districts are being challenged. ### A Justice Department representative said the allegations were a ""last-ditch effort to derail the Supreme Court´s consideration of this case."" ### ""The Department looks forward to responding in greater detail to these baseless accusations in its filing on Monday,"" the person said. ### Manhattan-based U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman blocked the question's inclusion following the trial, but the Supreme Court appeared poised to overturn that ruling at April's oral argument. ### According to Thursday's filing, Hofeller concluded in a 2015 study that asking census respondents whether they are U.S. citizens ""would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats"" and ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites"" in redistricting. ### Hofeller went on to ghostwrite a draft letter from the U.S. Department of Justice to the Department of Commerce, asking for a citizenship question on the grounds it would help enforce voting rights, according to the plaintiffs. ### The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, said that administration officials gave false testimony about the origin of the question during the lawsuit, and have asked Furman to consider imposing unspecified sanctions against them. ### Furman has scheduled a hearing on the request for June 5. ### Reuters reported in April that the Trump administration believed its citizenship question could help Republicans in elections by enabling states to draw electoral maps based only on citizen population, rather than total population. ### Opponents have said a citizenship question would cause a sizeable undercount by deterring immigrant households and Latinos from filling out the census forms, out of fear the information would be shared with law enforcement. That would, they argue, cost Democratic-leaning areas electoral representation in Congress and federal aid, benefiting President Donald Trump´s fellow Republicans and Republican-leaning parts of the country. ### (Reporting by Brendan Pierson and Andrew Chung in New York; Additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Tom Brown and Lisa Shumaker) ### Advertisement"
