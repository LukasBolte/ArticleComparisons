At the Pointe du Hoc, where Allied forces had to scale cliffs to silence Nazis guns, the limestone and clay cliffs have eroded but remains of the fortified location part of Germany's Atlantic Wall defensive system are a powerful vestige of WWII. David Vincent AP Photo ### SAINTE-MERE-EGLISE, France ### Seventy-five years ago, American paratrooper John Steele dangled from a clock tower in Sainte-Mere-Eglise after his parachute got caught during the D-Day invasion, and survived. ### Gunfire and shots have long ceased in the little town close to Utah Beach that is home to the Airborne Museum, but a mannequin and parachute still hang from the belfry to honor Steele and the Allied soldiers who died in the D-Day landings. ### Using a drone, The Associated Press has produced a series of stunning aerial pictures and videos revisiting landmark D-Day sites, including Sainte-Mere-Eglise, the first town liberated by U.S. forces in Normandy. ### In the nearby cemetery of Colleville-sur-Mer, where 9,387 fallen U.S. fighters are buried, rows of white crosses and Stars of David are a strong reminder of the sacrifices made by some 156,000 Allied soldiers - mostly American, British and Canadian - who took part in the invasion, storming in from the English Channel and opening a Western front against the Nazis. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to The Charlotte Observer content across all your devices. \n",

Dish has been today's biggest beneficiary of the speculation, rising against a sharply lower market. ### A sale of Boost Mobile has emerged as a likely prospect to get Justice Dept. merger approval that recently seemed in doubt, due to the potential dominance that a combined Sprint and T-Mobile would have in the prepaid wireless space. ### Faber now puts odds of DOJ approval on Sprint/T-Mobile at 50%. \n",

It is backed by a 1.2 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) fund, half financed by the federal government and half by the auto industry. ### Announcing the extension on Friday, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said that \"we need continuity in support\" for electric cars. The incentives will continue at their current level: buyers of purely electric cars will continue to get 4,000 euros and people buying plug-in hybrids will get 3,000 euros. ### Altmaier said applications for the incentives have been rising \"but more slowly than we had hoped.\" ### In this Tuesday, May 14, 2019 photo an e-Golf car is fixed with a charging station during a press tour at the plant of the German manufacturer Volkswagen AG (VW) in Zwickau, Germany.

      "13053 4 9 Print ### On May 23, the Senate passed a $19.1 billion disaster relief bill on a bipartisan 85-8 vote . President Donald Trump has said he will sign the measure. This should be excellent news for victims of devastating wildfires in California, massive flooding in the Midwest, and a series of tornadoes and hurricanes in Dixie Alley in the South. ### But on three occasions since the House went on recess last week, procedural attempts to pass the relief bill with a unanimous consent vote failed despite backing from GOP leadership because of objections by a single Republican lawmaker — first Chip Roy of Texas, then Thomas Massie of Kentucky and most recently , John Rose of Tennessee on Thursday. Among other things, they argue that it’s fiscally irresponsible to authorize more federal spending that adds to the national debt. ### Yes, it’s true that Congress and the Trump administration need to improve on their horrible record on deficit spending. But given that House Republicans overspend as profligately as anyone — and given that the Democratic-controlled House is sure to pass disaster relief on a roll call vote when it returns from recess next week — Roy, Massie and Rose are the irresponsible ones in this situation. ### If they want to prove they’re not just grandstanding, then they should start objecting to the much bigger spending measures the GOP has supported in recent years. Otherwise, all they’ve done is delay much-needed disaster relief to everyday Americans. \n",

McDowell was a second-round pick of the Seahawks in 2017, but never played a snap for Seattle after suffering serious injuries in an ATV accident prior to the start of training camp before his rookie season. ### According to the lawsuit, an arbitration hearing last February found that McDowell had \"breached paragraph 3 of his NFL Player Contract,\" and as a result was ordered to repay his signing bonus within 30 days. The Seahawks say they have not been paid. ### McDowell was waived by Seattle in March after spending the past two seasons on the non-football injury list. ### The Detroit News first reported the lawsuit. ### ___ \n",

(AP) — Hundreds of demonstrators filed into the Louisiana State Capitol a day after lawmakers passed a strict new abortion ban that Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards has signed into law. ### Many on Thursday wore bright pink T-shirts reading \"We Stand With Planned Parenthood\" on the front and \"We Won't Back Down\" on the back, in protest of the so-called heartbeat bill. The measure bars abortions once there's a detectable fetal heartbeat, as early as the sixth week of pregnancy. ### Demonstrators, some with babies in tow, filled the Capitol's lobby even though they couldn't chant or bring signs inside. Many said policymakers have proven they're against women and women's health and said that despite the ban, abortions will continue but just won't be safe. ### Later Thursday, Edwards announced he had signed the measure. \n",

While we won’t go into the epic upsets (and disappointing) lip-synchs for the coveted crown between the four competing drag queens — Silky Nutmeg Ganache, Brook Lynn Hytes, Yvie Oddly and A’Keria C. Davenport — there was more than one surprise. And we don’t just mean when Yvie revealing the words “Free Britney!” written on her underwear during her onstage acrobatics to Rihanna’s “SOS.” ### Christine and the Queens also performed a remixed version of RuPaul’s hit “Sissy that Walk” track as a line of Drag Race “legends” walked the runway in full fashion regalia. Chris, dressed in a red silk organza jacket with poofy sleeves over a red body suit, brought her own genderfuck flair while she got to sing, “My pussy is on fire, now kiss the flame,” to an audience of screaming queens popping fans, strutting and crying their eyes out. ### Related stories ### Hear Miley Cyrus' New EP 'She Is Coming' ### Prior to Thursday night’s pre-recorded Drag Race performance, Chris and Charli XCX performed “Gone,” a new track they recorded for Charli XCX ’s new album, live at Primavera Sound in Barcelona on Thursday night — which you can catch on Christine and the Queens’ Instagram stories or below. ### Charli x CHRIStine X Primavera I am once again DEAD #PrimaveraSound pic.twitter.com/7Tgpl3MQ49 \n",

Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a referral to the Justice Department about a message a top United Kingdom national security official delivered to the Trump transition team a week before President Trump’s inauguration. ### Congressional investigators told the Hill that in January 2017 then-U.K. national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant hand-delivered a memo to soon-to-be national security adviser Michael Flynn’s team that asserted the U.K. government had doubts about the credibility of British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Recent reports suggest Steele had briefed British intelligence officials on his dossier after the 2016 presidential election, and the heads of MI5 and MI6 were made aware of the contents of the dossier by late November. ### “A whistleblower recently revealed the existence of a communique from our allies in Great Britain during the early days of the Russia collusion investigation,” Meadows said. \n",

On the surface, you might think Melissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish 's upcoming summer film, The Kitchen , would be a comedy-crime film, in which a team of women band together and hilariously fumble their way through a series of heists — but that couldn't be further from the truth. The film, directed by Andrea Berloff (who wrote Straight Outta Compton), is way more Ocean's 8 than it is Bridesmaids , and that's what makes it so exciting. ### The Kitchen, which is based on the graphic novel from Ollie and Ming Doyle by the same name, tells the story of three women (Elisabeth Moss is also in the cast) who take matters into their own hands after the FBI arrests their mobster husbands. Of course, infiltrating the Irish mob in Hell's Kitchen in the 1970s isn't easy for three women, and they have to work twice as hard as the men to establish their territory and gain respect. They're up for the challenge, though, especially considering their pasts. McCarthy plays Kathy, a mother of two; Moss plays Claire, a housewife who faced abuse for years; Haddish plays Ruby, who's faced adversity her entire life and is considered an \"outsider\" by the mob, Screen Rant reports. ### Advertisement \n",

The group consisted of 1,036 migrants hailing from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, according to Fox News . ### The historic apprehension comes two days after CBP  announced the creation of a new administrative position intended to help address the recent influx of asylum-seekers that have overwhelmed federal resources at the southern border. The new Border Patrol processing-coordinator position, which will be implemented in 2020, is designed to allow Border Patrol agents, 40 percent of whom are now entirely consumed by administrative tasks, to return to law-enforcement operations. ### “I am committed to providing the men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol the resources they need to accomplish their border-security mission,”  said Carla Provost , chief of the U.S. Border Patrol. “Border Patrol Processing Coordinators will take on processing, transportation, and custody responsibilities, which will free up agents for critical law-enforcement operations.” ### Department of Homeland Security officials continue to urge Congress to provide increased resources, and craft policy to allow Border Patrol agents greater autonomy, in order to address the overwhelming number of family units arriving at the border each day seeking asylum. According to border patrol, 58,474 families were apprehended at the border last month alone. ### More from National Review \n",

      "14307 5 9 Letters editor ### The Seattle Times ### The proposed detached accessory dwelling units legislation to be taken up by the Seattle City Council in June will allow up to 12 unrelated residents per lot. This would be a mistake in my view, as it takes the “family” out of single-family zoning. ### Detached accessory dwelling units represent an opportunity for families that cannot afford to purchase a house in a neighborhood like Laurelhurst to actually live in the neighborhood and send their children to Laurelhurst Elementary — thus making school access more equitable. Allowing a large number of unrelated people to reside on one lot doesn’t have the same positive story — it simply turns single-family homes into boardinghouses. ### A single-family home plus two ADUs would have maybe seven bedrooms at most. The current cap of eight unrelated people per lot makes sense given this number of possible bedrooms. A density beyond this is asking too much of this housing type, as in many areas there is not the parking, transit infrastructure or buffer between residences to comfortably accommodate it. ### I urge the Council to keep the current cap of eight rather than increasing to 12. ### Joseph Herrin, architect, Seattle \n",

He finished his career with an NCAA record 231 assists and 149 goals in 68 games for 380 points, second all-time to former Albany star Lyle Thompson (400). ### A senior co-captain in 2019, Taylor, the first goalie to win the award, led the Terps to the national championship. She had a .551 save percentage (217 saves, 177 goals allowed), the best mark of any power five goalie in the country. She was named the NCAA Tournament's most outstanding player after posting 24 saves, 10 in the national championship win over Boston College. She finished her career with an 84-4 record. ### The trophies were awarded Thursday night in a ceremony at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian. ### More from Star Tribune \n",

The treatment is going well, but the doctor advised the national coach to rest in the coming weeks.” ### The DFB does not give details of the accident. German daily BILD reports Loew dropped a dumbbell on his chest while training some weeks ago. ### Assistant coach Marcus Sorg is to take charge of the team for the games in Borisov, Belarus on June 8 and against Estonia in Mainz three days later. ### Loew says, “I am in constant contact with my coaching staff and we will also be in close contact with each other around the two international matches. Marcus Sorg, (goalkeeping coach) Andy Köpke and (team manager) Oliver Bierhoff have a lot of experience together and together we will bridge this short break well.” ### ___ \n",

Later in the day, the company was denied again in court, as Reuters reports that Judge Fern Flanagan Saddler denied its motion to dismiss or stay a lawsuit filed by the Washington D.C. attorney general over the same incident. ### D.C. AG Karl Racine is suing Facebook over many failures , including a claim that it knew Cambridge Analytica had obtained user data over two years before the leak was revealed. According to the district's lawsuit, the CA cache contained info on 340,000 of its residents. ### A court filing in this case revealed there's an email between senior managers indicating they knew about the company's \"improper data-gathering practices\" as early as September 2015, years before it blew up in 2018. Whatever happens in this case, a deal with the EU means Facebook is on hook for future scandals, and a settlement with the FTC could include changes to make CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally liable . \n",

A drop below this level would take the 30-year yield to its lowest since October 2016. ### A regular bond-buying operation conducted by the central bank also supported JGBs. The Bank of Japan on Friday offered to buy 680 billion yen ($6.22 billion) of five- to 40-year bonds. ### ($1 = 109.2400 yen) (Reporting by the Tokyo markets team, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips) ### Advertisement \n",

He asked Tower if there is any proof that having “more weapons” accessible in more places equals greater safety. ### Tower responded, “I am not a student of the data there, so I wouldn’t speculate about that.” ### After admitting he does not know whether expanded carry opportunities make people safer, Tower called for placing further restrictions on licenses for guns: “I certainly have a strong gut feeling that we need to further restrict at least the licensing of guns in this state.”  He is the political analyst for Armed American Radio.
