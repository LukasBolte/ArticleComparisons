That’s up from 45 percent approval in March.

On the other hand, we should not trust the attorney general, with the input of the national intelligence community, to make those kinds of decisions in investigating any illegal or inappropriate activities by the federal government during the earliest stages of the Russia investigation because his decisions might be political. ### While I trust The Post to make good decisions, I also trust the attorney general to do so. However, if any “reporter” discloses classified information that is harmful to the safety or national security of our nation, he or she should be prosecuted. Freedom of the press, like freedom of speech, has limits. For example, you could be prosecuted if you publish the names of our nation’s spies in other countries and get them arrested or killed because you believe the public should know about our spying activities or you just want to make a name for yourself. ### The courts exist to decide these kinds of cases. ### Samuel Podberesky, Riva, Md.  \n",

Once developed to its full potential, the Advanced Super Hornet could perform most of the missions envisioned for the F-35C except penetrating strike—it would have to rely on stand-off weapons for that mission. ### (This first appeared back in 2016.) ### President-elect Donald Trump’s tweet on Dec. 22 —where he stated that he had asked Boeing to “price out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet” because of the sheer expense of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter—was met with derision by journalists and Washington’s political elite. ### While it is true that no version of the F/A-18E/F will ever be able to offer an exact analogue of the F-35’s capabilities, the reaction inside the Beltway was typically biased. Trump’s statement cannot be interpreted exactly literally. More likely, the President-elect was suggesting that a variant of the Super Hornet airframe could meet many of the capabilities that the F-35 offers at a more reasonable price. \n",

His view that an abortion is a more traumatic experience than an unwanted pregnancy is just that — his view. Any woman who faces an unwanted pregnancy and shares that view may make the same choices he imagines he would. But not every woman, or even every mother, will find that his assessment applies to her circumstance. The point is not whether Del Sesto understands why a woman would behave one way rather than another. The point is that, for matters of conscience, we owe each individual the right to decide for herself. ### Janet Stein \n",

But remains of the fortifications that were part of Germany’s Atlantic Wall defensive system are still there, a powerful vestige of WWII. ### And, in a stark contrast to the fury that engulfed Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, today a grassy knoll blends gently into the wide beach, small waves lapping at the shore. ### ___ ### Follow all the AP’s coverage of D-Day at https://apnews.com/WorldWarII ### The Associated Press \n",

Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, said Guatemala’s ambassador to the United States, Manuel Espina, told him Guatemala would be happy to have U.S. troops help secure its northern border. Gonzalez even wrote a letter to Trump encouraging him to send military personnel. ### “Guatemalan president Jimmy Morales has indicated that he would welcome the introduction of U.S. troops on Guatemala’s northern border,” Gonzalez wrote April 16, the Post reported. “If you want to see fewer apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border, I would strongly encourage you to seriously consider President Morales’ offer.” ### Gonzalez said he believes sending 100 U.S. agents to Guatemala won’t be enough to quell the surge, the Post reported. ### Related Stories: \n",

He reminds the attorneys that the president still had warm feelings for Flynn and asks for a “heads-up” if Flynn knew damaging information about the president. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to Miami Herald content across all your devices. \n",

They were reportedly being followed and threatened by an unknown male suspect. ### On Friday, a female carrier was working near the 1100 block of Bedford Avenue SW when “she felt threatened as the suspects drove past her while screaming at her to get in their vehicle.” ### Lt. Dennis Garren said similar situations occurred Thursday on 13th Street NW, Brown Ave NW and 9th Street. ### Postal inspectors are also investigating and say, at this time, all employees are safe and mail is being delivered. ### However, anyone with information is asked to call the U.S. Postal Inspection Service at (877) 876-2455. Witnesses can also report a tip on the Canton police app or by calling (330) 489-3117. ### 40.798947 -81.378447 \n",

      "10001 6 7 WASHINGTON — Prosecutors have released a full transcript of a voicemail from a former Trump lawyer that former national security adviser Michael Flynn said was an attempt to influence his cooperation in the Russia probe. ### The transcript was released Friday in response to a judge's order. ### Excerpts of the conversation were revealed in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia investigation last month. ### The report says that after Flynn began cooperating with the government, a lawyer working for Trump left a message for Flynn's attorneys. He reminds the attorneys that the president still had warm feelings for Flynn and asks for a \"heads-up\" if Flynn knew damaging information about the president. ### Flynn is awaiting sentence after admitting to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. ### More from Star Tribune \n",

      "5768 3 8 Paul Taylor Dance Company ### Illustration by Juan Bernabeu ### Last year was a major time of change for the Paul Taylor Dance Company. In May, Taylor selected the company's next artistic director: Michael Novak, a member of the troupe. Then, in August, Taylor died, at the age of eighty-eight. Now the company has embarked on a new venture, a collaboration with the Orchestra of St. Luke’s, which will illuminate Taylor’s complex relationship with the music of Bach, one that spanned four decades. In three programs at the Manhattan School of Music, June 7-23, the company will perform all six of Taylor’s works set to Bach, plus new ones created by Pam Tanowitz and Margie Gillis. In the earliest and thorniest work, “Junction” (1961), Taylor, then still an experimentalist, prods the limits of the ineffable quality known as musicality—as Taylor once wrote, he felt that steps and music “have the right to ignore each other.” In contrast, the epic “Promethean Fire” (2002) and the joyous “Esplanade” (1975) seem to tap into the music’s very essence—and show how Taylor mellowed with age. \n",

The merged company would produce some 8.7 million vehicles a year, more than General Motors and trailing only Volkswagen and Toyota. ### If Renault's board approves the plan, that would allow for the two sides to enter exclusive merger negotiations.

It is backed by a 1.2 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) fund, half financed by the federal government and half by the auto industry. ### Announcing the extension on Friday, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said that \"we need continuity in support\" for electric cars. The incentives will continue at their current level: buyers of purely electric cars will continue to get 4,000 euros and people buying plug-in hybrids will get 3,000 euros. ### Altmaier said applications for the incentives have been rising \"but more slowly than we had hoped.\" ### More from Star Tribune \n",

The small group of Scouts hiked for six hours on a day when temperatures reached 96 degrees (36 Celsius). ### The report says White weighed 289 pounds (131 kilograms) but “had no known medical history.” ### His family said at the time that the teen loved scouting and he, fellow scouts and their leaders were experienced hikers. ### Copyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

But after hearing special counsel Robert Mueller’s public address on Wednesday, McCabe acknowledged on MSNBC that he changed his mind on the matter. ### “Well, I think that the report makes clear that they did not uncover evidence of that sort of a relationship. So, based on what Director Mueller’s team revealed in their report, I’d have to say no, we still have not seen clear evidence of that,” he said on Thursday. \n",

      "2524 5 6 How Trump's Mexico threat imperils his own economic agenda ### news now The Associated Press — By PAUL WISEMAN - AP Economics Writer ### WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's vow to impose new tariffs on Mexican imports risks sabotaging not just his drive to forge more favorable trade deals but also a U.S. economy that he says has strengthened under his watch. ### Trump's announcement Thursday that he would impose a 5% tax on all Mexican imports on June 10 — and raise it to 25% by Oct. 1 — unless Mexico stopped a surge of Central American migrants into the U.S. would swell the prices Americans pay for countless items from avocadoes to clothes to medical devices. ### His threat, which drew an outcry from a broad span of business groups and political figures, suddenly cast doubt on prospects for a new North American trade agreement. Trump last year negotiated the deal, formally called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. \n",

      "8871 2 5 Follow @ogtedberg ### This moves me: Television cameras captured legendary former MLB slugger Manny Ramirez sitting alone at an Angels-Mariners game in Seattle on Thursday night, Ramirez’s 47th birthday. Wearing a white T-shirt and a branded cap, with his jacket slung over a nearby stadium railing, Manny appeared to be talking via hands-free headphones when the telecast found him in the fifth inning of the game. ### It’s hard to tell, but based on hair alone, it looks like one of Ramirez’s teenage sons might be sitting in the row in front of him in the clip, meaning there’s some chance Manny just slipped back a row to take a phone call and wasn’t actually there by himself. But I choose to believe otherwise. I want the truth to be that Manny Ramirez, asked by his family how he’d like to spend his birthday, requested a night alone to watch Mike Trout play baseball. \n",
