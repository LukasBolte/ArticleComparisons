      " WASHINGTON (AP) \" Despite pushback from U.S. business, Mexico and Capitol Hill, President Donald Trump is doubling down on his threat to slap a 5% tariff on Mexican imports unless America's southern neighbor cracks down on Central American migrants trying to cross the U.S. border.\n",
      " U.S. manufacturers said the tariff, set to take effect June 10, would have devastating consequences on them and American consumers. U.S. stocks tumbled on Wall Street in response to Trump's planned action.\n",
      " \"Imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico is exactly the wrong move,\" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is exploring legal action in response to the tariffs. \" These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border. Instead, Congress and the president need to work together to address the serious problems at the border.\n",
      " Mexican President Andr �s Manuel López Obrador dispatched his foreign secretary to Washington to try to negotiate a solution. He said social problems are not solved with coercive measures, but also seemed convinced that Trump just needed to be informed about all the steps Mexico has taken to slow illegal migration.\n",
      " Mexico has stepped up raids on migrant caravans traveling through the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca this year. It has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more who wait endlessly for permits that would allow them to travel legally through Mexico.\n",
      " Administration officials told reporters in a briefing call Thursday evening that Mexico could prevent the tariffs from kicking in by securing its southern border with Guatemala, cracking down on criminal smuggling organizations, and entering into a \"safe third country agreement\" that would make it difficult for those who enter Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the U.S.\n",
      " \" We fully believe they have the ability to stop people coming in from their southern border and if they're able to do that, these tariffs will either not go into place or will be removed after they go into place,\" said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n",
      " Trump said the percentage will gradually increase \" up to 25% \" until the migration problem is remedied.\n",
      "Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades,\" Trump said in a tweet Friday. Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!\n",
      " Trump's decision showed the administration going to new lengths, and looking for new levers, to pressure Mexico to take action \" even if those risk upending other policy priorities, like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal that is the cornerstone of Trump's legislative agenda and seen as beneficial to his reelection effort.\n",
      " Keeping the economy rolling also is critical to Trump's reelection, and business was not happy with the president's planned tariff on Mexican imports.\n",
      "These proposed tariffs would have devastating consequences on manufacturers in America and on American consumers,\" said Jay Timmons, chief executive officer of the National Association of Manufacturers. We have taken our concerns to the highest levels of the administration and strongly urge them to consider carefully the impact of this action on working families across this country.\n",

      " Some of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress opposed the tariff.

      " After 32 straight wins, James Holzhauer is thiiis close to breaking the all-time Jeopardy! record for most money won, set back in 2004 by Ken Jennings. At the time, Jennings won 74 games straight and took home a prize of $2,520,700. Holzhauer, on the other hand, has won only half that number of games but has racked up $2,462,216. That leaves him $58,484 shy of Jennings record. \n",
      "<br>\n",
      " Not only that, Holzhauer also holds the record for most single-game earnings with $131,127. He's set to return to the game show on Monday, when he could break Jennings' record. \n",
      "<br>\n",
      " The show is just as impressed with Holzhauer's winning streak as we are, so much so that it made a comparison video (above), breaking down the play-by-play and numbers in comparison to Jennings' run. According to the video, Jennings had an accuracy response rate of 91%, while Holzhauer's is currently at 97%. \n",
      "<br>\n",
      " Jennings is perfectly fine, and clearly happy, to hand his winning streak over to a new champion, telling Good Morning America, \"For 15 years, I have thought somebody was going to make a run at this record, because I always knew it could be done. I was there. I saw it happen. What I did not expect was somebody could make a run at the cash record in, like, a third the time.\" \n",

      " \"[A surgeon] said, 'I'm going to have to amputate your leg' — I knew this would probably happen, it wasn't a complete shock, but it was one of those moments in your life you do remember and I said, 'Do I have a choice?'\" \n",

      "<br>\n",
      " It was not until April this year, that he shared his experiences and spoke with other amputees for the first time at a Limbs 4 Life gathering in Whyalla, about 80 kilometres away. \n",

      "<br>\n",
      " \"There is no doubt that component of their recovery is as equally as important as their physical recovery,\" Dr Braaf said \n",
      "<br>\n",
      " In the study she helped conduct, there were massive reductions in feelings of isolation when social support processes were in place. \n",
      "<br>\n",

      "<br>\n",
      " After connecting with Limbs 4 Life, Ms Villis was encouraged to share her story with other amputees. \n",
      "<br>\n",
      " \"It's been good for me to actually meet other people — I've even met somebody in a similar circumstance to myself now which is quite rare, because it's not a common amputation,\" she said. \n",

At the time, Jennings won 74 games straight and took home a prize of $2,520,700. Holzhauer, on the other hand, has won only half that number of games but has racked up $2,462,216. That leaves him $58,484 shy of Jennings record. ### Not only that, Holzhauer also holds the record for most single-game earnings with $131,127. He\\'s set to return to the game show on Monday, when he could break Jennings\\' record. ### The show is just as impressed with Holzhauer\\'s winning streak as we are, so much so that it made a comparison video (above), breaking down the play-by-play and numbers in comparison to Jennings\\' run. According to the video, Jennings had an accuracy response rate of 91%, while Holzhauer\\'s is currently at 97%. ### Jennings is perfectly fine, and clearly happy, to hand his winning streak over to a new champion, telling Good Morning America, \"For 15 years, I have thought somebody was going to make a run at this record, because I always knew it could be done. I was there. I saw it happen. What I did not expect was somebody could make a run at the cash record in, like, a third the time.\" ### Check your local listings for when Jeopardy! airs in your area. ### Other Links From TVGuide.com Jeopardy!Alex Trebek ### Never miss a story ### Choose the plan that\\'s right for you. ### Digital access or digital and print delivery.'"

However, throughout the summer and autumn the weather in the Caribbean is typically stickier and wetter than in the winter and spring months, though rain normally comes as short, heavy downpours rather than prolonged soggy periods.###Evasive actions###Cruise lines rely heavily on weather prediction and monitoring systems, and go to great lengths to re-route ships to avoid hurricanes. So even in the peak hurricane period, on a Caribbean cruise it is extremely unlikely you will come face to face with a big storm. A more likely scenario is your cruise being disrupted. For example, the itinerary may be changed at the last minute, so you end up missing ports or visiting different ones.\n",

      " To make matters worse, a series of strikes was initiated by the country's two main trade unions, Guinea Bissau's National Union of Workers and the General Confederation of Independent Trade Unions. They are demanding payment of salary arrears and a revaluation of the 100 000 FCFA minimum wage. Meeting these demands will be difficult. The country faces budgetary stress due largely to the low export price of cashew nuts in 2018, and the increase in public spending, including on the March elections.###In this precarious political and economic environment, organised crime networks continue to prosper with the complicity of certain government actors. On 9 March, while the country was in the middle of the electoral campaign, police made a record seizure of 789 kg of cocaine. On 30 April, 72 kg of cocaine from Guinea-Bissau were seized by Senegalese customs in the Tambacounda region in eastern Senegal.###Organised crime networks continue to prosper with the complicity of certain government actors###These seizures are a reminder that the country remains a major transit area for international drug trafficking, and that a lot more needs to be done about it. The capacity of the judicial police in Guinea-Bissau must be strengthened and cooperation with neighbouring countries boosted.\n",

      " My sweet William ( “Liam”) has arrived! It was a rough pregnancy for us. My husband developed PTSD after our miscarriage in April 2018 and he was terrified every step of the way with this little guy. Liam has been breech the whole pregnancy, confirmed by weekly ultrasounds for gestational diabetes. We had a scheduled c-section lined up, and when the big day arrived, my husband pretty much fell apart. He was vomiting uncontrollably and almost passing out even before it was time to go back to the OR. I went back alone and they told me they’d grab him right as they were bringing the baby out since flurries of activity seemed to set him off. Prep for the c-section sucked...they tried to place the spinal block at least 3 times and it was incredibly painful. Once it started working, I felt nauseous and threw up. I don’t know if they gave me any additional medication, but I started to feel super out of it. The whole experience felt surreal. I vaguely remember my husband appearing by my head and the medical team telling me my baby had arrived. I felt tugging sensations while they were taking him out and then as they were stitching me up, but no pain! It was the weirdest feeling. My baby didn’t cry when he was born, so I kept asking if he was okay. He’s just a super chill dude and I am so beyond in love. Overall, the scheduled c-section was a positive experience even though I was bummed about it at first.###Reply\n",

      " The political map of the country is changing. The gun lobby used to be bipartisan. John Dingell, the legendary union Democrat from Michigan, served on the NRA’s board until 1994. An avid hunter, he earned an A+ rating from the lobby for many years. He helped lead Congress the NRA’s way against gun-safety proposals after the massacres at Columbine and Virginia Tech. But as the Democratic Party has become more urban—and as the NRA has veered ever more unmistakably toward white nationalism—the gun movement ’s power has become tied ever more tightly to the Republican Party’s prospects. Those are seriously dimming. Democrats won more than 300 state legislative seats in 2018. They hold a majority of state attorney generalships. Republican-leaning women who used to accept NRA gun policy as part of the conservative coalition that held down their taxes have rebelled against the coalition in the age of Trump. Women are not only voting differently, but running for office in unprecedented numbers—and even fairly conservative women have zero use for the violent politics of the gun.###Hundreds of thousands of students have been through active-shooter drills—and their parents are angry about it. Only about one-third of U.S. parents now express confidence that their children are safe in school. The gun lobby may argue that the parents are overreacting, based on over-reading isolated incidents. That’s true, but it’s wonderfully ironic, since the case for guns is based on an even more radical misreading of data to mislead Americans into the false belief that guns in the house protect its dwellers.\n",

Since the early 1960s, five-year survival rates for many blood cancer patients have doubled, tripled or even quadrupled. In 1964, the five-year survival rate for children with the most commonly diagnosed leukemia was 3 percent. Today, it's approximately 90 percent. Nearly 1.2 million people in the U.S. are living with, or in remission from, a blood cancer.###Click here to learn more about the local chapter.###Follow The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Greater Bay Area Chapter on social media at:\n",

      " We identified a 14q21.2 microdeletion in a 16-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), IQ in the lower part of normal range but high-functioning memory skills. The deletion affects a gene desert, and the non-deleted gene closest to the microdeletion boundaries is LRFN5, which encodes a protein involved in synaptic plasticity and implicated in neuro-psychiatric disorders. LRFN5 expression was significantly decreased in the proband’s skin fibroblasts. The deleted region includes the pseudogene chr14.232.a, which is transcribed into a long non-coding RNA (lncLRFN5-10), whose levels were also significantly reduced in the proband’s fibroblasts compared to controls. Transfection of the patient’s fibroblasts with a plasmid expressing chr14.232.a significantly increased LRFN5 expression, while siRNA targeting chr14.232.a-derived lncLRFN5-10 reduced LRFN5 levels. In summary, we report on an individual with ASD carrying a microdeletion encompassing the pseudogene chr14.232.a encoding for lncLRFN5-10, which was found to affect the expression levels of the nearby, non-deleted LRFN5. This case illustrates the potential role of long non-coding RNAs in regulating expression of neighbouring genes with a functional role in ASD pathogenesis.\n",

There he makes his first contact with American—and black —musicians, one of whom gives him what’s presented as his first kiss from a man. He also delivers a crucial line that sets the tone for the rest of the film: “ You’ve got to kill the person you were born to be in order to become the person you want to be. ” It’s only there that, despite Fletcher’s sodden direction, the movie catches dramatic energy. Reggie drops into the office of a small record label and, taking the first name of Elton from a bandmate and the last name of John from Lennon, promotes himself as a songwriter.\n",

The Dam offers an excellent vantage point to look down the river into the pristine area between the Dam and the Indian Village. In the 1940s, two federal agencies, the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers, proposed plans to control flooding. In return, the dam would contribute to the generation of hydroelectric power and irrigate land in the basin. These plans merged into what became known as the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Plan. Construction of the Garrison Dam brought an influx of people from all areas. In July of 1946, the town site of Pick City was platted. The town was named for General Lewis A. Pick of the Corps of Engineers, who helped develop the Pick-Sloan plan. It was organized as a village in 1948. 4 Days of Pure Fun  MERCER COUNTY FAIR  Thursday July 11th - Sunday July 14th, 2019 Rocky Top Petting Zoo Kids Day...

Arif Magomedov, who debuted as a pro in 2013, was once one of Russia’s top prospects, with one-sided wins over 16-0 Alex Theran and Michael Zerafa and the first-round blowout of dangerous gatekeeper Darnell Boone.###Magomedov was up in the stars before being mercilessly brought down – firstly by little-known Andre Hernandez (11-4 at the time), and then being stopped by Luis Arias. Magomedov came back and presumably ended his career (at least for the time being), being schooled by 9-6 Georgian journeyman LashaGurguliani exactly a year ago.###Meanwhile, the very same Gurguliani, presumably a cannon fodder for bigger fighter, showed he was no fluke. Magomedov wasn’t his first victim, as he soundly outboxed 25-3 Nuhu Lawal just half a year before that. Then Gurguliani missed a year only to strike again. On Friday night, May 24, he became the world titleholder (of sorts) by beating Egyptian Greek Andread Valavanis (13-2, 11 KOs) on his home turf in Heliopolis, Egypt, with a unanimous decision over twelve rounds.

Unlike the lying, legacy media, you’re not afraid to take on the real bad guys and call them out for the dangerous charlatans they are. Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old autistic kid (and tool of green lobbyists ) who can literally see ‘carbon’ — or so she claims — and who has bewitched politicians and influencers across the world into imagining that yet more taxpayers’ money should be chucked at a non-existent problem. Sir David Attenborough, whispery-voiced gorilla-hugging Malthusian, slayer of walruses . The fact that they come across well on telly and appeal straight to people’s emotions is what makes them so dangerous. Global policy should not be based on muh feelings. Still less should it be based on “facts” which, on closer examination, turn out to be derived not from evidence or data but Ice Age 2. We owe it to the world’s children to tell them the truth about global warming — and related #fakenews scares like ‘ocean acidification’ and mass species extinction.

This time, too, El Niño seems to be disrupting the monsoon pattern of the country. Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal in East India, along with central parts of the country, predominantly Vidarbha, Marathwada, southern parts of Madhya Pradesh and some parts of Gujarat, are going to bear the maximum brunt of the El Niño phenomenon.###Currently, the probability of El Niño condition is still over 60% through summer 2019, which includes the monsoon months. We can expect a decline in El Niño, but chances would still remain as high as 50% during the winter months.###The months of March, April and May have been fairly warm and with SST (Sea Surface Temperature) maintaining its threshold value, El Niño conditions continue to prevail, though on a devolving note. This clearly indicates a below normal monsoon rain in the country this year.###According to records, in the past 28 years from 1991 to 2018, El Niño was present in 10 years (1991, 1994, 1997, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2014, 2015 & 2018) during the Southwest monsoon. Two (1991 & 2018) out of the 10 El Niño years witnessed below normal or deficient rainfall while five years (2002, 2004, 2009, 2014 & 2015) witnessed drought.\n",

He eventually dumped them in rural Alabama.###There are differing complex standards for each jury finding. If the jury finds “guilty,” that means it believes Jones knew the killings were wrong from a moral and legal standpoint. A finding of “not guilty by reason of insanity” means the jury believes Jones was living in a completely delusional world and didn’t know what he was doing was wrong, from either a legal or moral standpoint A finding of “guilty but mentally ill” means the jury found Jones’s judgment was impaired by mental illness but he knew right from wrong.\n",

It's the nightmare scenario that gun-control advocates have warned about amid efforts in recent years to ease restrictions on the devices, which they say can help shooters escape detection and inflict more carnage.###But gun-rights advocates and most law enforcement experts say DeWayne Craddock's use of a suppressor likely had no bearing on his ability to kill so many people in so little time Friday.###Virginia is among 42 states that allow residents to purchase and possess suppressors, though some cities and towns — including Virginia Beach — prohibit them.###Known colloquially as a \"silencer,\" a suppressor was attached to the .45-caliber handgun that police say Craddock used to kill a dozen people on three floors of the city building where he worked before police closed in and, after a protracted gunbattle, fatally shot him.\n",
