From 1942 to 1945 more than 2 million American military personnel were stationed in the U.K., and across the country people still commemorate their sacrifice. Britain is dotted with memorials, many built and still tended by local people who honor those who died and remember the thousands of others they drank and danced and fought with. Matt Dunham AP Photo ### TOPCROFT, England ### David Woodrow, 95, raises the American flag beside a memorial on his farm in eastern England every morning, weather permitting. ### He makes sure that memorial is tip-top, too. Dedicated to the U.S. Army Air Force's 93rd Bombardment Group (Heavy), it is surrounded by irises and geraniums Woodrow planted himself. The grass is trimmed to the millimeter. The granite gleams. ### ""There's one thing for certain: If Americans hadn't come over here and went to Normandy with us in '44 and the Germans had pushed us back into the sea, we couldn't have gone back again for another two or three years,"" Woodrow, a D-Day veteran himself, said when asked why he put it there. ""By that time, Germany would have had the bomb first and they would have won the war. They would have won the war then — if Normandy had failed."" ### As the wartime allies prepare to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, people around Britain are also remembering the Americans who paved the way for the invasion, including sailors who helped keep supplies flowing across the North Atlantic and air crews that flew bombing missions over occupied Europe. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to Centre Daily Times content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### From 1942 to 1945, more than 2 million U.S. military personnel were stationed in Britain. People across the country still commemorate that friendly invasion, which bolstered the nation's defenses and gave many their first taste of America. From Portpatrick on the west coast of Scotland, where a plaque marks the site of a plane crash that killed 22 American airmen, to the Norfolk farm where Woodrow raises Old Glory, Britain is dotted with memorials to U.S. servicemen. ### Some are formal affairs funded by public money, like the Cambridge American Cemetery, which houses the remains of 3,811 war dead, and the American Air Museum a few miles away, where the silhouettes of 7,031 lost aircraft are etched into a curving wall of glass. ### But most are impromptu shrines built and tended by local people to honor those who died and to remember the thousands of others they drank and danced and fought with. ### There was no government master plan to make this happen. The memorials just sprang up organically, particularly in southeastern England, where most of the U.S. air bases were located because of the proximity to occupied Europe. ### Volunteers look after memorials in village squares, on corners of former airfields, at crash sites. Museums have been placed in former control towers. World War II memorabilia collections are preserved in pubs. ### One of these personal monuments made headlines earlier this year, when 82-year-old Tony Foulds persuaded the U.S. Air Force to stage a fly-past to honor 10 American airmen who died in a crash in the northern city of Sheffield in 1944. Foulds, who believes the pilot saved his life by steering away from a field where he was playing with other children, has tended a memorial to the airmen since 1969. ### Thousands rose at dawn in February to gaze at the fly-past. ### No surprise there, said Briton Mike Warner, who serves as informal liaison between the U.S. Air Force and local communities. ### ""These individuals fought alongside our own forces,"" he said. ### One place that decided to pay tribute is Redlingfield, a village 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of London, which built a black granite memorial to 2nd Lt. Kenneth Rongstad and the crew of a B-17 bomber that crashed into a farmhouse on Nov. 19, 1943. ### Janet Norman-Philips, 66, and other locals make sure it is scrubbed and bordered with bright pansies. ### ""People wanted to remember them,"" said Norman-Philips, who worked with American veterans to erect the monument. ""They were adopted, almost."" ### There's a reason the Americans made such an impression. Tiny rural communities, some with no running water, electricity or indoor plumbing, woke up to find construction crews pouring concrete on the flat farmland within striking distance of occupied Europe. Little Redlingfield soon had 3,000 servicemen from the Eighth Air Force as neighbors. ### The Americans brought not just bombers but stuff the locals couldn't get their hands on after years of war, like clothing, tinned fruit and candy. Local girls danced to swing music with American servicemen and the bases held Christmas parties for local children. ### It wasn't all songs and roses, though. The British were shocked by segregation in the U.S. military, and American manners — or the lack of them — sometimes clashed with the more traditional local culture. ### But once they got over the shock, the Brits and the Americans generally got along. ### James Clarey became fascinated with the story of the Americans in England as a teenager, when he found an airman's ID bracelet at a crash site near his home. He began collecting artifacts and eventually set up the 453rd Bomb Group Museum and 8th Air Force Heritage Gallery at the Old Buckenham Airfield. ### It's the sort of place where a pilot can still land a small plane, park it on the grass and sit on picnic tables out front of the cafe. Actor Jimmy Stewart was stationed here during the war, as was Walter Matthau. ### Here, surrounded by memorabilia and personal stories, one is reminded of the sheer poignancy of this D-Day, because the people who were there, the living links to a horrific conflict, are slipping away. ### ""This is kind of the twilight years for them,"" Clarey said. ""You must remember what these people did 75 years ago."" ### Woodrow, who served in the Royal Air Force during the war, landed at Normandy to scout out locations for landing zones in northern France. Soon after leaving the RAF in the early 1950s, he bought the Hardwick Airfield and built his farm on it. The sergeant's mess now houses his pigs and other wartime buildings hold a greenhouse and community hall. ### Veterans of the 93rd started trickling past in the 1960s, anxious to revisit the place they had served. By the 1970s, the flow of unannounced visitors had become a steady stream, but Woodrow always invited them in. ### When the memorial was dedicated in 1987, some 500 people came from the United States. There was, of course, a big party afterward. ### One of Woodrow's proudest possessions is a plaque that the bombers' group gave him in 1995 ""in gratitude"" to him and his wife, Jean, for providing the staging post for men who wanted to remember. ### Fewer veterans visit the memorial these days. There aren't many left. But their children do, and their grandchildren as well. ### Woodrow and his family still do what they have always done for the Americans: They open the door and say ""Welcome!""",060119,1,""" This is kind of the twilight years for them,"" Clarey said. "" You must remember what these people did 75 years ago.

But he said that would be possible only if the Census asked every household about its members' immigration status for the first time since 1950. ### The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on that question as early as next month. But Republicans who support adding the citizenship question have rarely acknowledged any partisan political motive. The emergence of the documents now could figure heavily in the case the court is considering. ### To civil liberties lawyers suing to block the question, it's now clear that partisan politics were at work all along. They assert in court filings that Hofeller not only laid out the political benefit for the GOP but also ghost-wrote a U.S. Department of Justice letter calling on the Census Bureau to add an immigration question to next year's survey. ### The Justice Department denied the allegations in a statement on Thursday, saying Hofeller's Texas analysis ""played no role in the Department's December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census."" In that 2017 letter, Justice said it needed citizenship information to protect the voting rights of minorities. ### The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the citizenship question in April and is expected to rule by July whether it will be allowed. ### ""What it would result in is outrageously overpopulated and underpopulated districts,"" said Matt Angle, a Democratic redistricting strategist, adding that the resulting maps would harm Texas' booming Hispanic population with the aim of benefiting Republicans. ### Many of the state's top Republicans, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , have publicly expressed support for a citizenship question on the Census. On Friday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's office did not respond to questions about whether he would endorse using citizenship data to draw new maps, although a spokeswoman said last year that the Census question would provide greater transparency and was dismissive of fears of under-reporting. ### Opponents contend that many noncitizens and their relatives will shy away from being counted, fearing that law enforcement will be told of individuals' citizenship status. That could cause undercounts in places with large Latino populations, including parts of Texas, California, Florida and Arizona, and could cost them seats in Congress as well as federal funding. ### But the political impact of the citizenship question could go beyond an undercount if states use citizenship information to draw the maps for state legislative districts. The concept was introduced in legislation over the last few years in Missouri and Nebraska, where the state constitution already calls for excluding ""aliens"" from its apportionment. And Alabama has sued the federal government saying it should supply citizenship information. ### In Texas, Hofeller calculated in his report that about a half-dozen Latino-dominated districts would disappear, including a portion of one in the Dallas area, up to two in Houston's Harris County and two or three in the border counties of South Texas. ""A switch to the use of citizen voting age population as the redistricting population base for redistricting would be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,"" he wrote. ### There's a question of whether the switch would be legal. ### The U.S. Constitution specifies that congressional districts should be based on how many people — not citizens — live there. But it's murkier for many state legislative districts. ### The case at the heart of Hofeller's 2015 report was brought by Texas voters who contended it was unfair that noncitizens and minors were counted in making legislative districts because it gave a bigger voice to a smaller number of eligible voters in places with a lot of noncitizens and children. In response, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that states could not be forced to use voting-age citizens as the basis for districting. ### Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with that decision but wrote a separate opinion that seems to invite states to do it on their own. ""It instead leaves states significant leeway in apportioning their own districts to equalize total population, to equalize eligible voters, or to promote any other principle consistent with a republican form of government,"" Thomas wrote. ### If a state tried to use a limited population count for redistricting, a lawsuit would be likely. ### ""They're always trying to argue that only citizens should be counted for drawing the lines. They think it's to their advantage,"" said Luis Vera, a San Antonio-based lawyer for the League of United Latin American Citizens who has spent decades in court with the state over redistricting battles and said he'd sue if Texas switched to citizen-based districts. ### Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said lawmakers may be reluctant to change which count is used for redistricting knowing they'd face legal challenges. ### He said that even if a switch could be approved under a state constitution, it could run afoul of the federal Voting Rights Act, which bars state and local governments from restricting equal voting access based on race. ### But Rogelio Sáenz, a sociologist at the University of Texas-San Antonio, said he expects it will be considered in Texas, where Democrats picked up 12 seats in the House last year, now giving them 67 of the 150. ### ""The Republican Party is really anxious to gain back those few seats they lost in the last election,"" Sáenz said. ### ———",060119,1,"To civil liberties lawyers suing to block the question, it's now clear that partisan politics were at work all along.

Lilienthal, 40, of Longview has been in the Lewis County Jail since his arrest on April 19 pending resolution of charges of possession of methamphetamine. ### According to Washington State Patrol incident reports obtained by The Centralia Chronicle through a public records request, at about 6 a.m. April 19, a trooper on patrol in Lewis County clocked a northbound 1993 Honda Accord traveling 18 mph over the speed limit on Interstate 5. ### The vehicle’s tabs were expired, and the Honda was traveling erratically — as though the driver were “attempting to hide something” — as it pulled over onto the shoulder after the trooper activated his lights and sirens, according to the report. ### The vehicle continued for another mile before getting off at exit 68, according to reports. ### Lilienthal, the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle, had a suspended license and said he bought the vehicle about five to six days earlier. ### A property/evidence report from WSP listed the owner of the vehicle as Brian D. Butts, a Kalama resident whom police have accused of shooting DeRosier and who himself died in a shootout with two Kelso officers the next day. ### “Washington State Patrol communications also advised me that the vehicle was linked to the Deputy involved shooting in Cowlitz County on Saturday April 13th 2019,” the trooper wrote in the report. ### Another responding trooper wrote: “(A WSP sergeant) … was in contact with detectives that were investigating the murder and they requested that we search the vehicle for a .40 caliber magazine that was an item of interest in the investigation.” ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### Lilienthal, who had been promptly arrested for driving on a suspended license, consented to a search of the vehicle. ### “On the driver’s floorboard of the vehicle I located 2 large white crystals that I believed to be methamphetamine. Then I located another crystal under the driver’s seat along with a glass meth pipe that was wrapped in a small towel. No other contraband was located,” reads the report. ### One of the troopers noted a spilled smoothie in the car, and expressed belief that Lilienthal — who allegedly said to the trooper that he used to use meth — was trying to hide the meth crystals in the smoothie before being pulled over. ### Lilienthal, during a preliminary hearing in Lewis County Superior Court on April 22, said he had worked with Butts. ### “I didn’t know that Brian Butts was the kind of person that he is. I only worked with him. I didn’t know he shot an officer. I didn’t know that he was living that kind of life. I just bought the car from him,” Lilienthal said to Judge R.W. Buzzard during the hearing. ### He insisted he didn’t know there were drugs in the car, adding that despite his criminal history and multiple warrants for failure to appear he has been staying out of trouble. ### “I know that I have a record that goes a ways back, but I’m not trying to live that life. I have a 16-month-old daughter that I’m trying to live right for. I didn’t know the things that were in that car,” he said. ### He was granted $20,000 bail on the drug charge and $5,000 bail for the suspended license charge, but is still in custody. ### On May 17, he pleaded guilty, and a sentencing hearing is set for June 12. ### Subscribe to Daily Headlines ### Sign up!  ### Love",060119,1,"“ I didn’t know that Brian Butts was the kind of person that he is.

6447,"Southwest monsoon: Don’t bet your farm on it ### Southwest monsoon: Don’t bet your farm on it ### Southwest monsoon: Don’t bet your farm on it ### X Share via ### Jun 01 2019, 22:28pm ist ### updated: Jun 01 2019, 22:40pm ist ### The Southwest monsoon is the most anticipated season in India due to the impact it has on agriculture in the country, with its direct and indirect effects on not just the country’s farmers but also the macroeconomy. Agriculture in India is largely rain-fed, and a poor monsoon or drought can have a huge bearing on farmers and the farm-dependent economy of the country. Alarmingly, Skymet has forecast the Southwest monsoon 2019 to be below normal at 93% of the LPA (Long Period Average of June, July, August and September (JJAS) -- 887 mm) with an error margin of +/-5%. ### If we look at the spatial distribution, rainfall in East and Northeast India -- the rainiest pocket in the country during the Southwest Monsoon -- is 92% of the LPA, while in Central India, which stands second in terms of monsoon rain, the probability of rainfall is 91%. In the other two pockets of Northwest India and the Southern Peninsula, the prospect of rain is 91% and 95%, respectively. ### On the probabilities of normal, below normal, drought or excess rain, the following figures are the assessment of Skymet. ### Monsoon 2019 probabilities for JJAS are: ### 0% chance of excess (seasonal rainfall that is more than 110% of LPA) ### 0% chance of above normal (seasonal rainfall that is between 105 to 110% of LPA) ### 30% chance of normal (seasonal rainfall that is between 96 to 104% of LPA) ### 55% chance of below normal (seasonal rainfall that is between 90 to 95% of LPA) ### 15% chance of drought (seasonal rainfall that is less than 90% of LPA) ###  ### El Niño, which is the unusual warming of the Eastern Pacific Ocean, has been impacting monsoon rains in India more often than normal in the recent past. This time, too, El Niño seems to be disrupting the monsoon pattern of the country. Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal in East India, along with central parts of the country, predominantly Vidarbha, Marathwada, southern parts of Madhya Pradesh and some parts of Gujarat, are going to bear the maximum brunt of the El Niño phenomenon. ### Currently, the probability of El Niño condition is still over 60% through summer 2019, which includes the monsoon months. We can expect a decline in El Niño, but chances would still remain as high as 50% during the winter months. ### The months of March, April and May have been fairly warm and with SST (Sea Surface Temperature) maintaining its threshold value, El Niño conditions continue to prevail, though on a devolving note. This clearly indicates a below normal monsoon rain in the country this year. ### According to records, in the past 28 years from 1991 to 2018, El Niño was present in 10 years (1991, 1994, 1997, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2014, 2015 & 2018) during the Southwest monsoon. Two (1991 & 2018) out of the 10 El Niño years witnessed below normal or deficient rainfall while five years (2002, 2004, 2009, 2014 & 2015) witnessed drought. ### Out of the 10 El Niño years, food grain production declined in seven years, with 2002 witnessing the steepest decline of 22%. Pulses (Kharif + Rabi) saw a decrease in production in six years out of 10, with a reduction of 16.7% in 2002. Soybean saw a decrease in production in five years out of 10, with a reduction of 22% in 2002. Rice saw a decrease in production in five years out of 10, with a reduction of 23% in 2002. Scanty rainfall this monsoon season will perhaps put the country in a similar situation. ### About half of the food grain production in India comes from the Kharif output, which stands at around 140 million tons. The quantum and distribution of monsoon have a direct bearing on the sowing operations of Kharif and subsequent crops over many regions of the country. ### According to an analysis carried out by Skymet, paddy production is likely to go down in the upcoming Kharif season (2019-2020) to 97.78 million tons, which is a fall of about 4% compared to the 101.96 million tons produced last year. The area under paddy cultivation would remain the same. However, the vagaries of monsoon are expected to affect the yield primarily in the rain-fed areas. West Bengal, the largest paddy producing state in the country, is at the maximum risk of receiving poor monsoon rain. ### However, soybean production is likely to increase by around 0.14% to 13.71 million tons, compared to 13.69 million tons the previous season. The area under soybean cultivation is likely to go up by 3.2%, but the increase in production will be marginal due to the forecast of below-normal rain. ### Cotton production in the country is also expected to increase by 15.5% to 34.74 million bales in 2019-20, compared to 30.08 million bales last year. Cotton acreage on a national basis is likely to be higher by 2.7% to 12.57 million hectares. This is some good news for the cotton farmers staring at a gloomy monsoon season. ### Agriculture contributes about 16% of India’s GDP. Therefore, a good monsoon is imperative for a bumper farm output, which helps in keeping food prices and inflation under check. High agricultural production also pushes up the incomes of rural people, which in turn boosts demand for consumer goods. Government spending also declines in a good monsoon year. ### But with monsoon 2019 forecast at 93% of the LPA, the scenario does not look too good. ### (The writer is founder and managing director, Skymet Weather Services)",060119,1,"El Niño, which is the unusual warming of the Eastern Pacific Ocean, has been impacting monsoon rains in India more often than normal in the recent past.

We can expect a decline in El Niño, but chances would still remain as high as 50% during the winter months.</p><p>The months of March, April and May have been fairly warm and with SST (Sea Surface Temperature) maintaining its threshold value, El Niño conditions continue to prevail, though on a devolving note. This clearly indicates a below normal monsoon rain in the country this year.</p><p>According to records, in the past 28 years from 1991 to 2018, El Niño was present in 10 years (1991, 1994, 1997, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2014, 2015 & 2018) during the Southwest monsoon. Two (1991 & 2018) out of the 10 El Niño years witnessed below normal or deficient rainfall while five years (2002, 2004, 2009, 2014 & 2015) witnessed drought.</p>"

But the mistake may be more common than you think, according to researchers who claimed surgeons don't always confess to their errors ### Studies have estimated one wrong side surgery per 100,000 procedures – but the academics suggested the rate may be closer to one in every 16,000. ### Dr Daniel Arnal, from the Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón, Madrid, Spain, led the research analysing incidents between 2007 and 2018. ### He said: 'The stark reality is due to the lack of reporting to incident databases, these figures most likely represent an underestimate of the true situation. ### RELATED ARTICLES ### Share this article ### Share ### 'However, the reporting of wrong side errors have led to substantial corrective measures to prevent their repetition in our hospitals.' ### Almost half of the incidents (48 per cent) occurred in orthopaedic surgery, operations on bones, joints, ligaments and muscles. ### Ophthalmology surgery – operations on the eye – was responsible for 28 per cent of all of the recorded wrong site errors. ### WHAT IS A NEVER EVENT? ### Never events represent a fraction of the 4.6 million surgical procedures carried out each year and only occur in one in 20,000 cases of surgery. ### They include operating on the wrong body parts, mixing up organs and leaving surgical tools inside patients. ### Such incident have even led to deaths, including that of Frank Hibbard, who had undergone cancer surgery in October 2001 at Luton and Dunstable Hospital. ### Bungling medics left an 8cm-long piece of gauze inside his pelvis, which triggered a soft tissue cancer and led to the lorry driver's death, aged just 69. ### In 2015, Britain was called out for being one of the worst offenders for leaving items inside patients by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. ### Most of the errors (45) involved anaesthetic being given on the wrong side of the body. Severe harm was caused on three occasions. ### The remaining 36 revolved around the surgical procedure itself, according to the study presented at the Euroanaesthesia Congress in Vienna. ### An analysis of how the mistakes happened revealed patients were to blame for around 20 per cent, and incorrect site marking responsible for 16 per cent. ### Surgeons were distracted in eight per cent of the cases, and rushing was to blame for around 17 per cent of the errors. ### The remaining were caused by medics not having a surgical safety checklist, or not using it correctly. ### Dr Arnal added: 'Our findings highlight the need for adequate training and appropriate use of surgical check-lists. ### 'While these serious wrong side events are extremely rare, our mission should be to drive them down to zero.' ### A never event is defined as a catastrophic hospital blunders deemed so serious that it should never take place, such as operating on the wrong body parts. ### To avoid such a blunder, health officials advocate the use of standardised patient wristbands and the World Health Organization's Surgical Safety Checklist. ### The WHO measure, introduced a decade ago, was launched as a tool to improve the safety of surgery and prevent unnecessary deaths. ### It helps medics ensure they don't operate on the wrong patient, perform the wrong procedure or operate on the wrong part of their body. ### The data was taken from incidents reported to SENSAR, the Spanish Safety Reporting System in Anaesthesia and Resuscitation. ### The database covers 100 predominantly large hospitals across Spain, including one sin the Canary Islands, Madrid and Barcelona.",060119,1,"Ophthalmology surgery – operations on the eye – was responsible for 28 per cent of all of the recorded wrong site errors.###WHAT IS A NEVER EVENT?###Never events represent a fraction of the 4.6 million surgical procedures carried out each year and only occur in one in 20,000 cases of surgery.###They include operating on the wrong body parts, mixing up organs and leaving surgical tools inside patients.###Such incident have even led to deaths, including that of Frank Hibbard, who had undergone cancer surgery in October 2001 at Luton and Dunstable Hospital.###Bungling medics left an 8cm-long piece of gauze inside his pelvis, which triggered a soft tissue cancer and led to the lorry driver's death, aged just 69.","[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]","<p>Ophthalmology surgery – operations on the eye – was responsible for 28 per cent of all of the recorded wrong site errors.</p><p>WHAT IS A NEVER EVENT?</p><p>Never events represent a fraction of the 4.6 million surgical procedures carried out each year and only occur in one in 20,000 cases of surgery.</p><p>They include operating on the wrong body parts, mixing up organs and leaving surgical tools inside patients.</p><p>Such incident have even led to deaths, including that of Frank Hibbard, who had undergone cancer surgery in October 2001 at Luton and Dunstable Hospital.</p><p>Bungling medics left an 8cm-long piece of gauze inside his pelvis, which triggered a soft tissue cancer and led to the lorry driver's death, aged just 69.</p>"

38427,"A look at what passed and failed in the Alabama Legislature ### Follow Us ### Was Mueller nudging Congress to impeach Trump ### Question of the Day ### Print ### By -         Associated Press  -                                                                         Friday, May 31, 2019 ### MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama lawmakers ended the 2019 legislative session on Friday. Here’s a look at some of the proposals that passed and failed this year. ### WHAT WAS APPROVED: ### ___ ### GAS TAX ### Gov. Kay Ivey called lawmakers into special session to approve the gas tax increase to fund road and bridge construction. The 10-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase will be phased in over three years beginning with a six-cent increase on Sept. 1 ### ___ ### ABORTION BAN ### The ban makes it a felony to perform an abortion unless the mother’s life is in danger. It is anticipated that it will be blocked by the courts. A lawsuit has been filed challenging the ban. ### ___ ### THIRD GRADE READING ### The legislation will require third graders to meet reading benchmarks before moving to fourth grade. The bill also spells out initiatives, such as requiring regional reading specialists to work with struggling students, to boost test scores. ### __ ### STATE SCHOOL BOARD ### Alabama voters will decide next year whether they want to abolish the elected state school board and replace it with a nine-member commission. Members would be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Alabama Senate. ### ___ ### PAY RAISES FOR TEACHERS, OTHERS ### Teachers and other public school employees will receive a 4% pay raise. State employees will receive a 2% raise. Lawmakers also voted to raise the pay for correctional officers as the state faces a federal court order to add officers. ### ___ ### PAROLE BOARD OVERHAUL ### The bill makes multiple changes at the state parole board, including making a gubernatorial appointee who could be dismissed at will by the governor. The board currently hires the director. ### ___ ### EQUAL PAY ### The legislation prohibits businesses from paying workers less than employees of another race or sex for the same work unless there are reasons such as seniority, a merit system or productivity to account for the difference. ### ___ ### JAIL FOOD ### Alabama lawmakers voted to end a practice that allowed some sheriffs to pocket leftover jail food funds. The bill requires the food allowance to go into a separate account that can only be used for feeding prisoners. ### ___ ### CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE ### The measures would track how often prosecutors use civil actions to seize a person’s property for suspected criminal activity. State prosecutors agreed this year to track the forfeitures, but the legislation would mandate it. ### ___ ### MEDICAL MARIJUANA STUDY COMMISSION ### Lawmakers voted to create a medical marijuana commission that would make recommendations for legislation that lawmakers might consider in 2020. ### ___ ### BROADBAND ACCESS ### The governor signed into law two bills aimed at expanding broadband access. One bill expands an existing grant program for broadband providers in rural communities. Another allows electricity providers to use existing infrastructure to provide broadband services. ### ___ ### MARRIAGE LICENSES ### Marriage licenses would be replaced with a new form called a marriage certificate. The change comes after several probate judges stopped issuing marriage licenses so they don’t have to give them to gay couples. Judges wouldn’t have to sign the new forms before a wedding. ### ___ ### BACKSEAT SEATBELTS ### The measure would require a person to wear a seat belt in the backseat of a moving vehicle. The legislation is named for a Montgomery teen killed in a car crash. ### ___ ### ___ ### LOTTERY ### A proposal to start a state lottery cleared the Alabama Senate, but it did not get a vote in the House. ### ___ ### PERMITLESS CARRY ### A bill to allow a person to carry a concealed handgun without getting a special permit failed to win approval in a Senate committee. The bill was backed by gun rights groups but opposed by state sheriffs. ### ___ ### MARIJUANA DECRIMINALIZATION ### The bill would have made possession of small amounts of marijuana punishable by a fine instead of jail time. An Alabama Senate committee advanced the bill, but it did not get final approval. ### ___ ### MEDICAL MARIJUANA ### The Senate approved a bill that would allow people with certain medical conditions to purchase medical marijuana with a doctor’s approval. However, the measure stalled in the House. ### ___ ### PAYDAY LOAN ### The proposal would extend the time that people have to repay a payday loan to 30 days. The proposal was designed to give borrowers more opportunity to raise the funds needed to repay a loan. ### ___ ### MANDATORY KINDERGARTEN ### The proposal would have required student to attend kindergarten before starting first grade. Most students do attend kindergarten, but it is not mandatory. ### ___ ### ETHICS OVERHAUL ### A Senate committee shelved a proposal that would have done away with a ban on gifts to public officials but replaced it with a requirement to report everything that was given. ### ___",060119,1,"_ __###PAY RAISES FOR TEACHERS, OTHERS###Teachers and other public school employees will receive a 4% pay raise.

Previously, registration closed 28 days before an election. ### Morgan Lee ### Partisan control determines how states act on voting rights ### By CHRISTINA A. CASSIDY Associated Press ### Jun 1, 2019 ### Save ### ATLANTA (AP) — New York voters for years have experienced some of the longest wait times in the nation on Election Day. Attempts to fix the problem routinely became casualties of the divided politics of the state Legislature. ### That dynamic changed last November, when Democrats won majorities in both legislative chambers, and it didn't take them long to act. ### Just weeks into this year's legislative session, they passed a bill to allow early voting, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo promptly signed it. ### ""Early voting is going to make a significant difference for countless numbers of New Yorkers by making polling places so much more accessible and allow voters to determine when it is most convenient for them,"" said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York. ### New York is among a small number of states where Democrats made big gains in last year's election and have used that power to pass laws to make it easier to register and to vote. They have introduced early voting, all-mail voting or automatic registration. ### A few Republican-led states — some of which saw high turnout for Democratic candidates — are going in the opposite direction, advancing bills to tighten voter registration and early voting. ### ""Some of this seems like a fairly direct response to things that happened in the midterms,"" said Max Feldman, who tracks voting laws at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law. ### In New Mexico, Democrats not only expanded their majority in the state House but also claimed the governor's mansion after eight years of GOP control. By March, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had signed a law to allow people to register and vote on the same day beginning in 2021. Previously, registration ended 28 days before an election. ### Hawaii lawmakers approved legislation replacing the in-person voting system with one made up entirely of mailed ballots. If the measure is signed into law, the state will join Colorado, Oregon and Washington with mail-only voting. Delaware approved in-person, early voting beginning in 2022. ### While bills increasing voter access this year far outnumbered those seeking to impose restrictions, many of the expansion bills were put forward by Democratic lawmakers in states led by Republicans. That means they are unlikely pass. ### In the 2018 elections, Democrats nearly doubled to 14 the number of states in which they control the governor's office and both legislative chambers, but Republicans remain in charge in more states — 22. ### While some voting reforms such as automatic registration have drawn bipartisan support, Republicans generally have opposed same-day registration, mail-only voting and other changes, saying they increase the potential for fraud. ### In Connecticut, Republicans recently thwarted a push by Democrats to do as New York did and add in-person, early voting. Democrats have a legislative majority there, but a constitutional amendment is required to make the change, and they fell short of garnering the votes necessary to put the issue on the ballot. ### Republicans had expressed concern that early voters might come to regret their selections if a race's dynamics shifted after they had turned in their ballot. ### GOP lawmakers in some states also have targeted groups that register voters. They say such groups can create a burden for local election officials if they turn in large numbers of forms that are incomplete or contain false information. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### In Tennessee, Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed a law that allows for fines against groups turning in 100 or more incomplete registration forms in a year. ### ""This bill was presented because of actual circumstances that were meant to confuse the integrity, or to create a lack of integrity, in the voting process,"" Lee said. ### Critics say Tennessee's Republicans feel threatened by an increase in voter participation last year. In 2018, turnout in the state was 51 percent higher than in the previous midterm election. About 259,500 new voters registered in the six months before Election Day. ### ""What politicians should be doing is making sure that local election officials have the adequate resources to do their jobs,"" ACLU attorney Sophia Lakin said in announcing a federal lawsuit challenging the new law. ""Silencing civic groups' voices is not the solution."" ### In Texas, where Democrats picked up two congressional seats last year, lawmakers have been considering a bill that would make it a felony rather than a misdemeanor to knowingly put false information on a voter registration form. It would also increase scrutiny of those who provide transportation for voters headed to the polls. ### The legislation passed the state Senate but stalled in the House. ### Voter-suppression claims also have been made against Republicans in Florida, over a constitutional amendment voters approved last year that would make it easier for convicted felons to regain the right to vote. ### Republican lawmakers, in drafting legislation to implement the amendment, said its language about felons having to complete ""all terms of their sentence including parole or probation"" also meant paying all court fees, fines and restitution before being eligible to vote. ### ""This measure is nothing but a poll tax that would effectively disenfranchise those who are unable to pay,"" Rep. Marcia L. Fudge, an Ohio Democrat, said during a recent congressional hearing in Florida. ### The bill's sponsor, GOP state Sen. Jeff Brandes, defended it, saying: ""Our goal was to follow the constitution, and the constitution is clear — 'all terms of the sentence.'"" ### ———",060119,1,"FILE - In this Thursday, Jan. 31, 2019, file photo, U.S. Rep.

At the top of the list you will typically find more storage, better lighting, updated finishes, etc. However, when a homeowner has Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS), the priorities change with indoor air quality and chemical-free maintenance hitting the top of the list. ### Asthma sufferers or people with severe chemical sensitivities often design and build their own houses with some of these specifications in mind. ### Proper ventilated fan ### Properly installed title to avoid mold ### Quality indoor air ### Remodelers, designers and builders have an ethical obligation to educate homeowners on their options for incorporating low/non-toxic materials that will render any project safe and healthy for its occupants. ### Here are some primary selection criteria for consideration: ### Natural hard surface flooring such as cork, linoleum, wood or tile instead of carpeting, laminate or vinyl to minimize off-gassing and the harboring of dust mites, mildew and/or bacteria. ### Low/No VOC paints and finishes over their high VOC brethren — look for third party certifications such as Green Seal ( www.greenseal.org ) or Green Guard ( www.greenguard.org ) for assurance of low VOC levels. ### Vintage furniture has likely already off-gassed its toxic components so consider buying used. If new furnishings are what you need, look for a manufacturer’s membership in the Sustainable Furnishings Council ( www.sustainablefurnishings.org ) which promotes the manufacturing of sustainable, low toxicity products. ### Stock or semi-custom cabinetry that has earned the Environmental Stewardship Program seal from the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association (KCMA - www.greencabinetsource.org ). ### Custom made cabinetry and furniture that uses only no added formaldehyde plywood, particle board and/or medium density fiber board (MDF) along with low VOC finishes and adhesives. ### Countertop materials that don’t contain high VOC glues, resins or other toxic binding agents and can be maintained without the use of high VOC sealants and cleaning agents. ### Look for untreated natural fibers such as wool, cotton, jute, etc. rather than synthetic fiber materials for window coverings and furnishings. ### Other considerations would include using materials that do not require toxic cleaning agents for routine maintenance and installing prefinished millwork. It is also recommended to analyze and supplement, where necessary, the home’s ventilation including upgrading kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans, installing a filter on a forced air furnace and/or installing a room air exchanger. ### Working with professionals who are well versed in the area of environmental design and construction, is one way to ensure that selected materials and finishes meet the needs of those with chemical sensitivities.

Kamala Harris' microphone during a Democratic presidential candidates forum in San Francisco on Saturday before being escorted from the stage. ### The California senator was discussing implementing her gender pay-gap plan at the MoveOn ""Big Ideas Forum"" when the protester ran onto the stage, took the microphone from her hand and began speaking to the crowd. Harris, meanwhile, quickly walked off the stage. ### Story Continued Below ### ""We're asking for a much bigger idea than..."" the protester said before his microphone was cut off and he was surrounded by event security then dragged from the stage. ### The protester, Aidan Cook, of the Direct Action Everywhere animal-rights group, was asking for Harris to ""support ordinary citizens rescuing animals rather than the factory farms that abuse animals, sicken local populations and repress whistleblowing activity,"" according to a press release by DAE. ### ""I live in Oakland and I'm one of Kamala Harris' constituents. I came to the MoveOn Big Ideas Forum today because there's one big idea that all of the 2020 presidential candidates are ignoring. Which is that is by raising and slaughtering billions of animals every year not only are we completely ... undermining our values as a nation of compassionate animal lovers but we are literally preparing to drive our society off a cliff.

49407,"Fred Mawer ### It's possible to take a Caribbean cruise any time of the year. That includes during the Atlantic hurricane season, which officially runs from June 1 to November 30. You might think it's best to cruise in another part of the world during those months. But it's not as clear-cut as that, and there are in fact some compelling reasons to cruise around the Caribbean islands during the summer and autumn. ### Weather outlook ### Hurricanes are statistically likeliest to hit the Caribbean between mid-August and mid-October, with September the peak for major storms – hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated a number of Caribbean islands in early and mid-September 2017. ### The chances of encountering, or having your travel plans disrupted by, a hurricane in June, July and November are far lower. However, throughout the summer and autumn the weather in the Caribbean is typically stickier and wetter than in the winter and spring months, though rain normally comes as short, heavy downpours rather than prolonged soggy periods. ### Evasive actions ### Cruise lines rely heavily on weather prediction and monitoring systems, and go to great lengths to re-route ships to avoid hurricanes. So even in the peak hurricane period, on a Caribbean cruise it is extremely unlikely you will come face to face with a big storm. A more likely scenario is your cruise being disrupted. For example, the itinerary may be changed at the last minute, so you end up missing ports or visiting different ones. ### Back up ### Particularly if you're cruising during the hurricane season, it's a good idea to take out specialist cruise insurance that should include compensation for missed ports due to bad weather. I'd also advocate buying a cruise as part of a fully-fledged package that includes flights and any hotel stays before or after the cruise. ### Puerto Rico is among the islands badly damaged by hurricanes in recent years Credit: Getty ### Then, should any element of your trip be disrupted by bad weather, you are financially covered and have back up for the whole holiday. Companies offering cruise packages include Virgin Holidays Cruises ( virginholidayscruises.co.uk ) and Trailfinders ( trailfinders.com/cruise) . ### Choice of cruises ### Most of the major, mainstream cruise lines offer Caribbean trips year round, including Carnival, Celebrity Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International. You can sail on eastern, western (including Cuba) and southern Caribbean itineraries through the hurricane season. The most southerly Caribbean islands, such as the Dutch trio of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao, lie outside the so-called hurricane belt and have been rarely hit by major tropical storms, though to reach them you still need to traverse more northerly parts of the Caribbean region that are more commonly affected by hurricanes. ### All that said, in the summer and autumn the choice of Caribbean cruises is not nearly as broad as in the winter. P&O Cruises, Marella Cruises and Fred. Olsen, which are all oriented to British clientele, operate ships in the Caribbean only in the winter months – typically late October/November to March/April. The same is true of upmarket lines with smaller ships that often visit more off-the-beaten-track Caribbean ports, such as Azamara, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, Star Clippers, Seabourn, SeaDream Yacht Club, Silversea and Viking. ### You could head on a Western Caribbean cruise from Miami Credit: Getty ### There's also less choice of departure ports in the hurricane season. In winter, as well as taking a Caribbean cruise from Florida, there are various options for round-trip voyages from Caribbean islands to which you can fly direct from the UK. There's a big choice embarking from Barbados , and some sailings from Jamaica ( Montego Bay ) and Cuba ( Havana ). By contrast, in the summer and autumn months, from those islands there's just the odd sailing from Barbados, and that's it. (You can take cruises year round from San Juan, capital of the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, but that's not convenient for Britons as there are no direct flights there from the UK). ### Peaceful ports ### Less choice has a positive side too – fewer ships in port. I've taken a Caribbean cruise in August. Our stops included San Juan , St Maarten and St Thomas. These are among the busiest cruise-ship ports in the Caribbean, where on some days in the peak winter months multiple ships can be docked at the same time, with beaches and sights overrun with many thousands of cruise-ship passengers. On our trip we were the only ship in port at all six islands we visited. It really made a significant, positive difference to our overall enjoyment of the cruise. ### Deals ### Caribbean cruises can be markedly cheaper in the hurricane season, particularly in the riskiest months. For example, for a week-long Western Caribbean cruise from Miami with Norwegian ( ncl.com ), I'm looking at quotes of from £529 in early September, compared with from £739 in February, travelling on similar-standard ships. And for a seven-night Eastern Caribbean cruise from Miami on Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas ( royalcaribbean.co.uk ), I was quoted from £747 in September, compared with from £909 in February. Fares are cruise-only, based on two sharing an interior cabin. ### Some voyages sail from Cuba Credit: Getty ### Good deals are usually less common in July and August, because demand is high in the school holidays; transatlantic airfares also spike in those months. But also note that on a cruise-and-stay arrangement you're also going to benefit from much lower hotel rates – whether in Florida or the Caribbean – in the low-season summer and autumn months than in the peak-season winter period.

Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. ### Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. ### Rafael Devers homered early for the third-place Red Sox, who fell 8½ games back in the division. That's the furthest they've been behind the Yankees since finishing the 2015 season nine games in the dust. ### PIRATES 9, BREWERS 4 ### PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. ### Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing ""Bellieve"" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. ### Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. ### NEWSLETTERS ### Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. ### REDS 9, NATIONALS 3 ### CINCINNATI (AP) — Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. ### Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. ### Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto's 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. ### Cincinnati's Joey Votto returned after missing three games with a tight right hamstring and had three hits. Eugenio Suarez was back in the lineup after getting hit on the left hand by Clay Holmes' pitch on Wednesday. ### TWINS 5, RAYS 3 ### ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking, two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and Minnesota beat Tampa Bay in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. ### Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. ### José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. ### Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. ### ROCKIES 13, BLUE JAYS 6 ### DENVER (AP) — Trevor Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and the Colorado Rockies beat the slumping Toronto Blue Jays for their sixth straight win. ### It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. ### Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. ### Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. ### ORIOLES 9, GIANTS 5 ### BALTIMORE (AP) — Dwight Smith's first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants. ### Trey Mancini and Renato Núñez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home as the teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. Núñez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. ### Mike Yastrzemski, traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. ### The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. ### Richard Bleier got five outs for his second save. ### WHITE SOX 2, INDIANS 1 ### CHICAGO (AP) — Dylan Covey pitched six effective innings for his first win since August, and the White Sox beat sloppy Cleveland for their season-high fifth straight win. ### Charlie Tilson hit a two-run double to get Chicago's offense rolling. Tilson, Yoán Moncada, Yonder Alonso and Yolmer Sánchez each had two hits. The win moved the White Sox into a second-place tie in the AL Central with Cleveland. ### The Indians committed four errors. Four of Chicago's six runs against slumping Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer were unearned. ### Covey (1-4) settled down after allowing a leadoff homer to Francisco Lindor and scattered eight hits and ended a personal six-game losing streak. Josh Osich and Juan Minaya followed with three innings of one-hit relief. ### Bauer (4-5) allowed nine hits and struck out eight in seven innings, but shaky fielding doomed the right-hander. ### TIGERS 8, BRAVES 2 ### ATLANTA (AP) — Niko Goodrum homered twice and had a career-high five hits, Nicholas Castellanos and Grayson Greiner also went deep, and the Detroit Tigers romped past the Braves. ### Spencer Turnbull (3-4) pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just five hits and one earned run in dealing the Braves their third straight loss at SunTrust Park. ### Goodrum, who came into the night hitting just .208, launched a 419-foot drive that nearly went into the Chop House restaurant above the right-field seats in the third inning. He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. ### After two straight strong starts, Atlanta's Mike Foltynewicz (1-4) had another rough night. Foltynewicz surrendered seven hits and five runs in five innings. ### Atlanta has been outscored 22-6 in its last two defeats. ### RANGERS 6, ROYALS 2 ### ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Joey Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth-inning outburst as the Rangers rallied past the Kansas City Royals. ### Gallo's home run, his team leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet. ### Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. He allowed two runs on five hits and three walks and had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). ### Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks — both in the sixth. ### Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. ### Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Adalberto Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base, giving the Royals a major league-leading 53. ### CARDINALS  2, CUBS 1, 10 INNINGS ### ST. LOUIS (AP) — Matt Carpenter hit a game-ending single against an unusual defensive alignment in the 10th to lead the Cardinals past the Chicago Cubs. ### The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage for May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). They went 8-18 in May 1980. ### Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter, and put four players on the right side of the infield. But Carpenter drove in Wong with a fly ball that found the grass in the left field corner. ### Carlos Martínez pitched a perfect eighth for St. Louis, and Jordan Hicks (2-2) worked two scoreless innings. The last pitch Hicks threw in the ninth registered at 104.3 mph, which is the fastest in baseball this season. ### MARINERS 4, ANGELS 3 ### SEATTLE (AP) — Jay Bruce hit his 300th career home run, Tom Murphy had a two-run shot, and the Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels. ### Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles, achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a dental procedure) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. ### The win snapped the Angels' three-game winning streak and wasted a fairly strong start by the Angels' Tyler Skaggs (4-5), who gave up just five hits but made a handful of costly mistakes while giving up four runs in seven innings. ### The Angels briefly got to Mike Leake (4-6) in the sixth inning when Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani hit back-to-back home runs to left field with two outs. It was the first time Los Angeles has hit consecutive home runs this season, but it wasn't enough for the Angels. ### PADRES 5, MARLINS 2 ### SAN DIEGO (AP) — Franmil Reyes, Hunter Renfroe and Ian Kinsler homered, and left-hander Joey Lucchesi combined with two relievers on a four-hitter for his first victory in six starts to lead the Padres past the Miami Marlins. ### Lucchesi (4-3) hadn't won since beating Cincinnati at home on April 21. He retired his first seven batters before allowing a double by Miguel Rojas in the third. He then retired eight straight before allowing a home run by pinch-hitter Rosell Herrera with one out in the sixth. Lucchesi struck out five and walked one. ### Craig Stammen pitched 1 2/3 hitless innings, Phil Maton allowed two singles to open the Marlins' ninth and Kirby Yates came on to get the final three outs for his 22nd save, best in the majors. ### Herrera was pinch-hitting for lefty Caleb Smith (3-3), who lost his third straight decision after allowing two runs and three hits in five innings. ### DODGERS 6, PHILLIES 3 ### LOS ANGELES (AP) — Max Muncy, Joc Pederson, Corey Seager and Enriquè Hernàndez homered, powering Los Angeles past Philadelphia in the opener of a series matching the National League's best teams. ### The West-leading Dodgers improved to a major league-best 23-7 at home and have won 11 of their last 15 at Chavez Ravine against the East-leading Phillies. The Dodgers' 39 victories lead the NL. Los Angeles rapped out 12 hits while limiting the Phillies to five, including two in the ninth. ### Kenta Maeda (7-2) allowed two runs and three hits in six innings and won his fourth straight start. He struck out six and walked none. Kenley Jansen earned his 17th save. ### Muncy and Seager belted two-run shots and Pederson had a solo homer off Jake Arrieta (5-5), who gave up five runs and 10 hits in five innings, striking out three and walking one. ### Philadelphia's Bryce Harper, Andrew McCutchen and Rhys Hoskins combined to go 2 for 12. McCutchen homered to lead off the fourth. ### ASTROS 3, ATHLETICS 2 ### OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Derek Fisher hit a tiebreaking homer to lead off the eighth inning for his first long ball of the season and the short-handed Houston Astros rallied to beat the Athletics. ### The Astros trailed the A's 2-0 heading into the seventh inning on a night they were missing injured stars Jose Altuvé, Carlos Correa and George Springer. But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A's their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. ### Héctor Rondón (3-1) pitched out of a jam in the seventh with help from a diving stop at shortstop by defensive replacement Jack Mayfield that held Ramón Laureano at third base with the infield drawn in. Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. ### Houston's Josh Reddick snapped an 0-for-15 rut with a solo homer. ### METS 5, DIAMONDBACKS 4 ### PHOENIX (AP) — Carlos Gómez snapped a tie with a pinch-hit double during New York's bizarre two-run eighth inning, sending the Mets past the Arizona Diamondbacks. ### Todd Frazier and Adeiny Hechavarria sparked New York's winning rally with consecutive two-out singles off Matt Andriese (3-4), putting runners on first and third. Pinch hitter J.D. Davis then hit a chopper toward the mound that bounced off Andriese's glove as he reached up. Marte could not handle the ball cleanly as the tying run scored. Gómez followed with a grounder inside the bag at third that drove in Hechavarría, but the ball boy stationed down the line — Arizona uses seniors dubbed ""Golden Glovers"" — fielded the ball thinking it was foul, and Davis was not permitted to score. ### Zack Wheeler (5-3) struck out nine in seven innings, and Robert Gsellman got three outs for his first save. ### Arizona lost its fifth straight game, matching a season high. Christian Walker and Ketel Marte homered for the Diamondbacks. ### ___ ### CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
