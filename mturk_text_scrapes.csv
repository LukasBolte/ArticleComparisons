43401,"Jeopardy! Juggernaut James Holzhauer Is Coming for Ken Jennings' 15-Year Record ###  ### Friday ### May 31, 2019 at 7:37 PM ### After 32 straight wins, James Holzhauer is thiiis close to breaking the all-time Jeopardy! record for most money won, set back in 2004 by Ken Jennings. At the time, Jennings won 74 games straight and took home a prize of $2,520,700. Holzhauer, on the other hand, has won only half that number of games but has racked up $2,462,216. That leaves him $58,484 shy of Jennings record. ### Not only that, Holzhauer also holds the record for most single-game earnings with $131,127. He's set to return to the game show on Monday, when he could break Jennings' record. ### The show is just as impressed with Holzhauer's winning streak as we are, so much so that it made a comparison video (above), breaking down the play-by-play and numbers in comparison to Jennings' run. According to the video, Jennings had an accuracy response rate of 91%, while Holzhauer's is currently at 97%. ### Jennings is perfectly fine, and clearly happy, to hand his winning streak over to a new champion, telling Good Morning America, ""For 15 years, I have thought somebody was going to make a run at this record, because I always knew it could be done. I was there. I saw it happen. What I did not expect was somebody could make a run at the cash record in, like, a third the time."" ### Check your local listings for when Jeopardy! airs in your area. ### Other Links From TVGuide.com Jeopardy!Alex Trebek ### Never miss a story ### Choose the plan that's right for you. ### Digital access or digital and print delivery.",060119,1,"Friday###May 31, 2019 at 7:37 PM###After 32 straight wins, James Holzhauer is thiiis close to breaking the all-time Jeopardy! record for most money won, set back in 2004 by Ken Jennings.

79365,"After making the choice to stay alive, amputees find solace in each other ### By Anita Butcher ### Posted June 02, 2019 07:30:00 ### A split second decision to have his leg amputated changed Peter Allen's life forever. ### Key points: ### Support group Limbs 4 Life is visiting regional areas in South Australia to create a social support network for amputees ### Researchers say support groups can dramatically drop feelings of isolation for people living in regional areas ### Keran Villis says becoming a peer support worker for Limbs 4 Life helped her own recovery as much as it helped her clients ### The diabetic fought an infection in his foot for about three years, until it became a losing battle in January 2018, when he was flown to Adelaide from his Port Augusta home in regional South Australia. ### ""As the doors of the ambulance opened, they were actually waiting for me and I thought, 'I'm in trouble',"" Mr Allen said. ### ""[A surgeon] said, 'I'm going to have to amputate your leg' — I knew this would probably happen, it wasn't a complete shock, but it was one of those moments in your life you do remember and I said, 'Do I have a choice?'"" ### Mr Allen was told he could live for up to five days if he didn't get the amputation done. ### ""I said, 'Is your saw sharp?' She said, 'It's surgically sharp'. I said, 'Go for it'."" ### Rehabilitation was a long process and there was uncertainty around whether he would ever walk again. ### ""I always remember the first time I tried this prosthesis on, and they got me to stand up in the wheelchair, and the feeling of excitement, I could actually stand,"" Mr Allen said. ### Although Mr Allen had the support of his son and assistance from medical professionals, he still felt isolated in his hometown. ### It was not until April this year, that he shared his experiences and spoke with other amputees for the first time at a Limbs 4 Life gathering in Whyalla, about 80 kilometres away. ### This was one of the first sessions the national organisation had held in regional South Australia, with the aim of creating a social support network for amputees living in the area. ### Limbs 4 Life has since travelled to other regions in the state including Port Lincoln, the Riverland and Port Pirie, with plans to set up groups in Mount Gambier and the Barossa Valley. ### Life after surgery ### Dr Sandy Braaf, a research fellow at Monash University who has done work into rehabilitation and recovery for people dealing with traumatic injuries, said peer support groups and social support were vital in helping injured people, particularly those living in rural and regional areas. ### ""There is no doubt that component of their recovery is as equally as important as their physical recovery,"" Dr Braaf said ### In the study she helped conduct, there were massive reductions in feelings of isolation when social support processes were in place. ### ""A lot of people spoke about how their injury or accident had actually changed who they were … and that peer support seemed to fulfil a need in those changes they've undergone."" ### Social connections key to recovery ### Becoming a peer support worker for Limbs 4 Life helped Keran Villis in her recovery as much as it helped her clients. ### The Riverland resident had her leg and part of her hip removed due to a terminal diagnosis of bone cancer in November 2014. ### Photo: After fighting for her life and surviving cancer, Keran Villis had to learn to live without her leg and hip. (ABC Riverland: Anita Butcher) ### Chemotherapy made her very weak and rehabilitation was a difficult process, but she was determined to get out of hospital and be home for Christmas. ### ""That was my aim, to get home and be able to cook, do the dishes, just do all those mundane things — to feel like you're worthwhile, to feel like you're still a mum,"" she said. ### After fighting for her life and surviving cancer, Ms Villis had to learn to live without her leg and hip. ### ""Just mentally, I'm pretty independent and strong minded, so I just wanted to be able to do most things myself, I didn't want to be reliant on others or my kids … [we're] a bit limited on services up here as it is."" ### After connecting with Limbs 4 Life, Ms Villis was encouraged to share her story with other amputees. ### ""It's been good for me to actually meet other people — I've even met somebody in a similar circumstance to myself now which is quite rare, because it's not a common amputation,"" she said. ### ""[It's] empowering to gain knowledge and to know that you're not actually on your own, and that we can help someone else."" ### Kylie Franson, who is the organisation's Peer Support Program Coordinator and born with a congenital upper limb difference, said it made a ""world of difference to meet somebody else who can say they've actually been through that"". ### ""And to be able to share just little hints and tips on living as an amputee, or maybe accessing services. ### ""If you can see other amputees who are perhaps a little further down the track … that can give hope to people.""",060119,1,"Chemotherapy made her very weak and rehabilitation was a difficult process, but she was determined to get out of hospital and be home for Christmas.###"" That was my aim, to get home and be able to cook, do the dishes, just do all those mundane things — to feel like you're worthwhile, to feel like you're still a mum,"" she said.###After fighting for her life and surviving cancer, Ms Villis had to learn to live without her leg and hip.###"" Just mentally, I'm pretty independent and strong minded, so I just wanted to be able to do most things myself , I didn't want to be reliant on others or my kids … [we're] a bit limited on services up here as it is.

Due to the continued renovation of the downtown, you might have forgotten us. It was hard to get to our front door, even harder to keep the walks open and clear. But we are still here, still worshiping in the parish hall, and still without a new roof. ### Why no roof yet, you ask? Well, we are dead set against beginning to spend money we don’t have. We have been busy raising money; possibly too quiet about it. We have raised to date more than $600,000 and we have managed to qualify for two grants. We are proud of our successes. But, dear friends, we still need more money to get the job done, to fix our roof, and move our congregation back into the sanctuary. We want to have you visit the sanctuary too. ### We have the most glorious stained glass windows…do come on a sunny day. We will be happy to give you a tour or just let you wander about and enjoy them without our talking in your ear. We have literature you can take away with you to read later. You can come again and see them after you have read it. Come and enjoy our wonderful Episcopal liturgy with us on Sundays and other days of worship. We will be happy to have you and give you good coffee and something to eat afterward. ### But if you cannot visit, and do not want to join us for worship, will you please consider helping us continue to be present at First and East Main Street to protect our downtown treasures including the only Tiffany window in Central Ohio. If you cannot contribute to our fund raising, could you consider putting a collection can in your business for folks to leave change in? ### We have raised quite a lot that way from the few cans we have out. And, if that is not possible, would you consider talking about the need to help us preserve the history of the downtown by saving the windows given as memorials for those who helped make Newark, Newark. They include veterans from every war since the Civil War: local bankers, merchants, lawyers, and let’s not forget the women who have cooked, cleaned, baked, sewn, and generally made us who we are. All of these folks mean a lot to us, and a lot to you as the past residents of our community, Newark. ### NEWSLETTERS",060119,1,"We have the most glorious stained glass windows… do come on a sunny day.

""Reward"" is a touch more direct than past releases but shares the same subversive grace. ### The record's first line — ""decorate the new discord"" — acts not only as a motif but speaks to the subtle depth that lies within. From there, a subdued saxophone flirts with a flared synth and Le Bon's pillow-y harmonies. Her voice is both expressive and airy and her accent accentuated when she sings. ### On ""The Light,"" Le Bon discloses ""I don't need the poetry"" but her introspection doesn't agree. Even when just ""mouthing the words"" about ""half-used"" intentions, a state of ""occasional bloom"" is depicted. ### At times she seems impenetrable, at others an aching vulnerability is revealed — at one point determining: ""I'm a cross hair."" The intricate hooks also reveal themselves gradually, popping out of nowhere or unfurling deceptively. ### A distinct sense of place and universality are both at play. That dichotomy is part of the draw. ""Home to You"" details the complicated nature of residence, redefining the concept as ""an impasse under hallway ceilings"" or a ""drink from borrowed cups."" ### The instrumental palette is just as whimsical. Elliptical keyboards flutter on buoyant basslines. A dewy slide adorns ""Sad Nudes."" ''Mother's Mother's Magazines"" reads like a Kinks' title and starts out like a song from The Fall before easing back for a brass excursion. ""Magnificent Gestures"" raises the pulse. With an assist from Kurt Vile, Le Bon ruminates on a ""teacher's laugh"" before torpedoing guitar shards take it all down. ### ""Daylight Matters"" is the one to put on repeat. A sultry, almost disco sway meant for late afternoon drifting. Most of this is so pretty it could float around in the background without another thought. But the acute listener is rewarded. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

McCain made for Trump visit ### Posted: 7:43 AM, Jun 01, 2019 ### Updated: 2019-06-01 13:43:05Z ### By: CNN Newsource ### The US Navy acknowledged Friday that a request had been made regarding the USS John S. McCain in relation to President Donald Trump's visit to Japan, but said the ship ended up remaining in its normal configuration. ### The statement continues a saga stemming from emails exchanged between the White House and lower-level US Navy officials about keeping a warship named for the late Sen. John McCain's father and grandfather out of sight ahead of the President's trip. ### ""A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President's visit,"" Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, chief of Navy information, said in a statement. ""There were also no intentional efforts to explicitly exclude Sailors assigned to USS John S. McCain."" ### Brown added that the Navy is ""fully cooperating with the review of this matter tasked by"" acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. ### Two Navy officials told CNN on Wednesday that the White House Military Office had asked lower-level US Navy officials about keeping the ship out of view -- an impractical request as the ship was under repair, one of the officials said. ### ""Once leadership heard about it, they said knock it off,"" a senior Navy official told CNN. ### The ship ultimately was not moved nor was the name obscured, said Cmdr. Clay Doss, a spokesman for the 7th Fleet. ### Trump told reporters Thursday that while he had had no knowledge of the plan nor would he have acted on it, he ""is not a big fan"" of McCain, and whoever was behind the plan was ""well-meaning."" ### When asked abut the controversy Friday, Shanahan maintained that the military would not be politicized, adding that he would not have directed the ship to be moved. ### ""Our business is to run military operations and not to become politicized,"" Shanahan told reporters at a Singapore news conference.

Smollett claimed he was the victim of a racist, anti-gay attack in downtown Chicago in January. ### Foxx said in her Friday statement: ""False rumors circulated that I was related or somehow connected to the Smollett family, so I removed myself from all aspects of the investigation and prosecution ... so as to avoid even the perception of a conflict."" ### But previous explanations suggested that she recused herself in February because of communications with a Smollett family member as the investigation of the reported attack was ongoing. ### Foxx communicated in early February with former first lady Michelle Obama's former chief of staff Tina Tchen, who was representing Smollett's family, and with a member of Smollett's family about the investigation. She recused herself on Feb. 13, and her office cited the communications with the Smollett relative, whom Tchen had encouraged Foxx to call, as the reason for the decision. ### The new documents portrayed her as torn about whether to recuse herself at all. ### In texts with her chief of staff, Jennifer Ballard Croft, Foxx said she was unhappy about having to step away from the investigation — even calling the false rumors ""racist."" ### Get the Breaking News newsletter! ### Get the latest breaking news as it happens. ### Sign up ### By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy . ### An ethics officer, she said, ""told me I had to do it."" She continued: ""There were rumors she claims that I was related to or closely connected to the Smolletts. I told her that wasn't true. She said it was pervasive (in the Chicago Police Department) and that I should recuse. I thought it was dumb but acquiesced. It's actually just racist."" ### Previously released communications also show how Foxx inserted herself in the case even though she had publicly vowed to stay out of the decision-making. ### Parts of the Friday releases, not attributed directly to Foxx but to her office, say the new materials being released ""reveals that the State's Attorney was advised to ""recuse"" herself ... solely based upon rumors that she was related to Smollett — which she is not."" ### It also suggests miscommunication, saying that attorneys within the office advised against using the word ""recusal"" in what Foxx was doing — because they saw no actual conflict of interest. ### ""Those communications were not escalated to the State's Attorney herself,"" she said. ### Smollett faced 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was assaulted by two men early on Jan. 29. Investigators said he made the false report because he was unhappy with his pay on ""Empire"" and believed such an incident would give his career a boost. Foxx's office dropped the charges on March 26 without any admission of guilt by Smollett, prompting a hail of criticism, including from then Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. ### Foxx's office released the hundreds of police reports, warrants, internal emails and texts — that media organization had requested for months — as offices closed for the weekend Friday evening. A judge had approved release of the files last week. ### Among the documents were letters to Foxx from supporters of Smollett in February, urging her office to rethink the charges. ### One letter was from New York attorney Brian Ponder, who wrote ""#NotJustJussie"" in the subject line. ### He wrote in his letter, dated Feb. 21, 2019, that he understood the gravity of a false-report accusation, but added that, ""We trust such charges are not only pursued due to social, political, or racial bias."" He said: ""We trust your office will review, investigate, and charge all false reporters, and not just Jussie. America is watching."" ### The recusal issue has continued to dog the state's attorney's office. ### In late March — after questions were raised about the dropping of charges — Foxx and her aides sought to recast her role, with one statement saying Foxx ""used the term 'recuse'"" in the ""colloquial use of the term."" They said the correct description was that she had ""informally separated herself from the decision-making"" in the case. ### As documents released earlier illustrated, Foxx nevertheless weighed in at critical points as her staff decided whether to proceed with the prosecution, which began when Smollett was charged on Feb. 20. Her input included a March 8 text to First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats, who became the final decision-maker in the Smollett case after Foxx purportedly stepped away. ### Foxx texted: ""Sooo ...... I'm recused, but when people accuse us of overcharging cases ... 16 counts on a class 4 becomes exhibit A."" ### Magats responded to his boss, saying: ""Yes. I can see where that can be seen as excessive."" ### In her direct Friday statement, Foxx called the Smollett case ""unique."" ### ""Allegations of a vicious homophobic and racially motivated attack shook our city and the nation with understandable anger and fear,"" she said. And she added: ""I did not have a conflict of interest in this case; only a sincere desire to serve the community."" ### But she also conceded that the matter, especially on the recusal issue, wasn't handled as well as it could have been. ### ""I regret that my attempts to this end created confusion outside the office,"" she said. She added later: ""I am sorry that despite the best intentions, our efforts were less than what was required of the moment,"" she said. ### By The Associated Press",060119,1,"fbShare Tweet Email###CHICAGO — Chicago's top prosecutor again shifted her explanation for why she recused herself from an investigation into Jussie Smollett's claim that he'd been the target of a hate crime, saying she stepped aside because of false rumors she was related to the ""Empire"" actor.###Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx offered the new public explanation in a statement issued along with the release of 2,000 pages of documents in the case, which also refer to the rumors arising as suspicions grew that Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the attack against himself.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]","<p>fbShare Tweet Email</p><p>CHICAGO — Chicago's top prosecutor again shifted her explanation for why she recused herself from an investigation into Jussie Smollett's claim that he'd been the target of a hate crime, saying she stepped aside because of false rumors she was related to the ""Empire"" actor.</p><p>Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx offered the new public explanation in a statement issued along with the release of 2,000 pages of documents in the case, which also refer to the rumors arising as suspicions grew that Smollett, who is black and gay, staged the attack against himself.</p>"

Perhaps the Rockets had enough magic left for one more comeback? ### “You can only do that so often with this caliber of baseball,” coach Steve Barto said after his top-seeded Rockets fell 4-3 to second-seeded Forbes Road at Somerset High School field. “Forbes Road is a heck of a baseball team. They’re fundamentally sound. We played another good game. They just came up with one and beat us in the ninth.” ### Forbes Road won its first District 5 crown since 2004. The Cardinals (14-6) will face District 6-A runner-up St. Joseph’s Catholic Academy (8-9) in the PIAA Class A tournament on Monday at McConnellsburg. ### Rockwood (16-6) will advance to play District 7-A champion California (18-1) on Monday at Greater Latrobe High School. ### “We’ll play it on Monday and see,” Barto said. ### Each team started its ace and had success on Friday. ### Forbes Road left-hander Caleb Hershey pitched 51/3 innings, holding the Rockets scoreless through three. He struck out five and walked two while scattering five hits. ### Rockwood righty Troy Emert also went 51/3, allowing seven hits while striking out 10 and walking two. ### Each starter gave up two runs. ### Forbes Road took a 1-0 lead in the third as Grayson Hall, Kole Kendall and Logan Deshong hit consecutive singles. ### The Rockets took a 2-1 advantage in the fourth. Emert had an infield single and stole second before scoring on Andrew Weaver’s single. Weaver moved up on a sacrifice bunt, stole third and scored on a passed ball. ### Forbes Road tied the game in the fifth, as Hall singled, Kendall reached on a fielder’s choice and Ethan Wright doubled him home. ### “Hats off to that team,” Barto said. “They’re good.” ### Each team scored in the seventh. ### The Cardinals’ Deshong singled and moved up on an error and a sacrifice bunt. Wright smacked a comebacker to the mound, allowing Deshong to score after the throw to first base. ### “That got us ahead,” said Wright, a senior who had two hits and three RBIs. “It was nerve-wracking, a big AB.” ### Hall had entered the game in relief in the sixth and appeared poised to win the game after getting two quick outs in the bottom of the seventh. ### But the senior Pitt-Johnstown recruit walked four straight batters to force in the tying run before he ended the threat with a fly out. ### “You just had to forget about it. We lucked out and it was still tied in the eighth,” said Hall, who had two hits and reached base four times at the plate. ### “We had to come together as a team.” ### Deshong led off the ninth with a walk, and clean-up hitter Levi Truax put down his second sacrifice bunt of the game. ### Wright laced a single to right field on a 1-2 count. ### “I was focused,” Wright said of the run-scoring hit. “I was really ready for it. We’ve been after this district championship for a long time. It feels really good. This is huge for our school. Our whole school was here supporting us.” ### Hall once again got two outs to open the bottom of the ninth, but Emert singled on a 3-2 count after fouling off three two-strike pitches. This time, Hall got the final out. ### “Emert had a great at-bat the last at-bat in the ninth inning,” Hall said. “I had to throw a strike and get the next guy out. ### “There’s no feeling like that,” Hall said. “It was a great feeling.” ### Mike Mastovich is a sports reporter and columnist for The Tribune-Democrat.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ### Video ### COLUMBUS, Ohio (WKBN) - In the late summer and into the fall of 2018, interest in Issue One picked up steam as we headed into the mid-term elections. ### The ballot measure would have made significant changes to drug sentencing of low-level offenses and do a number of other things at the same time. ### Pushback against the bill was fierce from groups tied to the criminal justice system and ultimately, voters overwhelmingly defeated Issue One at the ballot box. ### Afterward, some who had supported the measure acknowledged that what it wanted to accomplish was pushed too far which resulted in turning popular opinion against it. ### Still, there were parts of the ballot measure that rang true to voters and garnered support. ### Some of those parts are what lawmakers are focusing on in Senate Bill 3 in this General Assembly. ### By trying to work them into existing standards, lawmakers are hoping to avoid having to deal with another ballot issue that takes the power of creating or changing our laws out of their hands. ### Senate Bill 3 is one of several priority bills for the Senate, bills that either one party or both have agreed need to be worked on for the betterment of the people of Ohio. ### You can almost always spot a priority bill due to its number being a single digit. ### Often, that means it was introduced almost immediately or its spot on the list is held intentionally until they are ready to introduce it. ### In this case, the bill was introduced before many of the specifics of it were ready to be documented. ### The original bill analysis simply states lawmakers have the intention to reform drug sentencing, but provides no details as to how. ### Over the past few months, more and more of those details have been worked out and shared through committee hearings and interested party meetings. ### Right now, the bill seeks to do two things: take a harder stance by increasing penalties for trafficking drugs while increasing access to treatment for addition and decreasing penalties for simple users of drugs. ### The bill is described currently as liquid in its fluidity by sponsors of the bill. ### Nothing has been set in stone, which makes it difficult to get completely behind the bill or detract against any one thing. ### However, parties can find themselves coming down on both sides of the fence with this bill. ### The ideas being pushed out for what the bill could be have caused some criminal justice professionals to draw lines in the sand. ### This has mostly been over sentencing standards and whether some 3rd-degree felony drug charges should be downgraded to 4th- and 5th-degree felonies (based on the type of drug and quantities involved), and over the potential downgrade of some current 4th- and 5th-degree felony drug charges being turned into misdemeanor offenses (once again, based on type of drug and quantities). ### There are clear and agreed upon exceptions. Fentanyl, for instance, is not being considered for downgrading in any way. ### The addition of Fentanyl in Issue One became the rallying cry for many in the criminal justice field with then Attorney General Mike DeWine repeatedly stating the measure would make it so someone carrying enough Fentanyl to kill thousands of Ohioans would get a slap on the wrist. ### You could say the lesson was learned, but as Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association Executive Director Louis Tobin says, “The devil is in the details.” ### Right now, based on the way the bill structures which drugs and their quantities would be downgraded, his organization opposes the bill. He says it takes tools away from the criminal justice system. ### “I think a lot of people do realize at some point that ‘[Going to jail/prison] is gonna help me get my life back together,’ and unfortunately some people don’t and they need to spend some time in jail or in prison,” Tobin said. ### Gary Daniels, the chief lobbyist for the ACLU, says this traditional mindset is outdated. ### “We’ve got 40-50 years worth of experience that show that you can’t arrest, convict and incarcerate your way out of this problem,” Daniels said. ### Case in point, Kristen Hughes is a recovering heroin addict and convicted felon. ### Back in 2011, she got busted with two baggies of heroin when an off-duty police officer saw her sell some to another person at a gas station. ### She was charged with felony possession and trafficking, and she was given probation. ### In 2013, she violated her probation by testing positive for narcotics on a drug screening and went to jail for 18 months. ### She says that while she was in jail, it was harder to get drugs and she received no treatment for her addiction. ### She says her behavior never changed after being sent to prison and her mindset was the same as it was when she was out on the street. ### After getting out of prison, she was placed on five years of community control for other non-violent felony crimes she had committed. ### “I wasn’t even out for six months and went right back again,” Hughes said. ### She couldn’t keep clean. ### After doing her time, she was once more released with community controls and just like the last time, she messed up again. ### She admits that she should have gone back to prison again, but this was just a few years ago and a shift was beginning to happen in Ohio. ### Instead of sending her to prison, she was given an alternative; go to a correctional facility-run treatment program. ### She agreed, and while she was there she finally started to learn what she needed to do to get clean and stay that way. ### Hughes' addiction and poor choices earlier in life have caused her to rack up a number of felony convictions. ### Under Senate Bill 3, some of them could have been misdemeanors, but Hughes doesn’t think that is a good thing. ### “If you don’t have consequences for your actions, then people will continue to use,” she said. “It would be nice to not have the felony on my record but, you know, I don’t feel like I would have learned what I have from the mistakes that I’ve made.” ### And she says there is always expungement. ### Currently, up to five of the records of some 4th- and 5th-degree felony charges can be sealed and you do not have to admit to having them when filling out a job application. ### There is a piece of legislation making its way through the Ohio House of Representatives that would eliminate the cap of five and make it an unlimited number of 4th- and 5th-degree felony charges (with restrictions for certain types). ### Still, Hughes says had she received treatment instead of going to prison for 18 months, she is confident she would not have lost all of that time. ### Senate Bill 3 is currently set up so that treatment opportunities are prioritized over being sent to jail or prison. It also offers that if the treatment program is completed, the charges would be dismissed. ### The Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association says it is not opposed to the spirit of what the bill is trying to do and certainly would support the promotion of expanding treatment options. ### However, they have grave concerns that changing the sentencing structures will only embolden drug traffickers and cartels and say that our current laws are working in a regulatory fashion. ### According to Tobin, cartels know how much they can traffic before their “employees” are hit with more serious charges. So by adjusting the amounts of drugs a person can have on them down, it would allow traffickers to bring more drugs with less risk. ### For example, it is a 3rd-degree felony to have 301 doses of a drug that carries an eight-year maximum sentence and having 299 doses is only a 4th-degree felony that carries a maximum of two years.

72434,"Mueller intended to break Democrats' impeachment stalemate ### Walter Shapiro ### • ### May 31, 2019 ### Unless they are on a secret Washington dinner party circuit, there are no hints that Robert Mueller and Nancy Pelosi are friends. ### Sure, they overlapped 20 years ago with Mueller serving as US attorney for the northern district of California and Pelosi in her second decade representing San Francisco in Congress. And, like all prominent Washington public officials, they shared TV green rooms when Mueller was FBI director and Pelosi was on her first circuit as House speaker. ### Related: Mueller stopped short of calling Trump a criminal, but did we need him to? | Richard Wolffe ### Despite their differing persona, these two past-normal-retirement-age figures born in the early 1940s boast important affinities. In a political age defined by corrosive cynicism, they both share an old-fashioned belief in institutions whether they are Mueller’s justice department or Pelosi’s House of Representatives. ### That institutional faith pinpoints Mueller’s target audience for his nine-minute coda to this tenure as special counsel. In an extreme example of narrowcasting, masked by the careful legalistic language, Mueller was speaking directly to Pelosi. ### His implicit message: my institution (the justice department) cannot indict a sitting president. But your institution (the House) can vote to impeach Donald Trump and mandate a Senate trial for obstruction of justice and possible other “high crimes and misdemeanors”. ### Much of Mueller’s statement served as an explanation of the constraints that he felt because of a justice department legal interpretation that he cannot indict a sitting president. As Mueller bluntly put it: “A special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy.” ### Then Mueller, in the same procedural step-by-step tone of a legal indictment, went on to deliver one of the most important sentences of his tenure as special counsel: “The constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.” ### Mueller could not have been clearer about impeachment if he had stepped before the cameras with a scarlet I pinned to his suit. ### Up to now, the debates over impeachment roiling the House Democratic caucus have either been political (“It will cost us seats in 2020”) or moral (“How can we tell our grandchildren that we did nothing in the face of Trump’s lawless behavior?”). ### But Mueller, in his subtle, understated fashion, tried to break this Democratic stalemate. He offered a new argument and perhaps the only one that could possibly trump Pelosi’s hard-won political caution. What Mueller was saying, in effect, was that the constitution and the institutional legitimacy of Congress as an independent body require commencing impeachment hearings. ### Of course, Mueller’s understanding of institutional imperatives means that he would be about as reluctant an impeachment witness as a straight-arrow cop testifying in a police corruption scandal. ### Mueller’s other message to Pelosi on Wednesday was to try to convince her not to compel his congressional testimony. He broadly hinted that he would answer all questions with boring-for-television lines such as: “You will find my answer on page 84 of the second section of my report.” ### There is a common misunderstanding about an impeachment inquiry. The dominant impression seems to be that the House judiciary committee would open hearings on a Tuesday, vote out an impeachment resolution on a Wednesday and have it pass the House on a party-line vote (plus anti-Trump GOP apostate Justin Amash ) on Thursday. Then, a week later, Mitch McConnell and company would find Trump “not guilty” in the Senate. ### Impeachment hearings can and should be as deliberate as the Mueller inquiry itself ### But impeachment hearings can and should be as deliberate as the Mueller inquiry itself. Unlike 1974, when the Richard Nixon impeachment hearings built on the earlier dramatic public testimony of the Senate Watergate committee, this time around the House judiciary committee’s efforts would need to be both investigative and prosecutorial. Witnesses such as the former White House counsel Don McGahn and Hope Hicks, the former communications director, would have a hard time dodging congressional subpoenas for a constitutionally sanctioned impeachment hearing no matter how ardently Trump claimed executive privilege. ### Mueller had a narrow mandate, but there are no such limitations on impeachment hearings. ### Trump’s shameless profiteering in the White House, with some of the money coming from foreign sources, may well violate the “ emoluments clause ” of the constitution. His conduct in office also raises grave national security questions from secret meetings (with no American note-takers) with Vladimir Putin to Jared Kushner’s dubious top-level access to secret documents. ### Mueller may be faulted for being too punctilious in his fidelity to justice department rules and precedents. But he followed what he saw as the path dictated by integrity to the end. Now it is up to Pelosi also to transcend politics – and do what the constitution demands. ### What to Read Next",060119,1,"Then Mueller, in the same procedural step-by-step tone of a legal indictment, went on to deliver one of the most important sentences of his tenure as special counsel: “The constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing. ”###Mueller could not have been clearer about impeachment if he had stepped before the cameras with a scarlet I pinned to his suit.###Up to now, the debates over impeachment roiling the House Democratic caucus have either been political ( “ It will cost us seats in 2020”) or moral ( “How can we tell our grandchildren that we did nothing in the face of Trump’s lawless behavior?”).","[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]","<p>Then Mueller, in the same procedural step-by-step tone of a legal indictment, went on to deliver one of the most important sentences of his tenure as special counsel: “The constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing. ”</p><p>Mueller could not have been clearer about impeachment if he had stepped before the cameras with a scarlet I pinned to his suit.</p><p>Up to now, the debates over impeachment roiling the House Democratic caucus have either been political ( “ It will cost us seats in 2020”) or moral ( “How can we tell our grandchildren that we did nothing in the face of Trump’s lawless behavior?”).</p>"

36586,"Top Five Most Effective Ways To Save Money On Auto Insurance Premiums ### PRWeb ### 7:10 pm EDT, Saturday, June 1, 2019 ### Compare-autoinsurance.org ( https://compare-autoinsurance.org/ ) announces a new blog post, “5 Smart Tips For Saving On Car Insurance” ### Los Angeles, CA (PRWEB) June 01, 2019 ### Compare-autoinsurance.org has launched a new blog post that presents several smart ways that can help drivers pay less on their car insurance . ### For more info and free online car insurance quotes, please visit https://compare-autoinsurance.org/5-smart-tips-for-saving-on-car-insurance/ ### Many drivers are concerned about the car insurance premiums that seem to increase after each renewal. To drive a vehicle legally, drivers need insurance, but for some of them, car insurance has become too expensive. However, there are certain things a driver can do to keep the car insurance under control or even lower it. ### Drivers that want to pay less on their car insurance should follow the next tips: ### Be a good driver. Insurance providers appreciate safe drivers who do not commit accidents or traffic violations. Being fined for traffic violations will increase the premiums upon the next renewal. Depending on the nature and the severity of the committed traffic violation, policyholders can expect to have their premiums prices doubled. ### Pay for the whole policy at once. Drivers can save money by choosing to pay in advance for their policies. Most insurers will offer a small discount to those policyholders that pay their whole policies at once. Drivers that choose to pay monthly are usually charged with a small administration fee. ### Maintain a good credit score. Studies done by the insurance companies have shown there is a correlation between the credit score of a driver and the possibility for that driver to make a claim. For this reason, car insurance companies charge more on drivers with low credit scores and will charge less on drivers with good or excellent credit scores. ### Drive fewer miles. Policyholders that moved closer to their workplace, retired, or just simply drive fewer miles should contact their insurer. Insurance companies offer discounts that can be as large as 20% to those drivers that drive fewer miles than a certain amount. ### Compare online quotes. To find a better insurance deal, drivers are recommended to compare at least three online quotes from different insurance companies. ### For additional info, money-saving tips and free car insurance quotes, visit https://compare-autoinsurance.org/   In this way, clients have access to offers from multiple carriers all in one place: this website.  ### For the original version on PRWeb visit: https://www.prweb.com/releases/top_five_most_effective_ways_to_save_money_on_auto_insurance_premiums/prweb16350977.htm",060119,1,"Drive fewer miles.

34286,"DOJ edges toward Google antitrust probe ### Some call for tougher regulation of industry ### By: ### Posted: Jun 01, 2019 04:31 PM EDT ### Updated: Jun 01, 2019 05:10 PM EDT ### Facebook, Google and Twitter sign pledge to combat online extremism ### The Justice Department is laying the foundation for a potential antitrust investigation of Google, three people familiar with the matter say — zeroing in on one of the world's wealthiest and most powerful tech companies as policymakers around the globe are calling for tougher regulation of an increasingly embattled industry. ### Negotiations between DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission in recent weeks have resulted in the Justice Department gaining control over a possible investigation of the tech giant, the people said on Saturday. ### The decision reflects the first steps in what could become a wide-ranging probe into the company's business practices. While the scope of DOJ's interest is unclear, agency regulators led by antitrust chief Makan Delrahim may focus their attention on Google's search business, according to two of the people familiar with the possible probe. Google's advertising practices could also come under scrutiny, said one of the people. ### A looming DOJ investigation poses the newest and most serious challenge yet to the tech industry from Washington, where political leaders have accused Silicon Valley titans of strangling competition and in some cases have demanded the companies be broken up. Those calls have been spurred on by an endless string of privacy mishaps, misinformation scandals and the proliferation of graphic and hateful content on the tech platforms. ### Google, which has said healthy and thriving markets are in everyone's interest, declined to comment on the potential probe. The Justice Department and FTC also declined comment. ### A fresh investigation of Google by US regulators could reopen old wounds. The company was last under investigation by the FTC as recently as 2013, but emerged relatively unscathed after the firm pledged to change certain aspects of its business, such as how it handles content from third-party travel or shopping sites. The FTC then closed the investigation. ### The Justice Department's recent talks with the FTC — a process known as ""clearance"" — suggest the likelihood of a new probe is high, some analysts say. ### ""If there were a clearance fight over a Google investigation — this is such a big matter that whoever won the clearance fight would almost certainly be opening an investigation,"" said Michael Kades, a former FTC antitrust attorney. ### Still, just because DOJ is taking on responsibility for Google's oversight does not mean an investigation has been opened or that the agency is imminently poised to act against Google, said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official. ### ""This is a warning sign for Google,"" he said. ""It's quite clear the Department of Justice will be at least scrutinizing their behavior very carefully."" ### Regulators' renewed scrutiny of Google is reminiscent of the critical reception the search giant has faced in Europe in recent years. EU officials have slapped Google with billions of dollars in fines for allegedly anticompetitive practices. Those practices ranged from Google's advertising rules for websites to its bundling of proprietary apps on Android smartphones. ### Maureen Ohlhausen, a former acting chairman of the FTC, said the tech industry's fall from political grace has raised expectations for the nation's top competition enforcers — and for Delrahim to ""[stake] out new territory for DOJ."" ### ""With the continuing techlash from the right and the left, both antitrust agencies are under pressure to escalate their actions,"" she said. ### One complicating factor for US regulators may be President Donald Trump, who has mused in public about ""looking at"" companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google from an antitrust lens. Trump has repeatedly shown an interest in regulating tech platforms. But his remarks have proven controversial because antitrust investigations are supposed to take place free from White House influence. ### Similar concerns surrounded the Justice Department's 2017 antitrust lawsuit against AT&T — now the parent company of WarnerMedia, which owns CNN — as the telecom giant sought to acquire Time Warner. In federal court, AT&T sought White House communications logs that could have shed light on the matter, but a judge restricted the case to economic analysis. ### ""The companies ought to be careful about how they behave at this moment,"" Kimmelman added. ""But I also think there will be enormous scrutiny of what the enforcement officials do, and why they do it.""",060119,1,"The decision reflects the first steps in what could become a wide-ranging probe into the company's business practices.

It added that the company wasn't told by anyone to divert the packages. ### Huawei officials have questioned whether the diversions were truly inadvertent. ### ""I don't think it is right for any company to intercept or detain individual documents or information,"" Song Liuping, Huawei's chief legal officer, told reporters Wednesday.

11254,"Trump Slams Democrats on Abortion: “Their Radical Position on Abortion is Horrible” ### Micaiah Bilger   May 31, 2019   |   6:45PM    Washington, DC ### Share this story: ### Abortions for any reason up to birth and sometimes after birth, too. Taxpayer-funded abortions. No abortion clinic regulations or informed consent. Abortions for 12-year-olds without their parents’ knowledge. ### ADVERTISEMENT ### It’s a “horrible” position to take, President Donald Trump said Thursday. But it is the position that many leading Democrat politicians in America are taking today. ### The Epoch Times reports Trump called out pro-abortion Democrats for supporting a radical abortion agenda in Illinois and other parts of the country. ### This week, Illinois state lawmakers are ramming through a bill that would legalize abortions for basically any reason up to birth . Despite widespread public opposition, the Illinois House quickly and quietly passed the bill on Tuesday. ### “The Democrat Party is unhinged! Their radical position on abortion is horrible!” Trump wrote Thursday on Twitter, linking to a Townhall report about the bill. ### While the mainstream media focuses on pro-life laws being passed in Louisiana, Georgia and Missouri, radical pro-abortion bills in Illinois, Vermont and Rhode Island largely have gone unnoticed by the national press. ### Trump is one of the few people with a huge platform who has been raising awareness about these bills. ### Click here to sign up for pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com ### If the Illinois bill passes the state Senate, abortion clinic regulations could be a thing of the past. Among other things, the Illinois Reproductive Health Act would repeal state abortion clinic regulations and the state partial-birth abortion ban. ### The Thomas More Society described the bill as “the most radical piece of abortion legislation that has ever been introduced in Illinois.” It would create a “fundamental right” to abortion and prevent the state from interfering in any way with the killing of unborn babies. It also would require every health insurance plan to cover elective abortions, with no exceptions for religious or moral objections. ### A second bill would repeal the state parental notification law, which requires underage girls to inform at least one parent before she has an abortion. ### Illinois is not alone. Vermont lawmakers passed a similar pro-abortion bill earlier this month. Even more expansive than the New York law that Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed in January , the Vermont bill would recognize abortion as a “fundamental human right,” and allow abortions for any reason up to birth. It also would remove protections for pregnant women who are victims of violence and medical malpractice. ### That bill is awaiting action on Vermont Gov. Phil Scott’s desk. ### Rhode Island and New Mexico lawmakers narrowly defeated similar pro-abortion bills in their state legislatures this spring. ### Nationally, the Democratic Party platform s upports abortions without restriction and taxpayer-funded abortions . This year, party leaders repeatedly have blocked a federal bill to protect newborns from infanticide , including every U.S. Senate Democrat who is running for president . ### This position is radically out of touch with most voters’ views on abortion. A new Hill-HarrisX survey found that 55 percent of voters said they do not think laws banning abortions after six weeks – when an unborn baby’s heartbeat is detectable – are too restrictive. ### Earlier this year, a Marist University poll found that just 13 percent of Americans support the New York law that legalized abortions for basically any reason up to birth.",060119,1,"“ The Democrat Party is unhinged!

49407,"Fred Mawer ### It's possible to take a Caribbean cruise any time of the year. That includes during the Atlantic hurricane season, which officially runs from June 1 to November 30. You might think it's best to cruise in another part of the world during those months. But it's not as clear-cut as that, and there are in fact some compelling reasons to cruise around the Caribbean islands during the summer and autumn. ### Weather outlook ### Hurricanes are statistically likeliest to hit the Caribbean between mid-August and mid-October, with September the peak for major storms – hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated a number of Caribbean islands in early and mid-September 2017. ### The chances of encountering, or having your travel plans disrupted by, a hurricane in June, July and November are far lower. However, throughout the summer and autumn the weather in the Caribbean is typically stickier and wetter than in the winter and spring months, though rain normally comes as short, heavy downpours rather than prolonged soggy periods. ### Evasive actions ### Cruise lines rely heavily on weather prediction and monitoring systems, and go to great lengths to re-route ships to avoid hurricanes. So even in the peak hurricane period, on a Caribbean cruise it is extremely unlikely you will come face to face with a big storm. A more likely scenario is your cruise being disrupted. For example, the itinerary may be changed at the last minute, so you end up missing ports or visiting different ones. ### Back up ### Particularly if you're cruising during the hurricane season, it's a good idea to take out specialist cruise insurance that should include compensation for missed ports due to bad weather. I'd also advocate buying a cruise as part of a fully-fledged package that includes flights and any hotel stays before or after the cruise. ### Puerto Rico is among the islands badly damaged by hurricanes in recent years Credit: Getty ### Then, should any element of your trip be disrupted by bad weather, you are financially covered and have back up for the whole holiday. Companies offering cruise packages include Virgin Holidays Cruises ( virginholidayscruises.co.uk ) and Trailfinders ( trailfinders.com/cruise) . ### Choice of cruises ### Most of the major, mainstream cruise lines offer Caribbean trips year round, including Carnival, Celebrity Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International. You can sail on eastern, western (including Cuba) and southern Caribbean itineraries through the hurricane season. The most southerly Caribbean islands, such as the Dutch trio of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao, lie outside the so-called hurricane belt and have been rarely hit by major tropical storms, though to reach them you still need to traverse more northerly parts of the Caribbean region that are more commonly affected by hurricanes. ### All that said, in the summer and autumn the choice of Caribbean cruises is not nearly as broad as in the winter. P&O Cruises, Marella Cruises and Fred. Olsen, which are all oriented to British clientele, operate ships in the Caribbean only in the winter months – typically late October/November to March/April. The same is true of upmarket lines with smaller ships that often visit more off-the-beaten-track Caribbean ports, such as Azamara, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, Star Clippers, Seabourn, SeaDream Yacht Club, Silversea and Viking. ### You could head on a Western Caribbean cruise from Miami Credit: Getty ### There's also less choice of departure ports in the hurricane season. In winter, as well as taking a Caribbean cruise from Florida, there are various options for round-trip voyages from Caribbean islands to which you can fly direct from the UK. There's a big choice embarking from Barbados , and some sailings from Jamaica ( Montego Bay ) and Cuba ( Havana ). By contrast, in the summer and autumn months, from those islands there's just the odd sailing from Barbados, and that's it. (You can take cruises year round from San Juan, capital of the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, but that's not convenient for Britons as there are no direct flights there from the UK). ### Peaceful ports ### Less choice has a positive side too – fewer ships in port. I've taken a Caribbean cruise in August. Our stops included San Juan , St Maarten and St Thomas. These are among the busiest cruise-ship ports in the Caribbean, where on some days in the peak winter months multiple ships can be docked at the same time, with beaches and sights overrun with many thousands of cruise-ship passengers. On our trip we were the only ship in port at all six islands we visited. It really made a significant, positive difference to our overall enjoyment of the cruise. ### Deals ### Caribbean cruises can be markedly cheaper in the hurricane season, particularly in the riskiest months. For example, for a week-long Western Caribbean cruise from Miami with Norwegian ( ncl.com ), I'm looking at quotes of from £529 in early September, compared with from £739 in February, travelling on similar-standard ships. And for a seven-night Eastern Caribbean cruise from Miami on Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas ( royalcaribbean.co.uk ), I was quoted from £747 in September, compared with from £909 in February. Fares are cruise-only, based on two sharing an interior cabin. ### Some voyages sail from Cuba Credit: Getty ### Good deals are usually less common in July and August, because demand is high in the school holidays; transatlantic airfares also spike in those months. But also note that on a cruise-and-stay arrangement you're also going to benefit from much lower hotel rates – whether in Florida or the Caribbean – in the low-season summer and autumn months than in the peak-season winter period.

46968,"Guinea Bissau: Guinea-Bissau's Election Delivers Renewed Deadlock Instead of Solutions ### Tagged: ### analysis ### By Paulin Maurice Toupane ### Just two months after the 10 March legislative election, Guinea-Bissau is once again stuck in a political stalemate. The conflict is driven by the same partisan interests that precipitated similar events four years ago. For many outside the country, these elections were meant to solve the crippling 2015 crisis. However, holding elections in a tense context and without political reforms having been implemented, made deadlock inevitable. ### The political quarrels between the two parliamentary groups formed after the election hinder the full establishment of the office of the National People's Assembly (NPA), the appointment of the prime minister and the formation of a new government. ### The standoff further weakens the country's already dire socio-economic situation, which could jeopardise presidential elections planned for between 23 October and 25 November. The end of President José Mário Vaz's five-year term in office, scheduled for 23 June, combined with the absence of a new government, creates an institutional vacuum that will make resolving this new impasse that much harder. ### The current standoff in Guinea-Bissau involves the same adversaries as those in the 2015 crisis ### The root cause of the stalemate is the rejection of Braima Camará as the second vice-president of the NPA. Camará, who is coordinator of the Movement for Democratic Alternation-G15 (MADEM-G15), was snubbed by the new parliamentary majority led by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). Tensions escalated further when MADEM-G15 refused to choose another candidate, insisting on Camará. ### The 2015 crisis that paralysed Guinea-Bissau's government involved the same adversaries. It was sparked by the dismissal of former prime minister Domingos Simões Pereira by Vaz. Pereira heads the PAIGC which won the March elections with 47 seats out of 102. A parliamentary alliance was formed with its traditional allies, bringing a further seven seats. ### MADEM-G15, created in 2018 by PAIGC dissidents, is now the second largest political grouping with 27 seats. Together with the Party for Social Renewal, which garnered 21 seats, both are Vaz allies. The president has made the appointment of a new prime minister conditional on resolving the NPA impasse. This raises suspicions that he's trying to block Pereira - as head of the majority PAIGC alliance - from again becoming prime minister. ### This new episode breaks the momentum that began when the Stability Pact was signed in February 2019. The pact bound political leaders to stabilising the country's politics and institutions after the parliamentary elections. It also shows the inability of political actors to transcend their differences in the interest of a country that desperately needs their full attention. As political differences persist, the deteriorating socio-economic situation and impact of drug trafficking deepen insecurity. ### In the middle of Guinea-Bissau's electoral campaign, police made a record seizure of 789 kg of cocaine ### Decades of political instability have made it difficult to implement public policy and the level of human development in Guinea-Bissau remains low. In 2018, the country ranked 177 out of 188 on the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Index. Poverty affects more than 58.4% of the population. The country's economy depends on cashew nuts, its main export product. But profits are constrained as the price is set by government. ### To make matters worse, a series of strikes was initiated by the country's two main trade unions, Guinea Bissau's National Union of Workers and the General Confederation of Independent Trade Unions. They are demanding payment of salary arrears and a revaluation of the 100 000 FCFA minimum wage. Meeting these demands will be difficult. The country faces budgetary stress due largely to the low export price of cashew nuts in 2018, and the increase in public spending, including on the March elections. ### In this precarious political and economic environment, organised crime networks continue to prosper with the complicity of certain government actors. On 9 March, while the country was in the middle of the electoral campaign, police made a record seizure of 789 kg of cocaine. On 30 April, 72 kg of cocaine from Guinea-Bissau were seized by Senegalese customs in the Tambacounda region in eastern Senegal. ### Organised crime networks continue to prosper with the complicity of certain government actors ### These seizures are a reminder that the country remains a major transit area for international drug trafficking, and that a lot more needs to be done about it. The capacity of the judicial police in Guinea-Bissau must be strengthened and cooperation with neighbouring countries boosted. ### Considering the enormity of the task, political leaders cannot afford to alienate the electorate. The massive voter turnout in the 2014 elections, like the March 2019 poll, showed the hope of a nation desperate to turn the page on political instability and poverty that have beset the country since independence in 1974. ### However, as personal and political ambitions continue to prevail over the national interest, Guinea-Bissau's people - the real victims of the country's chronic instability - could become disenchanted with the democratic process. To end the crisis, Guinea-Bissau's leaders need to transcend their partisan interests. Agreement is needed on the necessary steps to form a legitimate government that can appease social tensions and prepare for the presidential election. ### Paulin Maurice Toupane, Researcher, Regional Office for West Africa, the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, Dakar ### Guinea Bissau",060119,1,"To make matters worse, a series of strikes was initiated by the country's two main trade unions, Guinea Bissau's National Union of Workers and the General Confederation of Independent Trade Unions.

Michael Vosburg / Forum Photo Editor2 / 3 ### Lisa Peltier of Valley City, N.D., holds a 100-year-old wood carving by her great uncle during filming of the Antiques Road Show on Saturday, June 1, at Bonanzaville in West Fargo. Michael Vosburg / Forum Photo Editor3 / 3 ### WEST FARGO — Nearly 7,000 applied for tickets to a taping of Antiques Roadshow in hopes they would be one of about 4,000 ticket holders bringing items to Bonanzaville for professional appraisals to determine if they truly have something with one-of-a-kind value. ### In the PBS television show's first trip to the Fargo area, producers said the Cass County Historical Society's Pioneer Village was the perfect backdrop to film three episodes of the show. ### As ticket holders arrived on Saturday, June 1, their items were divided into more than 20 categories from art, furniture, jewelry and collectibles to toys and artifacts. ### Ticket holders then met with one of more than 70 professional appraisers, who flew in from across the nation and volunteered their time to get a look at sometimes rare and unique pieces. If the appraiser finds an interesting piece, whether it will likely be worth a lot of money or possibly a one of a kind item, they then turn to producers who may choose the item to be appraised on camera by the show's hosts. ### Some bringing items to the taping hoped to hear their item was worth a lot of money, but others just wanted to know if their item was of top quality such as Lisa from Valley City, who was chosen to have wood carvings done by her great uncle in the early 1900s looked at by an appraiser. ### Lisa, whose last name was not released per request by Antiques Roadshow management, was only interested in finding out if a professional admired the quality of her family's work. ### ""[The appraiser] talked about the skill it took to make these,"" she said. ""Money wasn't why I wanted to do this at all."" ### Fargo resident Les was hoping to hear the antique pedal car he had fully restored would hold value. ### ""I can't even venture to guess what it might be appraised at,"" he said. ### For Executive Producer Marsha Bemko, the unique stories that can be uncovered during the appraisal process is what she holds closest. At Saturday's taping, Bemko said she met a woman whose mother worked as a silversmith under Georg Jensen, a renowned Danish silversmith in the late 1800s and early 1900s. ### ""She would have been the only woman working as a silversmith in that shop,"" Bemko said. The woman's daughter brought in not only silver created by her mother with the Jensen signature, but a handwritten letter of recommendation he wrote for the woman when she decided to leave his shop and create her own art. ### The items were valued at $25,000 to $30,000, but the story behind the items is priceless, Bemko said. ### ""I just loved hearing about that girl's story,"" she said. ### Another favorite item of Bemko's that appeared Saturday was a textile piece a local man had taken from the site of the former World Trade Center. The man was helping with restoration after the September 11 attacks and he was allowed to keep the item. ### ""It's really an interesting story, I can't wait to air it,"" Bemko said. ### Antiques Roadshow will be in its 24th season on PBS when the three hour-long episodes filmed at Bonanzaville air in 2020. ### Additional Articles Recommended by Jamestown Sun",060119,1,""" She would have been the only woman working as a silversmith in that shop,"" Bemko said.

31699,"Claudia Morell/WBEZ ### Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot following her first City Council meeting on May 29, 2019. ### Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Friday demanded that indicted Ald. Ed Burke step down immediately from the Southwest Side seat he’s held for more than half a century. ### More content below this sponsor message ### Lightfoot doubled down on her earlier call for Burke to step down during a press conference Friday morning. That’s after Thursday afternoon’s long-anticipated federal indictment came down on the veteran 14th Ward alderman, slapping him with 14 new corruption-related counts . ### “The superseding indictment alleges that Alderman Burke used his power and influence to compel city employees and others to bend to his will all in the service — not of the people — but of his corrupt pecuniary interest,” Lightfoot said. “And for these reasons I believe that he has forfeited his moral authority and the privilege he needs to continue as alderman of the 14th Ward.” ### Lightfoot said she would memorialize her resignation request in a formal letter to Burke. ### Burke is accused of using his powerful perch at City Hall to steer business to his private law firm, which deals in property tax appeals. He was charged with attempted extortion in January , and Thursday’s indictment added racketeering and bribery charges to his case. ### The indictment laid out one alleged scheme dating back to 2016, in which Burke used his former position as the chair of the City Council Finance Committee to block developers of the Old Main Post Office site from getting a taxpayer subsidy until they hired his law firm. ### Stay up-to-date with the latest news, stories and insider events. ### Please enter a valid email address Oops, something went wrong! ### Sign Up ### Try Again ### You've signed up to receive emails. Please check your email for a welcome confirmation. ### In another case, federal prosecutors say Burke threatened to hold up an admission fee increase requested by the Field Museum in an effort to get a friend’s child an internship there. ### Lightfoot pointed to those alleged schemes on Friday to say that new charges suggest Burke’s way of doing business at City Hall has been “absolutely repugnant.” ### The mayor is a former federal prosecutor who previously took part in one of the largest takedowns of aldermanic corruption, known as Operation Silver Shovel. Still, she said the indictment against Burke was unprecedented. ### There was “nothing like” what’s been alleged in the federal case against Burke, she said Friday. “It is just a degree different and more serious and more wide-ranging and more problematic.” ### The new mayor said Burke’s own words caught on wiretap are “most damning,” and illustrate how embedded the culture of corruption is at City Hall. The indictment is full of alleged conversations Burke had with aldermen and his staff as he allegedly tried to extort developers and others who had business before the city. ### “If you are in this to make money, you are in the wrong job,” Lightfoot warned. She has asked the city’s law department to investigate whether any current city employees were involved in the alleged schemes outlined by federal authorities. She also stressed whistleblowers will be protected. ### “We’ve got to restore integrity and legitimacy, and that’s obviously not going to be easy to change these kinds of cultural mores, but I am determined to do everything I can to change it,” she said. ### Burke, the City Council’s longest-serving alderman, has quickly become Lightfoot’s main political nemesis. After he was charged in January, she worked to use him as a poster child for self-dealing and corruption in city government. ### But the mayor doesn’t have the authority to force an alderman to resign. Burke was re-elected handily in February, despite the federal cloud hanging over him. And aldermen can’t be made to relinquish their seats unless they’re convicted of a crime. ### Burke’s attorneys maintain he has done nothing wrong. He’s set to be arraigned in federal court Tuesday morning. ### Claudia Morell covers city politics for WBEZ. Follow her @claudiamorell .",060119,1,"You've signed up to receive emails.

(AP) — The Latest on flooding in the United States (all times local): ### 4 p.m. ### Emergency officials are conducting water rescues in the tiny northwestern Missouri town of Levasy in the wake of a levee breach along the Missouri River. ### Kansas City station WDAF reports the breach happened Saturday, flooding part of the town of about 80 people. Levasy is located about 26 miles (42 kilometers) east of Kansas City on U.S. Highway 24 just south of the Missouri River. ### The Jackson County Sheriff's Office and the Missouri State Highway Patrol were conducting the rescues by boat Saturday. Access to Levasy is restricted to residents only. Proof of residency is required to enter. ### No injuries have been reported. ### ——— ### 3:15 p.m. ### A temporary flood barrier at Burlington, Iowa, along the swollen Mississippi River has failed, sending floodwaters rushing into the city's downtown. ### The National Weather Service says Burlington officials have confirmed that a large, sand-filled barrier failed Saturday afternoon, forcing some businesses in the downtown area to evacuate. ### The weather service has issued a flash flood warning for the area until 10 p.m. Saturday, saying a four- to six-block area of downtown Burlington is being affected. ### Authorities urged people in the area to seek higher ground and avoid driving or walking through flooded areas. ### The barrier breach is reminiscent of a similar breach April 30 at Davenport, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) upstream on the Mississippi River. That breach also sent floodwater rushing over several blocks of downtown Davenport. ### Burlington, population 25,000, is about 170 miles (274 kilometers) southeast of Des Moines. ### ——— ### 12:45 p.m. ### City officials in Dardanelle, Arkansas, are trying a ""last ditch effort"" to save the south side of the town from encroaching Arkansas River floodwater that is pouring through a breached levee. ### Mayor Jimmy Witt said Saturday that he didn't believe a temporary levee being constructed will stop the water, but that hopes it will buy time for residents of up to 800 homes to make preparations. ### Officials say there's no way of telling how bad the flooding could get, but that some residents are already dealing with it. ### The levee at Dardanelle, which has roughly 4,500 residents and is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) upstream from Little Rock, failed Friday when the river tore a 40-foot (12-meter) hole through it. Officials say the breach has expanded a little and the water flow has slowed a bit. ### ——— ### 9:45 a.m. ### Officials are knocking on doors in a North Little Rock, Arkansas, neighborhood and telling residents they should probably leave for higher ground due to the threat of flooding from the Arkansas River. ### Officials say in a Facebook post Saturday that they believe the river will back up storm drainage areas and cause roads to become inaccessible for possibly more than a week. ### City spokesman Nathan Hamilton says there are about 150 homes in the neighborhood covered by the evacuation recommendation. ### Officials said Friday night that a nearby city levee had been breached and the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning, but it was canceled when officials later said the levee hadn't breached and wasn't in danger of failing. Instead, a containment berm at a riverside petroleum facility had breached. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

73265,"Tweet ### Always leery of economic chaos, the editorial board of the conservative Wall Street Journal dropped the hammer on President Donald Trump for announcing escalating tariffs on Mexico for a problem the Journal said Mexico can’t solve and is not responsible for. ### Under a headline, ‘Tariff Man Unleashed,” the editors made their disgust apparent right from the start. ### “The biggest economic risk of a Donald Trump Presidency has always been that his trade obsessions would swamp the benefits of tax reform and deregulation,” they began. “For two years he has kept his worst protectionist impulses mostly in check, but as he seeks a second term we are now seeing Tariff Man unchained. Where he stops nobody knows, which is bad for the economy and perhaps his own re-election.” ### According to their analysis, the punitive tariffs should not be levied for a problem that is not of Mexico’s making. ### “The first problem here is that Mr. Trump is blaming Mexico for a mess it can’t solve. The real cause of the recent border chaos is the lure of U.S. asylum policy. Migrants from Central America know that if they cross the border illegally with children they can’t be detained for more than 20 days,” they explained. “The Mexico tariffs also heighten economic uncertainty because they aren’t even about trade. The risk is that Mr. Trump has come to view tariffs as a blunt-force tool to achieve any diplomatic goal. They are Mr. Trump’s magic elixir that will solve any political ailment … No supply chain is safe from Tariff Man.” ### Beyond the economic disruption — a major complaint of the WSJ’s editors who see a possible trade agreement going down in flames now — is the issue of the president’s diminishing “credibility” as they accuse Trump of being a big bag of wind. ### “The best scenario is that this tariff threat is Mr. Trump’s familiar bluster in which he threatens chaos to get attention and then backs down,” they wrote, before warning, “But then Tariff Man is impulsive and often his own worst enemy. Equities have fallen for six straight weeks and corporate profits are down. The job market is strong, but that isn’t guaranteed if investment starts to lag. Senate Republicans need to get off their sedan chairs and send this President a message on trade, or they may be in the minority in 2021.”",060119,1,"“ The first problem here is that Mr. Trump is blaming Mexico for a mess it can’t solve.

8418,"""We lost the road"": Highway ZZ disappearing into Fox River ### By Sarah Thomsen &nbsp|&nbsp ### Posted: Fri 5:02 PM, May 31, 2019 &nbsp|&nbsp ### Updated: Fri 7:17 PM, May 31, 2019 ### WRIGHTSTOWN, Wis. (WBAY) - We've seen a lot of problems from heavy rains and high water this spring, but what we spotted near Wrightstown Friday might be some of the most significant and long lasting impact we've seen. ### The dirt and gravel under a 100-foot section of County Highway ZZ in Wrightstown is eroding into the Fox River. The road is closed until it can be moved inland. (WBAY photo) ### A roughly 100-foot section of County Highway ZZ near Mallard Road, in southern Brown County, is simply disappearing into the Fox River. ### The shoulder of the road is gone, and the gravel and dirt that used to support the road are now falling into the water, sunken 6 to 8 feet below road level. ### Action 2 News was escorted into the closed off area by the highway department to see the costly damage. ### What we saw by land and by air, via our SkyView 2 drone, is remarkable. ### ""We had a slope failure on ZZ,"" says Paul Fontecchio, Brown County Public Works director. ""It started out as a small crack along the shoulder, and we were monitoring it. It got a little bit bigger."" ### Make that a lot bigger. ### ""We just... we lost the road,"" says Fontecchio. ### He snapped a picture April 30 when the first crack formed on the side of the road. ### May 31, that part of the earth is all but gone and crumbling right into the river. ### ""The whole slope of this road along ZZ is too steep. It's too steep. We've had consistent problems,"" says Fontecchio. ""A lot of times what happens, when you get a failure like this, you'll have a secondary failure open up into the road."" ### Fontecchio believes ZZ is one of the oldest roads in the state, placed so close to the water because it was originally meant for horses. ### While an expensive change has been needed for years, heavy rains and a consistently high river this spring paved a dangerous situation, pushing repairs and reconstruction up to this July. ### ""It's a surprise when it actually does happen. It's like, really? Not again!"" says Fontecchio. ### In order to begin repairs, crews need to reach a critical area along the bank -- but currently five feet under water, where Fontecchio says a lot of ground has likely washed away. ### They need water levels on the river to drop significantly in order to stabilize that portion of land and make a much more gradual embankment. ### It should look like another section of ZZ, just a few hundred feet to the north, when repairs are complete this fall. ### But that means the highway has to relocate. The entire road is moving more than 30 feet inland. ### ""At this location, where this failure is, the road is about 32 feet up on the hill, so it's moved over 32 feet to the east, and that will allow us to step the banks,"" explains Fontecchio. ""I know residents are frustrated. We're frustrated, but you adjust, you get the money and you fix it."" ### Improving that portion of ZZ should cost roughly $1.6 million. ### A few other sections of ZZ will also need several million dollars more in repairs in the next three years. ### ZZ has been closed to traffic for safety reasons since the end of April. ### Fontecchio says drivers will notice improvements once the project is complete. ### ""If you want to go on a Sunday drive, this will be the road. It'll be curvy. It'll be pretty. It'll be along the river. But right now, it's not a good Sunday drive.""",060119,1,""" We had a slope failure on ZZ,"" says Paul Fontecchio, Brown County Public Works director.

48101,"Share Adjust Comment Print ### ALHAMBRA, Calif. — The American photographer who shot the iconic image of a man standing in front of tanks at the 1989 Tiananmen protests says it’s time for the Chinese government to come clean about the bloody events of 30 years ago. ### Jeff Widener was an Associated Press photo editor based in Bangkok when he was called in to help cover a growing student-led pro-democracy movement centred on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. ### The day after the military crushed the protests on June 3-4, Widener took the shot of an unknown man holding shopping bags facing a row of tanks. The photo of “tank man” became one of the most famous images of defiance of the 20th century. ### In an interview, Widener said he doesn’t understand why China’s leaders won’t admit to errors made and reveal the truth behind the crackdown. ### “The United States and European countries have made mistakes throughout history and they’ve reconciled those problems,” Widener told AP. ### “I think it’s time for China to move forward and just come clean on what happened, report to the family members what happened to their loved ones so that they can put this to rest,” he said. “I think that’s the right, decent thing to do.” ### The 62-year-old Californian developed a love of photography at a young age, eventually joining AP as Southeast Asia picture editor. ### Rejected for a journalist visa at the Chinese Consulate in Bangkok, he flew to Hong Kong, where he got a tourist visa through a travel agency, and made it through customs in Beijing with a mobile darkroom in his luggage. ### With the protests in full swing, he developed a daily routine of riding a bicycle early in the morning to Tiananmen Square, where thousands of students were camped out. ### His May 30, 1989, photo captured the “Goddess of Democracy,” the students’ version of the Statue of Liberty, facing the portrait of Communist China’s first leader, Mao Zedong, on the massive Tiananmen gate. ### “So you had this democracy facing off with Communism that was quite striking,” Widener said. ### Soon, the mood began to change. After the government declared martial law, Beijing residents blocked roads to prevent troops — at that time unarmed — from moving toward the square. ### That enraged party elders led by China’s paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, steeling their determination to end the protests by military means. ### On the night of June 3, Widener rode to the square with AP reporter Dan Biers, just as the People’s Liberation Army began fighting its way eastward through barricades and crowds of protesters. ### He suffered a serious head injury from a flying piece of asphalt, but made it back to the AP bureau and his hotel. ### Widener emerged the following afternoon to find rock-strewn streets, burnt-out vehicles and a population dazed by the violence deployed against them by the government. ### Asked to get a shot of military forces occupying the square, Widener headed to the Beijing Hotel, which had vantage points close to the action, even as gunfire continued to pop from parts of the city. ### There, he met an American college exchange student, Kirk Martsen, who would play a key role in the tank man tale. Martsen acted as if he and Widener were old friends, allowing the photographer to slip past security men guarding the hotel entrance. ### Martsen had a room on the hotel’s sixth floor facing the street, to which he gave Widener access. The problem though, was film. Widener had run out and there was no way to go back to the AP bureau to get more. ### Martsen went hunting among the frightened tourists in the lobby, returning two hours later with a single roll that would prove crucial in the events that followed. ### Widener stayed overnight, and early on June 5, he rushed to the balcony upon hearing the sound of approaching tanks. ### “I started to take a photograph and a guy walks out with shopping bags and I’m thinking to myself, ‘you know this guy’s going to mess up my photograph,” he said. “I mean it really was like I wasn’t thinking clearly.” ### “So I just watched him and waited. But they didn’t shoot him. So I thought you know I need a closer shot,” he said. ### The man moved at least twice to block the tanks and climbed on the turret of one to converse with a crew member. Eventually, he was whisked from the scene by two men in blue, whose identities, like that of the man himself, have never been revealed. ### At least five photographers as well as videographers shot the scene, but Widener’s version became by far the most famous. The photo made him a Pulitzer Prize finalist and was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential images of all time. ### ——",060119,1,"There, he met an American college exchange student, Kirk Martsen, who would play a key role in the tank man tale.

However, those charges have not been confirmed by the Allen County prosecutor's office. ### Lumpkin is being held at the Allen County Jail without bond, according to a jail spokesperson. ### A woman identified as his girlfriend is also at the jail, charged with robbery of another woman resulting in serious bodily injury, around the same time as Henderson's death about 1 a.m. Thursday. ### Sources have told The Journal Gazette that a video of the shooting is circulating on social media, although police have not commented on its existence. ### Lumpkin, 26, of the 2200 block of Holton Avenue, was identified as a person of interest Thursday after Henderson was found under the pavilion at the Chapel Oaks apartments in the 800 block of Buchanan Street. ### Police released a photo of Lumpkin shortly after the killing and then brought a SWAT team and drones to the 1400 block of Greene Street, not far from the site of the killing, believing that Lumpkin was barricaded in an apartment at Villages of Hanna. ### He managed to elude police until Friday morning, when he broke into a town house on Greene Street near the Villages of Hanna. He was detained for questioning about 10:30 a.m., according to Sofia Rosales-Scatena, Fort Wayne Police Department public information officer. ### While Lumpkin was being questioned, Tianna Nechelle Marie Howze, 28, referred to as Lumpkin's girlfriend in a probable cause affidavit, was already at the jail after being taken into custody Thursday. She was charged with robbery Friday. ### Court documents indicate that Howze, of the 1400 block of Greene Street, participated with Lumpkin in an armed robbery between midnight and 1:30 a.m., around the same time Henderson was killed. ### The robbery victim said she was arguing with her boyfriend in the 1400 block of Greene Street when Lumpkin and Howze came up on her. Lumpkin brandished and pointed a black revolver handgun at her and several other people standing near her in front of the apartments. ### When the victim complained, Lumpkin placed the muzzle of the gun against her head and told her he was going to kill her, court records said. ### “I have guys selling drugs out here and your (sic) bringing heat (a word used to refer to police),” Lumpkin told her. ### Lumpkin then pistol-whipped the woman on the left side of her head at least three times and continued to hold the victim at gunpoint while Howze punched her several times in the head. Howze is also accused of swinging a keyring lanyard and striking her in the head with it, court documents said. ### Lumpkin took her purse by force and handed it to Howze, who sorted through the purse, taking $30 in cash and a preloaded debit card worth $145.22. Howze then threw the purse on the ground, court documents said. ### Lumpkin kept the gun on her while he told her that “he ran this place and she needed to leave while he watched her go,” court documents said. ### The victim was able to pick her purse up and talk Lumpkin into letting her go back into an apartment to get the rest of her belongings. The victim locked herself in an apartment and didn't leave the building until she watched Lumpkin and Howze walk away with her money and debit card toward Chapel Oaks Apartments. ### The victim went to a hospital for treatment of a possible head injury as well as multiple scrapes, and bruises on the left side of her face and head.

40515,"School merger policy so unfair to kids | Bangkok Post: opinion ### 4 comments ### - + ### Finally, the Office of Basic Education Commission (Obec) has reaffirmed its plan to merge or close small schools throughout the country, citing a cost-benefit analysis as a reason. ### The picturesque boathouse school in Lamphun became an inspiration thanks to the critically-acclaimed film 'Teacher's Diary', however, the reality is much different than portrayed in the movie. Post Today photo ### The confirmation was given last week by Obec's chairman Ekkachai Keesukpan, who explained the decision was based on a Ministry of Education survey which showed that half of the existing schools across the country -- about 18,000 small schools with less than 120 students -- could be shut down or merged with one another. Excluded from the merger plan were about 3,000 small schools in extremely remote areas or near the border. ### Mr Ekkachai went into detail about how the mergers were inevitable as the budget-per-head for students for small schools is much higher than for larger schools. ### One of the criteria used to decide which schools could be merged was distance. Small schools within a 6km radius of each other could be merged. The Obec chairman insisted that appropriate investment is necessary and that he did not think it would have much effect on students as they will only have to spend ""another 30 minutes to commute an additional 6km from their old school"", if theirs is unfortunately closed. ### Even if Obec has tried to remain sensitive by sparing those in remote and border regions, I have to say that I don't agree with the whole plan. Why do we always have to prioritise quantification over the quality of life and welfare? ### I would like to remind the Obec chairman of a few facts. The extra 6-kilometre distance does not apply to every student. Undoubtedly, some will have to travel more than 6km depending on the distance between their home and their old school. More importantly, transport in the provinces, as we all know, is a far cry from being sufficient or efficient. This means these young students will have to suffer an additional ordeal every day. ### The idea of rating those small schools as so ""unimportant"" that they could be closed down reminds me of Ban Kor Jadsan School -- Ruen Phae, which is a boathouse school in the northern province of Lamphun. I visited the school a few years ago. ### The school became well-known thanks to the critically acclaimed Thai film Teacher's Diary, which is based in a floating school in a faraway land. Due to rave reviews and its popularity, Bollywood is producing a remake that will hit theatres soon. ### The film, with picturesque scenery, may give the wrong idea to audiences about the floating school or in some cases even romanticise the rough conditions. The actual school, made from two shabby boathouses, in the middle of nowhere on the Ping River between Tak and Lamphun is nowhere near what audiences sees depicted in that movie, which was shot in the touristic Kaeng Krachan reservoir in Phetchaburi. ### In reality, these shabby boathouses serve as a boarding school where two teachers (at the time of my visit, one was away for a meeting in town) take care of six to 10 students, whose parents are fisherfolk. ### From a middle-class perspective, the quiet, faraway place seems idyllic for ""re-charging"" their batteries. But imagine yourself living in a boathouse in the middle of nowhere without electricity or facilities such as a toilet.

Some classes are actually pre-recorded classes kept on a pile of DVDs. It's absurd and unbelievable that the state leaves the issue of education and welfare for these children at the mercy of big conglomerates, which run charities to promote their image and businesses. ### Of course, this boathouse school isn't on Obec's merger target list. However, it can provide an idea of how small schools can be important for children. Obec should make education planners rethink how to design a curriculum that is more relevant for each region, provide sufficient tools and necessities so that children can attend classes in a better environment as the state aggressively touts ""Thailand 4.0"". ### It's absurd that the government puts so much weight on quantification and sees the matter as a ""loss in investment"", forgetting that education is a basic human right which will actually help people improve children's quality of life. ### Sirinya Wattanasukchai is a columnist, Bangkok Post. ### TAGS ### Do you like the content of this article? ### Like dislike 46 liked & 1 people disliked it ### Share this article",060119,1,"Unable to afford a trip to the city for school, these children have to depend on the shabby boathouse where they learn how to read and write and gain other knowledge about life outside their world of fishing.###The school relies on electricity from solar panels, installed by a company as its CSR project.

Email or tweet @collinsadam ### LIVE Updated ### Australia’s Pat Cummins is congratulated by teammates after bowling Afghanistan’s Mujib Ur Rahman. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian ### Adam Collins (at Bristol County Ground) Sam Perry (earlier) ### Sat 1 Jun 2019 12.07 EDT ### First published on Sat 1 Jun 2019 07.47 EDT ### 12:07 ### 1st over: Australia 10-0 (Finch 9, Warner 1) Target 208 Yep, they’re going to tuck in quickly alright. Finch is off the mark with a single to square leg then Warner does likewise with one in the same direction from his first ball back in the big time. Finch again, who goes crunch through cover then wallop over the circle a fraction straighter for a pair of boundaries. “There was an attempt to get a boo going,” notes Graeme Swann on TMS of Warner’s arrival. “But not many people joined in.” ### 12:04 ### The players are on the field! Yep, Warner copped a chorus of boos from the western stand, but I sense that’s because this is what they are expected to do? Anyway enough of that for now: Finch is on strike, the finger spinner Mujeeb has the ball in his hand. PLAY! ### 12:02 ### Adam Collins ### Thank you, Sam. Nicely done. That was quite a lot of fun towards the end, Afghanistan piling on 41 runs in 20 balls for their final two wickets. Rashid Khan, who was very much Blur over Oasis during the Britpop War, makes my heart swell. More to the point, the Afghanistan fans to my right at cow corner was giving it huge, well supported by neutral fans who would love to see them defend 207. ### The best bit was when they engineered a flag conga line of sorts during the second drinks break, sprinting from one length to the other, leaping over any hurdle in their way. That’s the passion we’re here for in this World Cup. They were also the first team to show some real fight, adding 130 after falling to 77/5 when it looked like everyone would be safely in the pub in time for the Champions League final. ### And look, maybe that still will be the case with Australian bound to attack this chase with Net Run Rate in mind, given that’s exactly what West Indies and New Zealand have in their modest chases. We know that it will be Warner not Khawaja who partners with the captain Finch when they return in a few minutes from now - his first competitive international innings since you-know-what. Smith will do likewise at four (after Khawaja). ### There will be some booing, I’m sure, but not much. Indeed, when Warner went to the boundary rope when Zampa was operating, there was a queue five deep for selfies and autographs. Likewise, when Smith nailed a crazy run out, there was genuine applause. My point: it’s a pretty chilled out and happy afternoon here in Bristol. The perfect setting, let’s hope, for a tricky little chase. ### 10:59 ### 31st over: Afghanistan 143-5 (Naib 24, Najibullah 42) ### Two more boundaries for the Afghani’s, this time from Starc’s bowling. Again an effort to knock over some middle-lower order batting with pace, again it comes unstuck. Starc was first helped around the corner for a boundary from Najibullah’s blade, before Naib swiped one over mid on to finish the over. Onwards, Afghanistan! ### Looks like the Afghani crowd are loving it - as you would. ### Adam Collins (@collinsadam) ### Back to back sixes from Najibullah and the Afghanistan cheersquad are giving it big. They’re now running the length of the ground with their flags at drinks. Great supporters. 134/5 (30). #CWC19 pic.twitter.com/mX4TWr3b5a ### 10:46 ### 30th over: Afghanistan 134-5 (Naib 20, Najibullah 37) ### So the fifty run partnership came up last over, at a run a ball. A 22-run over will help that cause, I’d venture. Suspect Zampa will be given a rest now. Coulter-Nile continues here, conceding an inside-edged one after Naib tried to put him in the stands, and then a wide, before another one is conceded through overthrows. ### Naib then swings one to deep midwicket for two, and suddenly this is getting quite entertaining. It’s only five from the over, but there’s clear intent from these two. Can they get 250? ### Drinks ### 10:26 ### 25th over: Afghanistan 98-5 (Naib 15, Najibullah 7) ### Oooh, yes. Najibullah reverse brooms Zampa hard behind square for a boundary - probably the most satisfying shot of the day. He then hoicks him with similar intent, but far less precision, and gets one. A productive over though - seven from it - before Zampa finishes. ### A great insight from Peter Salmon here: ### Hi Sam, ### Only played each other twice but worth noting the big role Afghanistan has played in Oz history, building the a fair bit if the railway from Adelaide to Darwin (hence ‘The Ghan’) and introducing the first 24 camels for the Burke and Wills expedition. Now there’s 1.2 million of them, doubling every 8-9 years, making it the biggest camel population in the world. So to the Afghans, May your score increase exponentially, like a camel population in the Simpson Desert! ### Cheers ### 10:11 ### 21st over: Afghanistan 77-5 (Naib 1, Najibullah 0) ### Stoinis is straight, there’s a run-out, and it’s a wicket-maiden for Australia. There’s some talk about whether Naib burnt Nabi there - I don’t think so. Think it was just very good fielding from Smith. I mean, as striker, you really shouldn’t commit until the ball is through the ring - Nabi had hit is hard enough to warrant seeing whether Smith was going to get it or not. ### News Cricket (@NewsCorpCricket) ### Disaster for Afghanistan! ### Nabi is run out for just 7 - it's that man Steve Smith again, and he's mobbed by his teammates. ### 09:59 ### 19th over: Afghanistan 75-3 (Rahmat 43, Nabi 6) ### Stoinis replaces Starc, who we can confirm was back for two overs to try and pick up a wicket. Australia will now settle into their middle overs combinations, presumably. Can’t say it will overly threaten other sides. Afghanistan are happy to retain wickets, Australia now happy to contain runs. Two from the over. Singles. ### Nice shot from Adam Collins (who will steward the OBO second innings), picking up Zampa’s wrong-un. ### Adam Collins (@collinsadam) ### Very clever bowling from Zampa to Hashmatullah. Set him up with this wrong’un, which he played for again when running down the track later in the over then didn’t adjust in time.

37768,"Associated Press ### CATANIA, Sicily (AP) — Mount Etna, Europe’s most active volcano, is spewing ash and lava once again, but officials say the activity is taking place at its summit and does not pose a risk to people. ### Etna began a new phase of eruptions on Thursday as new cracks in the volcano opened up, sending lava down its flank. ### The volcano previously erupted in December and sparked minor earthquakes that caused extensive damage to buildings in the vicinity. ### Eugenio Privitera, the director in Catania of Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, says this eruption is taking place at the summit. He says it does not pose risks to local people but visitors to Etna will need to be kept away from the summit for their own safety. ### Etna is a popular tourist destination and its eruptions, especially when seen at night, are spectacular to watch. ### Privitera says this new active phase could be over quickly or it could go on for months. ### The Italian news agency ANSA says the volcano’s activity has not yet caused problems for the nearby airport at the Sicilian city of Catania. ### (Copyright (c) 2019 The Associated Press.

92701,"Former Irish army officers speak out over 'low morale' ### By Ciarán Dunbar BBC News NI ### 1 June 2019 ### These are external links and will open in a new window ### Close share panel ### Image copyright Irish Defence Forces/Óglaigh na hÉireann ### Image caption Ireland has about 8,850 full-time military personnel ### The Republic of Ireland's military is facing a recruitment crisis as soldiers opt for a more prosperous civilian life, former officers have claimed. ### Retired officers have broken with convention and are speaking out about current problems in the ranks. ### The Irish Defence Forces are now about 650 members under strength. ### The Department of Defence said that the issue of low pay is being addressed and that a recruitment drive is under way. ### A combination of factors is causing an ""infectious lowering of morale"", one retired officer said. ### Former army commandant Frank Reidy, now a defence analyst, told the BBC that it was unprecedented for former officers to speak out in this way. ### Image copyright Irish Defence Forces/Óglaigh na hÉireann ### Image caption Ireland operates a small air corps, based in Dublin ### Pointing out that retired personnel get their information from their former colleagues, he said that he had never heard of morale being so low. ### The starting pay, inclusive of military service allowance, for a newly-qualified private, from 1 January 2019 is €27,759, (£24,609) gross annual earnings. ### There is scope for further income from allowances. ### Cmdt Reidy said it was normal that the Defence Forces shrank after the Troubles came to an end and that following Ireland's economic crisis, soldiers accepted pay cuts ""as much as you can accept it"". ### But he said that as Ireland's economy has improved, the pay in the Defence Forces has fallen behind and ""when the pay falls behind, and the economy is vibrant, soldiers leave"". ### 'Skills drain' ### He said there was no shortage of well-paid work for former soldiers, some of whom are well trained and motivated. ### ""That leaves more work to be done by the people who are left… the next thing that happens is morale goes down."" ### He said that while the numbers leaving may not look huge - those leaving are proportionally more highly qualified leading a ""skills drain"". ### ""Consequently there is an infectious lowering of morale… it affects day-to-day operations, particularly overseas service."" ### Sailor's broken dream ### Growing up in Cobh, County Cork, with a view of the headquarters of the Irish Naval Service, it was natural that Ricky Parker would join up. ### He served as a communications operator for five-and-a-half years, but left the service because he did not think he could afford to look after his family if he remained. ### ""It was probably the toughest decision I have ever made,"" he said, adding that he felt he was really good at his job. ### ""I was sitting waiting for the wages increase when the workload started getting tougher and tougher... more hours for the same pay."" ### Many of his former colleagues are in the process of leaving with some of them having to pay to leave the naval service, he said. ### Ireland's minister of state at the department of defence, Paul Keogh, is effectively a junior minister - Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar is officially in charge of defence. ### But Cmdt Reidy believes that Mr Varadkar does not have a ""hands-on role"" with defence and that this ""downgrading"" has also affected morale in the services. ### Image copyright Irish Defence Forces/Óglaigh na hÉireann ### Image caption One former officer said Ireland's military is being ""ground into the dust"" ### Cmdt Reidy's comments follow a former chief of the army saying the government is treating the Defence Forces ""with contempt and disdain"". ### Retired Brigadier-General Ger Aherne said that various add-ons that made military life bearable - such as married quarters for families - have not been retained, adding that a statutory pay body is needed to review Defence Forces pay, similar to a model used in the United Kingdom. ### Image copyright RTÉ ### Image caption The Irish minister with responsibility for defence is Paul Kehoe ### Brig-Gen Aherne's comments follow another former senior officer saying Defence Force personnel were being treated with ""contempt"". ### Cathal Berry, who was deputy commander of the elite Army Ranger Wing, said career administrators who do not have any military experience are making defence and security policies. ### On Thursday, Commandant Conor King, General Secretary of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (RACO) told an Oireachtas (Irish parliamentary) committee that the turnover rate means Ireland's defence capability being ""ground into the dust"". ### The case of the rank and file ### The head of the main organisation which represents rank and file soldiers, PDFORRA (Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association) said it has long campaigned for increases to pay and allowances for enlisted personnel. ### Ger Guinan said people are leaving because its economically ""not sustainable"" to remain. ### ""In reality, the Defence Forces find themselves in the perfect storm with an ever discerning demographic of potential employees, better pay and conditions in other sectors of society and an area of employment that is tough at the best of times,"" Mr Guinan said. ### Department of Defence response ### The Irish Defence Forces announced a rolling recruitment process in March. ### A spokesperson for Ireland's Department of Defence told the BBC that the Permanent Defence Force envisages taking in 800 new recruits in 2019 and that issue of low pay is being dealt with ""in accordance with public sector pay agreements"". ### ""The focus of these agreements is weighted in favour of those on lower pay,"" the spokesperson said. ### Image copyright Irish Defence Forces/Óglaigh na hÉireann ### Image caption Ireland patrols her seas with nine ships ### The spokesperson added that the Defence Forces have a high turnover, but that is a feature of military organisations internationally and is not new given that personnel ""acquire specialist skills which are highly sought-after in the private sector"". ### ""It is the priority of the minister with responsibility for defence to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles both at home and overseas.""",060119,1,"1 June 2019###These are external links and will open in a new window###Close share panel###Image copyright Irish Defence Forces/Óglaigh na hÉireann###Image caption Ireland has about 8,850 full-time military personnel###The Republic of Ireland's military is facing a recruitment crisis as soldiers opt for a more prosperous civilian life, former officers have claimed.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]","<p>1 June 2019</p><p>These are external links and will open in a new window</p><p>Close share panel</p><p>Image copyright Irish Defence Forces/Óglaigh na hÉireann</p><p>Image caption Ireland has about 8,850 full-time military personnel</p><p>The Republic of Ireland's military is facing a recruitment crisis as soldiers opt for a more prosperous civilian life, former officers have claimed.</p>"

16252,"Shanahan to call out China over South China Sea ###  ### Print ### hello ### Acting U.S. Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, left, meets with China's Minister of National Defense Wei Fenghe during a meeting on the sidelines of the 18th International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Shangri-la Dialogue, an annual defense and security forum in Asia, in Singapore, Friday, May 31, 2019. Associated Press ### SINGAPORE -- U.S. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said he will call out China in a speech Saturday over its militarization of manmade islands in the South China Sea and broader use of coercion to advance its national interests. ### He said his broader message to the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference will emphasize what the U.S. has done to expand its commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, against the backdrop of China's growing influence and massive military buildup. ### Speaking to reporters just before he stepped into a meeting Friday with Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, Shanahan said he wants to foster a better military relationship with Beijing, but can't ignore the communist giant's military development on the manmade outposts. ### ""They argue that it's defensive, it looks like it's a bit overkill,"" said Shanahan. ""Surface-to-air missiles, long runways, I mean, seems excessive."" ### His remarks underscore America's frayed relations with China, as the Trump administration wages a trade war with Beijing, imposes sanctions on Chinese tech giant Huawei and approves a weapons sale to Taiwan, the self-ruled island the Communist mainland claims as its own territory. And they reflect America's new national defense strategy that declared great power competition with China and Russia as the nation's top priorities. ### Shanahan's speech on Saturday - his first major address on the international stage - will set the tone for U.S. military cooperation and influence in the Indo-Pacific. And listening closely will be nervous allies and partners in the region who are worried about the economic impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute and the political blowback of America's complaints about Beijing's rapid progress in hypersonic weapons, nuclear technology and space launches. ### He also will likely face fierce questions from Chinese leaders in the audience, as many U.S. defense chiefs have seen during this annual forum. On Friday, Chinese defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian was both conciliatory and challenging. ### Speaking to reporters after Wei's meeting with Shanahan, Wu noted that the U.S. has recently ""had a series of negative words and deeds"" on Taiwan issues. ### ""On the issue of safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the U.S. should not underestimate the determination of the Chinese military, will or ability,"" he said. ### But he also said Shanahan and Wei found room for agreement on the need for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and efforts to improve communication between the U.S. and China. ### In a statement after the meeting, Army Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said the 20-minute session was ""constructive and productive.""  He said the two men discussed ""ways to build military-to-military relations that reduce the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation between our nations."" ### For years, American defense secretaries have used the Shangri-La conference's podium to condemn China for its militarization of outposts in contested areas of the South China Sea and for conducting cyber espionage against U.S. technology programs. But they have balanced their criticism with calls for cooperation, stability and a rules-based order in the region. ### Shanahan told reporters Friday that the U.S. needs to do a better job describing its level of commitment to the region, including military exercises, training and other activities. ### ""I do think we have to up our game on talking about interactions,"" he said, adding that the U.S. will have a larger presence in the region for various military exercises. ""Our responsibility is to show them what we're actually doing."" ### ____ ### Associated Press writer Annabelle Liang contributed to this report. ### This article filed under:",060119,1,""" On the issue of safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the U.S. should not underestimate the determination of the Chinese military, will or ability,"" he said.###But he also said Shanahan and Wei found room for agreement on the need for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and efforts to improve communication between the U.S. and China.###In a statement after the meeting, Army Lt.

Resentment has been growing in parts of central Mexico as the flow of migrants has continued. Towns were receptive and welcoming to the first caravans last year, but more recently have felt overwhelmed. ### Marco Ugarte ### Save ### Migrant families camped in a park leave in the middle of the night as they are pushed out by Mexican immigration authorities, in Tapachula, Mexico, early Wednesday, May 29, 2019. Authorities cleared the park of camping Central American migrants and the makeshift encampment of Haitians and African migrants outside the immigration detention center near the Guatemala border. ### Marco Ugarte ### Save ### FILE- In this April 9, 2019, file photo, trucks wait to cross the border with the U.S. in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. In a surprise announcement that could compromise a major trade deal, President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he is slapping a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports to pressure the country to do more to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross the U.S. border. ### Christian Torres ### Save ### Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador says Mexico will not respond to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of coercive tariffs with desperation, but instead push for dialogue, during a press conference at the National Palace, in Mexico City, Friday, May 31, 2019. ### Ginnette Riquelme ### Save ### WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite pushback from U.S. business, Mexico and Capitol Hill, President Donald Trump is doubling down on his threat to slap a 5% tariff on Mexican imports unless America's southern neighbor cracks down on Central American migrants trying to cross the U.S. border. ### U.S. manufacturers said the tariff, set to take effect June 10, would have devastating consequences on them and American consumers. U.S. stocks tumbled on Wall Street in response to Trump's planned action. ### ""Imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico is exactly the wrong move,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is exploring legal action in response to the tariffs. ""These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border. Instead, Congress and the president need to work together to address the serious problems at the border."" ### Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador dispatched his foreign secretary to Washington to try to negotiate a solution. He said social problems are not solved with coercive measures, but also seemed convinced that Trump just needed to be informed about all the steps Mexico has taken to slow illegal migration. ### Mexico has stepped up raids on migrant caravans traveling through the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca this year. It has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more who wait endlessly for permits that would allow them to travel legally through Mexico. ### U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with his Mexican counterpart via telephone Friday, said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, who's traveling with Pompeo in Bern, Switzerland. Ortagus said the department doesn't comment on details of diplomatic conversations. ### ""We maintain an ongoing dialogue and close cooperation with Mexico on a wide range of issues, including border security efforts,"" she said. ""The United States and Mexico recognize that managing our shared border is a challenge common to both countries."" ### Administration officials told reporters in a briefing call Thursday evening that Mexico could prevent the tariffs from kicking in by securing its southern border with Guatemala, cracking down on criminal smuggling organizations, and entering into a ""safe third country agreement"" that would make it difficult for those who enter Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the U.S. ### ""We fully believe they have the ability to stop people coming in from their southern border and if they're able to do that, these tariffs will either not go into place or will be removed after they go into place,"" said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. ### Trump said the percentage will gradually increase — up to 25% — until the migration problem is remedied. ### ""Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades,"" Trump said in a tweet Friday. ""Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!"" ### Trump's decision showed the administration going to new lengths, and looking for new levers, to pressure Mexico to take action — even if those risk upending other policy priorities, like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal that is the cornerstone of Trump's legislative agenda and seen as beneficial to his reelection effort. ### Keeping the economy rolling also is critical to Trump's reelection, and business was not happy with the president's planned tariff on Mexican imports. ### ""These proposed tariffs would have devastating consequences on manufacturers in America and on American consumers,"" said Jay Timmons, chief executive officer of the National Association of Manufacturers. ""We have taken our concerns to the highest levels of the administration and strongly urge them to consider carefully the impact of this action on working families across this country."" ### ×",060119,1,Widely scattered showers or a thunderstorm this evening.

Police in Northern California have identified the man arrested after he allegedly deliberately plowed into a group of people. The Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety says 34-year-old Peoples, of Sunnyvale, Calif., was arrested Tuesday. (Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety via AP) AP ### Prosecutors filed hate-crime allegations against Army veteran Isaiah Joel Peoples in the targeted April car attack on a crowded Sunnyvale crosswalk that injured eight people, including a 13-year-old girl who remains in critical condition. ### “Prejudice is not harmless. Someone’s child is in critical condition today because of somebody’s ignorance and hatred,” Santa Clara County District Attorney Jay Rosen said in a statement Thursday morning announcing the new allegations. ### Rosen vowed that his office will hold Peoples to account “for the pain and destruction his abhorrent act has caused the eight people he struck, and our entire community.” ### Hours later, a new seven-page complaint filed at Santa Clara Hall of Justice outlined the allegations: Peoples “committed a felony that is a hate crime and attempted to commit a felony offense that is a hate crime” against the 13-year-old and her father. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to The Fresno Bee content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### Doctors were forced to remove a portion of the critically injured 13-year-old girl’s skull to relieve what prosecutors described as “severe brain swelling.” Her father and younger brother were among those injured in the alleged hate attack. Yet others were left with broken arms and legs. ### Santa Clara County prosecutors say Peoples, the 34-year-old Army veteran who was raised in Sacramento and graduated from Sacramento State, deliberately rammed the pedestrians crossing El Camino Real at Sunnyvale Avenue and targeted at least two of the group because he thought they were Muslim or Indian. ### Hate-crime allegations can be filed when a defendant targets a person or group due to their disability, gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. ### Peoples was slated to appear Thursday afternoon in Santa Clara Superior Court on the hate crime counts. He remains held without bail in Santa Clara County jail on eight counts of attempted murder plus a special circumstance of using a car to commit the crimes. ### He faces life in prison if convicted. ### Amended felony complaint against Isaiah Peoples ### Peoples, a Department of Defense auditor with no prior criminal record, had recently moved to the South Bay for his job and had joined a local Bible study group. He was said to have been on his way to the study group in his Toyota Corolla sedan when witnesses said he accelerated through the group in the crosswalk. ### Thursday’s filing had been anticipated for several weeks – Sunnyvale police Chief Pham Ngo called in the FBI soon after the violent incident, and agents launched a joint investigation with local authorities into the alleged attack. ### Early into his investigators’ probe, Ngo said evidence showed Peoples’ actions were motivated by the victims’ race “and his belief that they were of the Muslim faith,” but stopped short of calling the April attack a hate crime. Chief Assistant DA Jay Boyarsky said at the time that “very appalling and disturbing evidence” emerged that pointed to a deliberate attack. ### But Peoples’ mother in a Sacramento Bee interview after her son’s arrest said she believed Peoples blacked out behind the wheel. Leevell Peoples said her son struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder and suffered seizures and blackouts upon returning home from military duty in Iraq. ### Peoples’ attorney Chuck Smith in an interview with the Bee had said Peoples was treated at a Menlo Park Veterans Administration facility and said he had ordered VA records to look into Peoples’ medical history and “other co-occurring issues.” ### Related stories from  Fresno Bee",060119,1,"“ Prejudice is not harmless.

49621,"No, the gun culture won’t always win ### No, the gun culture won’t always win ### The political map of the country is changing. The gun lobby used to be bipartisan. John Dingell, the legendary union Democrat from Michigan, served on the NRA’s board until 1994. An avid hunter, he earned an A+ rating from the lobby for many years. He helped lead Congress the NRA’s way against gun-safety proposals after the massacres at Columbine and Virginia Tech. But as the Democratic Party has become more urban—and as the NRA has veered ever more unmistakably toward white nationalism—the gun movement’s power has become tied ever more tightly to the Republican Party’s prospects. Those are seriously dimming. Democrats won more than 300 state legislative seats in 2018. They hold a majority of state attorney generalships. Republican-leaning women who used to accept NRA gun policy as part of the conservative coalition that held down their taxes have rebelled against the coalition in the age of Trump. Women are not only voting differently, but running for office in unprecedented numbers—and even fairly conservative women have zero use for the violent politics of the gun. ### Hundreds of thousands of students have been through active-shooter drills—and their parents are angry about it. Only about one-third of U.S. parents now express confidence that their children are safe in school. The gun lobby may argue that the parents are overreacting, based on over-reading isolated incidents. That’s true, but it’s wonderfully ironic, since the case for guns is based on an even more radical misreading of data to mislead Americans into the false belief that guns in the house protect its dwellers. ### The smartphone has challenged many of the gun culture’s most cherished illusions. ### David Frum Posted at 7:15 pm on June 1, 2019 ### theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/even-after-virginia-beach-shootings-hope-looms/590857/",060119,1,"The political map of the country is changing.

This was surprising to all of us, she had a lot of potential, but she was very, very well loved and she knew it. ### “We’re trying to connect the dots from when her coworkers last saw her and Estes Park where she was found so we can get our family some closure.” ### Tags: ### May finishes as Denver’s coldest month in 24 years ### June 1, 2019 at 9:50 am ### In case you wanted some data to back up your misery, May 2019 did indeed rank among the coldest and wettest Mays on record. ### Denver weather: Warm with a chance of severe storms, large hail in the afternoon ### June 1, 2019 at 9:06 am ### Denver will reach a high of 76 degrees on Saturday, with the potential for severe storms, 60 mph winds and hail one-inch in diameter in the afternoon, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder. ### Boulder County GMO ban plan still criticized ### June 1, 2019 at 8:00 am ### Boulder County open space staff have modified proposed changes to a plan to phase out the production of genetically modified foods on thousands of acres of publicly owned cropland. ### CU Boulder researchers discover dirt molecule can ease stress ### June 1, 2019 at 6:00 am ### Everyone remembers someone who would eat dirt on the playground at recess.

Winds WNW at 5 to 10 mph. ### Updated: June 1, 2019 @ 1:03 pm ### Relocating? How to Make the Case for Keeping Your Job ### newsfeedback@fool.com (Maurie Backman) ### Save ### Sometimes, circumstances in life cause us to pick up and move. Maybe your spouse got a job in a new city. Maybe you have a family member in need who lives across the country. Or maybe you're tired of the place you've called home for the past few years and simply want to enjoy a change of pace. ### Regardless of why you're moving, one of the most stressful aspects of uprooting your life is having to deal with finding a new job. But what if there were a way to keep your existing job? These days, a number of companies are getting on board with the remote work trend, so before you rush to resign, try convincing your boss to let you keep your job from afar. Here are a few things that might sway your manager to agree. ### Image source: Getty Images. ### 1. Highlight the work you perform solo ### One reason why your manager may not want to let you work on a completely remote basis is the fear that it'll impede teamwork and disrupt an existing workflow. That's why it's important to walk your boss through the many tasks you're already doing without other people's participation. If, for example, you can show your manager that you currently spend six out of eight hours per workday, on average, doing tasks by yourself, they may be more willing to agree to a remote arrangement. ### 2. Point to your outstanding track record ### If you're fairly new to your company, or don't exactly have the best reputation at the office, then your chances of getting to keep your job after relocating may not be all that great. On the other hand, if you've been with the company for several years, have a history of strong performance reviews, and have generally carved out a good name for yourself, then your manager might realize that you can indeed be trusted to do the same job you used to do at the office in another place. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### 3. Offer to visit the office several times a year ### It's hard to maintain strong relationships with your coworkers when you never see them. Similarly, even if much of the work you're tasked with is done solo, there may come a point when your presence in the office is needed, such as when your team is collaborating on major initiatives or your input is required at important meetings . If you want to build a case for keeping your job after you relocate, offer to come into the office a few times a year, and on your own dime if needed. Your manager may be more amenable to a remote setup if you make it clear that you're willing to make that effort. ### Moving to a different city doesn't necessarily mean you'll force yourself out of a job. If you make a strong enough case to stay with your company, you may get to remain on board after all. And that, in turn, will give you one less thing to stress about in the course of your move.

The LLS mission is to cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, and improve the quality of life of patients and their families. LLS exists to find cures and ensure access to treatments for blood cancer patients. We are saving lives not someday, but today. ### LLS funds research to advance more breakthrough therapies for blood cancer patients. We are the voice for all blood cancer patients, and we are working to ensure access to treatments for all blood cancer patients. Despite progress, more than a third of blood cancer patients still do not survive five years after their diagnosis, so more funding is needed to advance research and ensure access to treatments to help save more lives. More than $1 billion has been invested in research through LLS to save the lives of blood cancer. ### TAKING STEPS TO SAVE LIVES ### Light The Night Walk is an annual evening walk that raises funds for LLS's mission: to cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, and improve the quality of life of patients and their families. ### The Light The Night Walk is a powerful and unique fundraising campaign from LLS, which brings together families, communities and companies to honor blood cancer survivors and loved ones lost to the disease. The event also shines a light on the importance of finding cures and providing access to treatments for blood cancer patients. The Walks fund treatments that are saving lives of patients today. LLS is accelerating cures by providing patient support services, advocacy for lifesaving treatments and the most promising cancer research anywhere. And it's all happening now. ### EXPERIENCE A LIGHT THE NIGHT WALK ### During the Walk, participants symbolically light the dark world of cancer by carrying illuminated lanterns to show how their lives have been affected by blood cancer: red for supporters, white for survivors, and gold for those walking in memory of a loved one lost to cancer. ### The Light The Night Walk is a family-friendly, non-competitive two-mile walk route and is accessible to all fitness levels. Participants who raise $100 or more will become a Champion for Cures and will receive: A commemorative Light The Night t-shirt, a wristband which entitles the wearer to a variety of food and refreshments that evening. And our exclusive, illuminated lantern on the night of the walk. ### Find your local walk or consider donating today. Registration is simple - call 877-LTN-WALK (877-586-9255) or click here to create a team or walk as an individual. ### Funds are raised by sending out emails (every registered walker receives his/her own online fundraising page), asking for donations, submitting matching-gift forms and holding fundraising events. We invite everyone to come and join us as we join in the effort to cure cancer and help patients. ### 2016 BAY AREA AND SILICON VALLEY LIGHT THE NIGHT WALK DATES ### Napa Valley     - September 24, 2016 at Oxbow Commons, Napa ### East Bay        - November 5, 2016 at Walnut Creek Civic Park, Walnut Creek - hosted by Jessica Castro ### San Francisco   - November 10, 2016 at AT&T Park, San Francisco - Spencer Christian ### Click here for details on the event in Silicon Valley. ### The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) is the world's largest voluntary health agency dedicated to blood cancer.

97612,"Little Poland Festival in New Britain aims to break some records this Sunday ### Written by Karla Santos ### @KarlaSantosNBH ### NEW BRITAIN - With Sunday’s temperatures expected to be about 72 degrees, the eighth annual Little Poland Festival is expected to be hotter than ever. ### That is one of the biggest changes in the 2019 Little Poland Festival when compared to other years, when the festival was scheduled to take place at the end of April. ### The Little Poland Festival will take place between 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. across Little Poland. ### But the temperatures during the festival will not be the only record-breaking feature as 1,500 people have indicated that they will be attending the festival and another 10,000 indicated they’re interested through The 2019 Little Poland Festival’s Facebook page. ### According to Darek Barcikowski, honorary Polish consul in New Britain, the festival will also break a record in the number of vendors, which is 130 for this year’s festival. ### The festival will also incorporate new entertainment options. ### “We tried to make the entertainment more lively and diverse,” Barcikowski said. “We have a couple of new bands and groups performing. There will be a lot more options for food and beverages, gifts and things of that nature.” ### The festival will have a pierogi vendor coming from Massachusetts for the first time and a Lebanese cuisine vendor also attending for the first time. ### “We have a couple of new banks and a couple of new real estate companies,” Barcikowski said. “I believe People’s United Bank will be here for the first time. We have the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America coming from Chicago for the first time. We have Polamer, they are from Chicago, they ship packages to Poland, they are coming from the first time. We have the Polish & Slavic Federal Credit Union from New York coming for the first time. We have a lot of new folks coming and what’s interesting is that they are coming from farther and farther away.” ### In addition, the festival will have an information booth. ### The festival’s theme will be in honor of the 125th anniversary of Sacred Heart Parish on Broad Street. ### “We mention it on the poster and we will mention it on the stage during the official ceremony,” Barcikowski said. “We will present the pastor of the parish with a plaque. We will say a few words about how important the parish is to the community and in addition to being a place of worship it just has so many different programs, the school and things for kids and seniors. It’s just such a pillar here in the community and I think it’s just important to recognize that the parish has been here for 125 years.” ### Msgr. Daniel J. Plocharczyk, head of the parish, said the church has seven Masses between Saturday and Sunday. ### “We average somewhere between 2,800 to 3000 people on a weekend for Mass,” he said. ### “It’s an honor obviously because we are just so happy about just the whole thing that’s going on with the 125th anniversary,” Plocharczyk said. “I mean, that’s a big accomplishment for a parish so we are very happy. We are honored that they decided that they would want to honor our parish.” ### The festival still has a need for volunteers. For volunteer opportunities, the festival’s organizers can be contacted at littlepolandfestivalnb@gmail.com or 860-223-9100.

97738,"Email ### A dead whale at the mouth of the Placer River, at the eastern end of the Turnagain Arm, near Anchorage, Alaska. The deaths of at least 60 whales along the Pacific Coast this year have scientists concerned and looking for answers. (Nat Herz /Alaska's Energy Desk) ### Cutting through a 6-inch-thick layer of blubber demands a sharp knife. ### But as veterinary pathologist Kathy Burek prepared to slice into the abdomen of a dead gray whale, many of her knives were dull. Burek  had used them two days earlier to collect samples from a different gray whale, 100 miles away. Then, another whale beached outside Anchorage, Alaska. ### ""I didn't have time. That's what our problem is right here,"" Burek said as she struggled to pull off a slab of blubber. ### As of the end of May, four dead whales had been found thus far in Alaska. But those come after at least 60 other whale deaths along the West Coast this year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That is the highest number in two decades. ### Could gray whales be an early warning sign of other things that we need to be watchful for? ### John Calambokidis, research biologist ### Scientists say more deaths are likely in Alaska, since each spring, gray whales swim 5,000 miles from Mexico to their Arctic feeding grounds. ### ""The level of strandings we've seen on the West Coast means Alaska should brace itself for probably some significantly elevated numbers of gray whale strandings,"" said John Calambokidis, a research biologist at the Washington state-based Cascadia Research Collective . ### Burek was hired by NOAA to take samples from the stranded whale outside Anchorage. The whale had been floating for nearly two weeks, and Burek wasn't planning an extensive necropsy — the animal version of an autopsy. ### ""It's just not worth the time and effort because once we get inside the abdomen — the kidneys, the liver are just going to be kind of liquefied,"" she said. ### The whale, she added, looked ""skinny."" ### Experts say it appears that many of the other gray whales died of starvation. But scientists aren't sure why. ### Reaching ""carrying capacity"" or climate change? ### Gray whales were once hunted nearly to extinction by whalers. But they were protected by the Endangered Species Act, and the eastern North Pacific population rebounded and was removed from the endangered species list in 1994. ### These days, the overall eastern North Pacific stock of gray whales is healthy and estimated at 27,000, according to NOAA. They rebounded from a similar spike in deaths in 1999 and 2000 , and scientists think it's possible they've simply reached what's called ""carrying capacity"" — the maximum number the whales' habitat can sustain. ### But researchers are also asking whether recent warming trends in the Arctic and reduced sea ice may have affected the whales' prey. ### ""We have to really be on top of: Is there any relationship to climate change? And does this link to any other factors that might be affecting other species as well?"" Calambokidis said. ""Could gray whales be an early warning sign of other things that we need to be watchful for?"" ### Each spring and fall, the whales swim on one of the longest known mammal migrations — between their winter area in Baja California, Mexico, and their summer feeding grounds in the Chukchi, Beaufort and Bering seas in the Arctic. They primarily eat tiny, shrimplike creatures called amphipods, sucking them off the ocean floor and filtering mud and seawater out through their baleen. ### The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world, and temperatures in the Bering Sea last summer were especially high — as much as 9 degrees above normal. In the previous winter, ice levels were the lowest ever recorded. ### NOAA surveys the gray whales' feeding patterns each summer. Last year's survey results are now getting scrutinized to see whether they can help explain this year's deaths, said Michael Milstein, a NOAA spokesman. ### ""The scientists that do those surveys are going back through their records and trying to understand if there was something unusual about when and where the whales were feeding,"" he said. ### A sample of abdomen muscle from a beached whale in Alaska. The sample will be tested for potential clues to the whale's death. (Nat Herz/Alaska's Energy Desk) ### Milstein said they'll be doing another survey this year, trying to determine whether more whales are competing for limited resources. Or if, for some reason, the food is less nutritious or not providing whales the energy needed to sustain them on a long migration. ### NOAA also hopes to gather information from dead whales, like the one beached outside Anchorage. Initially, Burek wasn't optimistic about the quality of samples she would get, but it turned out that the whale was in better shape than she thought. ### After cutting and peeling a swath of blubber off one side, Burek cut into the whale's abdomen, which released periodic spurts of gas and a foul smell. Internal organs slowly slid out of Burek's incision. ### ""Ooh, guess what that is — that's the kidney!"" Burek said, as she sliced into the big red mass. ""We got kidney!"" ### Burek placed tiny chunks into bags and vials — muscle, testicle, even poop. They'll be tested later, as potential clues for researchers trying to solve the mystery of why whales are dying. ### Reporter Tom Banse contributed to this story.",060119,1,"John Calambokidis, research biologist###Scientists say more deaths are likely in Alaska, since each spring, gray whales swim 5,000 miles from Mexico to their Arctic feeding grounds.###"" The level of strandings we've seen on the West Coast means Alaska should brace itself for probably some significantly elevated numbers of gray whale strandings,"" said John Calambokidis, a research biologist at the Washington state-based Cascadia Research Collective .###Burek was hired by NOAA to take samples from the stranded whale outside Anchorage.

Police in western Germany are attributing to divine intervention a speeder’s avoidance of a ticket, after a pigeon flew in front of a traffic enforcement camera at the last second. Perhaps inspired by this week’s Ascension Day national Christian holiday, Viersen police said 'the Holy Ghost must have had a plan' to help the driver. (Kreispolizeibehoerde Viersen via AP) ### Kreispolizeibehoerde Viersen ### BERLIN (AP) — Police in western Germany say divine intervention saved a speeding driver from getting a ticket, after a pigeon photobombed a traffic enforcement camera at just the right moment. ### Perhaps inspired by this week's Ascension Day national Christian holiday, Viersen police said ""the Holy Ghost must have had a plan"" to help the driver. ### Just as the radar clocked the driver at 54 km/h (33.5 mph) in a 30km/h zone and the camera flashed, the pigeon flew in front of the car, obscuring the face of the driver with its spread wings and thereby concealing the necessary evidence of who was at the wheel. ### Police say ""thanks to the feathered guardian angel,"" the driver was spared a 105 euro ($117) fine but should take it as ""a sign from above"" to slow down. ### Man bitten by rabid bat hiding between iPad and case ### SOUTH HAMPTON, N.H. (AP) — A New Hampshire man got a big surprise as he went to close up his iPad. A bat was wedged between the back of the device and its cover and bit his finger. ### Roy Syvertson, of South Hampton, tells WMUR-TV it felt like a bee sting at first. When he realized he was dealing with a bat, he pressed down on the cover to keep it from flying away. ### The 86-year-old managed to get the bat outside but later found him dead. It turned out that the bat was rabid. Syvertson went to the hospital for rabies treatments. ### When asked how the bat got into his house and iPad case last week, Syvertson had a ready-made response. ### He quipped: ""My joke of, 'He probably knew my password,' won't last forever."" ### Seattle man builds fence around car-share vehicle at duplex ### This undated photo provided by KOMO News shows a car-share vehicle parked at a Seattle duplex.

By the next day he had erected the barricade, preventing other customers from using the vehicle. He wants Share Now, which operates car2go, to pay storage fees. The company says it won't tolerate having its vehicle held for ransom. (KOMO News via AP) ### TEL ### SEATTLE (AP) — A Seattle man took exception to a car-share vehicle that was parked without permission at his duplex. So he built a fence around it. ### Dan Smith told KIRO-TV he doesn't know who parked the car2go Mercedes May 17, but it wasn't one of his tenants. He contacted Share Now, the company that operates car2go, and gave them two hours to move the vehicle. A few hours after that, he erected the barricade, preventing other customers from using it. ### He wants the company to pay $65 a day in storage fees, $300 for the fence and up to $500 for ""harassment fees."" ### In a written statement, Share Now suggested that might amount to extortion. Spokesman Tim Krebs told The Associated Press on Thursday that the company is seeking help from the police. ### This undated photo provided by KOMO News shows a notice attached to a car-share vehicle parked at a Seattle duplex.

(KOMO News via AP) ### TEL ### ""We will not allow anyone acting with ulterior motives, including anyone attempting to extort our business by holding our property illegally, to prevent us from providing transportation to the citizens of Seattle,"" the company's statement said. ""We would like to avoid taking legal action and hope for a quick resolution."" ### The company said it has been unable to remove the sedan because of the fence. Its policy requires customers who park in unapproved areas to pay any towing and ticketing fees; repeat offenders are banned from the service. ### Smith told the AP he put up the barricade to make a point about respecting private property and because he was worried about liability if, for example, a customer became injured on his property. He said he initially tried to have the car towed, but three tow companies declined, with at least one noting that Smith had not posted signs warning that the spots were on private property and that violators could be towed. ### If the police tell him he's in the wrong, he'll cooperate, he said, because he doesn't want that much trouble. But he said he has rights to control his property, and Share Now had made no arrangements and offered no compensation to use it. ### ""I'm happy to help make Seattle a better place,"" Smith said. ### Snake slithers out of toilet, bites Florida man on arm ### CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say a ball python slithered out of a toilet and bit a South Florida man on the arm. ### Coral Springs police spokesman Chris Swinson said the man was treated at the scene after the 4-foot (1.2-meter) snake bit him when he lifted the toilet seat on Sunday morning. The snake is nonvenomous. ### Swinson told news outlets the snake didn't belong to the man and it was unclear how it got into the apartment. ### The South Florida SunSentinel reports the Coral Springs Humane Society took the snake to a veterinarian's office. It was being treated for a scale infection. ### Over the years other creatures have found their way into toilets in South Florida, including an iguana freed by Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue in March. ### Ready, aim, oops! Historic tank turns lemon-lime yellow ### This May 20, 2019 photo shows a M-41 Bulldog World War II period tank that sits at the entrance of Bluefield's Lotito City Park that was mysteriously painted a lemon-lime green color in Bluefield, W.Va. The Korean War era tank has turned bright lemon-lime yellow thanks to a mix up with paint colors. .(Eric DiNovo/The Daily Telegraph via AP) ### Eric DiNovo ### BLUEFIELD, W.Va. (AP) — A Korean War era tank owned by the West Virginia National Guard has turned bright lemon-lime yellow. The reason was a mystery until the sponsor of a science fiction club at Bluefield State College owned up to the mistake in a letter to The Bluefield Daily Telegraph . ### Jerry Conner said the U.S.S. Yeager Chapter of Starfleet International has been cleaning and painting the tank for about 20 years, and took a color sample to a local paint supplier, aiming to match the sample with two gallons of fresh paint. ### ""We were worried when we opened the containers and found something nowhere near our sample,"" Connor said in the letter. He said they painted the whole tank anyway, assuming it would turn olive drab once it dried. It didn't. ### City Manager Dane Rideout said his staff is working with the club to acquire historically accurate paint for the M41 Walker Bulldog. ### ""We want to be as historically-accurate as we can be,"" he said. ### Rideout said a copy of the receipt from the paint sold to the college club does list the color as ""tank green."" ### ""At least the yellow of the tank is a nice match for the red of our faces,"" Conner said. ### Tags",060119,1,Today###A stray shower or thunderstorm is possible early.

92016,"Bengaluru: Electric shock; 23-year-old succumbs to burn injuries ### DECCAN CHRONICLE. ### Published Jun 2, 2019, 2:58 am IST ### Updated Jun 2, 2019, 2:58 am IST ### The deceased has been identified as Satish, a native of Tamil Nadu. ### BBMP officials had granted permission for the multi-storey building and approved building plans, although the site was close to a high tension tower. ### Bengaluru: A 23-year-old construction worker, who had sustained 80 percent burn injuries after he came in contact with a high-tension wire, succumbed on Friday night, after battling for life for four days in Victoria Hospital. ### The deceased has been identified as Satish, a native of Tamil Nadu. The incident happened on May 27, when he was working at an under-construction building in Manjunath Nagar. ###  ### While Satish was at work, a high-tension wire snapped and fell on him. He sustained burn injuries and fell unconscious. ### He was immediately rushed to Victoria Hospital and admitted to the intensive care unit. ### Following Satish’s death, Basaveswara Nagar Police have registered a case and arrested the building owner, Jayakumar, and supervisor Ramachandra on Saturday. They have been booked under section 304A (causing death by negligence of the IPC). ### BBMP to be blamed? ### The under-construction building is located about 50 metres away from a high-tension tower and it was being built in violation of the norms. ### BBMP officials had, however, granted permission for the multi-storey building and even approved building plans, despite being aware that the site was located close to a high tension tower. ### Mayor Gangambike, who had visited the spot on May 28, had taken the officials to task for negligence. ### During their investigation, the police found that the building was being constructed illegally and the BBMP officials had even sent Jayakumar a notice to stop the construction. However, they did not follow it up. ### Second incident in May ### This was the second such incident to happen in May.

He struck out Berg at 122 pitches. The rule requires Enfield to leave the game at that point, but Enfield continued pitching. He threw one pitch to Carlyle Kavadas, and Penn then notified the umpires. ### Enfield was taken out of the game at that point, but he had already broken the rules. On Tuesday, the IHSAA handed down a one-game suspension for both Enfield and Brabender. ### After the game, there seemed to be some confusion about what happened. ### ""Just gotta let the umpires work,"" Enfield said. ""It's their job to ref the game. I can't say anything about it, it's up to them."" ### ""Completely confused,"" Brabender said. ""I thought 120+ meant, you know what I mean, that's my fault....that was not my interpretation of the rules.

67779,"How we think of bias at Knowhere ### By Dylan and Nathaniel, Knowhere Co-Founders ### Dear Subscriber, ### Fewer than half of Americans can name a single outlet that they believe reports the news objectively, according to a 2018 Knight Foundation study . How has trust in the quality of our public discourse arrived at such dire straits? ### America has always had partisan media outlets. Patriot newspapers viciously attacked their Loyalist contemporaries in the run-up to the American Revolution, providing space and an audience for revolutionaries including Thomas Paine . In the war’s aftermath, which left the Loyalist papers completely destroyed, divisions emerged between Federalist and Republican politicians, who each sponsored their own outlets with the specific aim of promulgating their opinions to the public. By 1850, the Census counted just 83 “neutral and independent” versus 1,630 “political” and party-funded newspapers nationwide. The norm at the time was for a town to have two papers — one dedicated to messaging from each major political party. ### The close of the 19th century brought substantial changes to the industry. A bitter war for circulation between media barons William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer cut down on overt partisanship after both realized it risked alienating half of their prospective readers. Instead, they turned to sensationalism: lurid stories of sex, scandal, and crime helped along by frightening and wildly misleading headlines became the standard replacement for political bias. Even at the time, the resulting coverage drew heavy criticism and a series of sometimes-successful libel cases. ### A 1910 political cartoon lampooning Hearst’s scandal-focused ‘yellow journalism.’ ### Nonetheless, the early 20th century saw the professionalization of the industry. A $2M gift from Pulitzer in 1912 established Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism , which has remained a top academic and research institution within the field to the present day. ### Significant professional associations including the National Press Club and the Society of Professional Journalists – along with their attendant codes of ethics – came into existence in this pre-war era. ### During the first and second World Wars, many journalists viewed propaganda as a necessary evil for maintaining morale on the home front, but the post-war period saw what some refer to as the golden age of journalism. Reporting was generally considered to be balanced and factual, although there were few outlets to choose from. Coverage of the Vietnam War, including the publication of the Pentagon Papers, and the Watergate scandal cemented perceptions of the media as a guardian against corruption and misconduct in the minds of many Americans. ### Since then, trust has steadily declined. News sources have proliferated as technology has improved, and many editorial teams have again sought to attract audiences by pushing overtly partisan narratives. The conflict reached a zenith in 2016 as then-presidential-candidate Donald Trump popularized the term “fake news” and brought it to the fore of the public consciousness. Allegations of foreign and domestic propaganda campaigns have poured more fuel on the fire, yet most Americans believe the situation is still getting worse . ### The industry needs to change. Accurate, factual information is vital to democracy. As Americans, we must work to stop the balkanization of our political discourse, and as journalists, we must maintain the professional ideals our industry has struggled towards for the past three hundred years.",060119,1,"Since then, trust has steadily declined.

That’s what No. 1 players and Grand Slam champs do, right? They raise their games at the crucial moments, they find the big serves to bail them out of trouble, they capitalize on their break points. That’s the thing, more than anything else, that makes them Slam champs in the first place. And that’s certainly what Osaka had done during her 16-match major-tournament win streak over the last 11 months. In her first two rounds at Roland Garros this week, she only began to find her form late in the second set—i.e., when she absolutely had to find it. ### Except that on Saturday, Cowan wasn’t talking about Osaka; he was talking about her opponent, 42nd-ranked Katerina Siniakova. It was the 23-year-old Czech, who had never been past the third round at a major, who was rising to the pressure-filled moments. Most prominent among them were the seven break points that Osaka earned in the first set, and that Siniakova saved. ### She saved three of them in one game, and then, serving for the set at 5-4, she came back from 0-40 to close it out. Siniakova saved them anyway she could: By scrambling, by defending, by throwing her body at the ball, by belting her roundhouse backhand, by using her drop shot. Top players enjoy, and are very good at, winning sets they probably shouldn’t have won; in this case, it was Siniakova who stole the first set and left Osaka shaking her head. ### “I was trying to get her behind the baseline as much as possible,” Siniakova said, “and trying to just put so many balls in and just don’t give her easy points. I think it was really good and it was working, and I think her serve today wasn’t so good, so I was trying to use that second serve.” ### It’s true, Osaka’s serve was off: She made just 52 percent of her first serves, and won just 48 percent of points on her second serve—that’s not a combination that makes life easy for any player. Despite serving the ball 10 miles per hour faster than Siniakova, Osaka had just one ace to the Czech’s three. Ultimately, Osaka was done in by her own inconsistency—she committed 38 unforced errors to Siniakova’s 13. Down the stretch, Osaka couldn’t keep the ball in the court long enough to let Siniakova get nervous. ### Osaka said she was tired, she had a headache, her serve and her return were off, and so was her shot selection. ### “Of course I knew I was flat,” she said. “I knew that if I stayed in the rallies on the forehand side, I would probably definitely, 99 percent of the time, win the rally. But for some reason I kept switching down the line and doing really weird stuff.” ### Osaka’s emotions seemed to be in roller-coaster mode afterward. ### First she said that, on a scale of 1 to 10, her disappointment level was “at a hundred right now.” ### Then she said, “I think me losing is probably the best thing that could have happened. I think I was over thinking, this, like calendar Slam.” (You can’t fault her for lack of ambition.) ###  ### Osaka also admitted that the expectations had taken a toll. “I just feel like there has been a weight on me, kind of. And I know that’s because everything is, like, sort of new. Like, I have played the French Open before, but not in this circumstance or situation.” ### Osaka’s loss was, more than anything, a surface-based situation; last year she beat Siniakova 6-4, 6-0 on a hard court. Osaka’s high-risk, high-reward game is suited to asphalt; on clay, her opponents can get an extra ball or two back, which means that Osaka’s risk level rises with each shot she hits. Yet this spring she made some strides, particularly with her movement, on dirt, and by the end of her presser she was looking on the bright side again. ### “If I think about it, results-wise, I think this is definitely the best clay season I’ve had,” she said. ### This was the third time Osaka has reached the third round at the French Open, but she has yet to go farther. She will. ### Related Stories",060119,1,"Osaka’s loss was, more than anything, a surface-based situation; last year she beat Siniakova 6-4, 6-0 on a hard court.

In the second half, the story continued as Boyd whiffed all alone in front of net in the 70th minute and Jozy Altidore ‘s follow-up was saved at the near post. ### Finally, the breakthrough came with six minutes to go in what appeared to be a winning moment. Drew Moor hauled down substitute Yordy Reyna blatantly in the area, and Fredy Montero delivered the 84th minute opener from the spot. The goal came on Vancouver’s first and only shot on target throughout the match, managing to put just one of its eight efforts on frame. ### Unfortunately for the hosts, that lead would not last as Toronto equalized in the final minute of regulation. Nick DeLeon fired in to Altidore at the near post, and the USMNT striker did enough to put Crepeau off and allow DeLeon’s ball to sneak through into the back of the net. It was DeLeon’s goal as Altidore was unable to get a touch, but the ball found its way through anyways. ### Game on! @TorontoFC level the game as @NickDeLeon7 's cross finds its way in. #VANvTOR pic.twitter.com/ugBYt6VdNC ### — Major League Soccer (@MLS) June 1, 2019 ### The draw left the two sides with a disappointing haul, as Toronto lept Chicago into a playoff position but could not find its way past NYCFC into sixth.

According to London-based Egyptian reporter Ahmad Yousef, the teams were not informed of the malfunction, and Wydad refused to re-take the pitch over the decision. ### With the forfeiture, Tunisian club Esperance de Tunis was crowned 2019 CAF Champions League winners, the club’s fourth continental championship. ### Astonishing scenes in the CAF Champions League final.

Other videos of fan unrest around the stadium also made their way to social media. ### The 1-1 first-leg draw in Morocco was also marred with controversy, as Egyptian referee Gehad Grisha was suspended for six months after a pair of incorrect decisions were made despite having consulted VAR. That brought Gassama into the mix to officiate the second leg. ### As a whole, the incidents are a bad look for African football less than a month before the start of the African Cup of Nations. Wydad Casablanca received widespread criticism for refusing to continue playing simply for a referee decision against the club, while VAR controversies continue to plague the CAF. Last year’s Champions League final second leg was also dealt a VAR blow when the technology malfunctioned before kickoff of the second leg, but the teams were at least informed of the situation before kickoff. That game saw Esperance win 3-0 to complete an aggregate comeback to beat Al Ahly 4-3 over the two legs. ### Faouzi Benzarti, formerly in charge of the Tunisian national team on multiple occasions, is the current manager of Wydad. It is unclear what his role was in the team’s refusal to re-take the pitch. ### Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) ### GENEVA (AP) — The Swiss supreme court has rejected an appeal by former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke against a 10-year ban from soccer for financial wrongdoing. ### The decision was published Friday , showing the 58-year-old Valcke had argued that his punishment was excessive, and that he was denied a fair trial at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Valcke was ordered to pay 18,000 Swiss francs ($17,900) in federal court costs and 20,000 Swiss francs ($19,900) to FIFA. ### FIFA said in a statement it “welcomes the Swiss Federal Tribunal judgment” on its former marketing director and top administrator. ### Valcke remains the subject of two ongoing criminal proceedings opened by Swiss federal prosecutors. A separate FIFA ethics investigation was opened in September 2016 into salaries and bonuses paid to top officials. ### The right-hand man to former FIFA president Sepp Blatter from 2007 until September 2015 had challenged a CAS ruling to uphold his FIFA ban and a fine of 100,000 Swiss francs ($99,500). ### The FIFA ethics committee charged him in relation to irregular World Cup ticket sales, expense abuses including personal use of private jets, and trying to destroy evidence. Valcke, who denies all wrongdoing, told CAS he followed advice from Blatter by taking a private flight to the 2018 World Cup qualifying draw in Russia to avoid the risk of arrest. ### The evidence emerged in fallout from sweeping investigations by American and Swiss federal prosecutors, which were revealed in May 2015. Those cases removed a generation of soccer leaders from FIFA, and from continental soccer bodies in Europe and the Americas. ### The Swiss proceedings are ongoing, and include an allegation that Valcke was bribed by Qatari television executive Nasser al-Khelaifi with the use of a luxury villa in Italy in a World Cup broadcast rights deal.

In total, Green amassed 267 Premier League appearances, keeping 55 clean sheets. ### “Following an incredible evening in Baku on Wednesday and after a 23-year career spanning three decades, I’ve decided that now is the right time to announce my retirement from professional football,” Green said in a statement via Chelsea’s official website . ### “Being part of the group and celebrations with such a special squad of players after winning the Europa League seems a fitting way to end what’s been an amazing journey for me in the game. I’ve loved every moment and feel privileged to have enjoyed the career I have. I’ve played with, and against, some of the best players in the world and have experienced so much that professional football has to offer.” ### The Three Lions veteran was most well known in the United States for making an error in the 2010 World Cup against the USMNT, allowing Clint Dempsey ‘s weak, speculative shot to clatter off his hands and into the back of the net.

But some legislators are worried certain communities are getting more out of the game than others. ### Every year, about 20% of the revenue the state lottery rakes in is distributed to the 351 towns and cities, according to the Massachusetts State Lottery's website. In 2018, the lottery returned $997 million to the state, which was the second-highest total in the commonwealth's history, a lottery statement said. ### ""The Lottery's performance is critically important to every city and town in the commonwealth,"" Treasurer Deb Goldberg, the chair of the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission, said in the 2018 statement. ""I am proud of the work the lottery team and our dedicated retail partners have done to deliver over $2 billion in essential funding for unrestricted local aid over the last two years."" ### In the past, communities have used lottery money on snow removal projects, local road improvements, school services, programs for seniors, and parks and recreation projects, according to the lottery website. ### But while all municipalities receive help, some legislators are arguing the breakdown isn't completely fair. ### Rep. Andy Vargas, D-Haverhill, said the distribution process among cities and towns — which was laid out by the state Legislature years ago — has ""produced tremendous inequities."" ### Haverhill is one of the cities that puts much more into the lottery fund than it receives, Vargas said. From 2013 to 2017, the city contributed a total of $270.3 million to the fund and got $44.1 million back — about 16% of its contribution - according to a 2018 WBUR graphic. ### Vargas drew attention to the challenge especially faced by older, mid-sized cities. ### ""I think what's important to note is that Gateway Cities like Haverhill have less of an ability to raise revenue locally because our property values aren't as high as Boston or other places across the commonwealth that can lean on property taxes to fund critical city/town services,"" Vargas wrote in an email. ### Fueled by these frustrations, Vargas — along with Rep. Antonio Cabral, D-New Bedford — filed legislation this session to create a commission to study and establish recommendations for a new local aid formula. The bill, he said, would study the distribution of general aid in Massachusetts, including that generated by lottery revenue. ### ""Specifically, the commission will study the amount of aid allocated to cities and towns, how the aid allocated matches up with the needs of the municipality, inequities across the state in regards to allocation, feasibility of accounting for changes in municipalities' tax bases when allocating aid, and alternative formulas that may produce a more equitable allocation across the state,"" Vargas wrote. ### If the bill passes, the commission would aim to complete and submit their report by March 2020, he said. ### The original formula — which according to a lottery spokeswoman was initially crafted by the Legislature in 1972 — was dependent on population numbers and property value. It hasn't been used since fiscal year 2010, according to a spokeswoman for Cabral. Still, legislators aren't happy with the current distribution process. ### Every year, each community sees the same percentage increase — usually reflective of revenue growth — in their local aid package. Theoretically, the distribution process should work, Cabral said, but it doesn't take into consideration a municipality's ability to raise revenues. It only looks at the fixed costs of the city or town, he said, making it harder on communities that can't easily raise revenue locally. ### The bill he and Vargas are proposing would change that. ### This burden to change the outdated formula falls completely on the Legislature - the Massachusetts State Lottery doesn't have any input in the distribution of local aid, the lottery spokeswoman said. The agency is required to deposit its net proceeds into the commonwealth's general fund. Local aid is then distributed to municipalities by the Department of Revenue, according to the current formula. ### ""Lottery funds are distributed as part of the Unrestricted General Government Aid, which is subject to annual appropriation,"" a DOR spokeswoman said in a statement. ### While neither the lottery nor the treasurer's office has control over the distribution formula, Emma Sands, a spokeswoman for Goldberg, said one of the goals this year is to continue emphasizing the importance of local aid. ### ""Our priority this session is focused on working with the Legislature to ensure modernization and growth of the Lottery, in order to maintain profits, stay relevant, and deliver maximum local aid dollars to communities throughout the state,"" Sands said in a statement. ### Several legislators who signed on to support the Vargas's and Cabral's bill are hoping to act fast. ### Rep. Aaron Vega, D-Holyoke, said he feels his district — which falls in another Gateway City — gets a much worse end of the bargain. ### In Holyoke, residents contributed $138.4 million to the lottery from 2013 to 2017, WBUR reported. The town received a total of $45.5 million back. ### ""There could be the argument that districts that are supporting these revenues should get a little bit more,"" Vega said. ""It should go to communities most in need."" ### But while he was happy to support Vargas's and Cabral's bill, he said he remains cautiously optimistic about the legislation. ### ""That's the right way to do things, but there's always a little bit of pessimism with that kind of process... How long will it take? Commission of who? How will it be represented?"" he said. ### Regardless, receiving more aid from the lottery would be an enormous help to his district, he said. ### ""Increased local aid for Holyoke could help us out with capital investments,"" Vega said. ""Every year, we're buying new police cars, new fire trucks ... But we have no capital accounts and it all falls on us. We have no flex in our budget to really save or plan for a rainy day or plan for some catastrophe."" ### But even the commonwealth's biggest cities — like the state capital — seem to be receiving less lottery aid than they deserve, said Rep. Russell Holmes, D-Boston. ### Boston by far contributes the most to the lottery fund — $2.7 billion between 2013 and 2017 — and received $849.6 million back. While Holmes acknowledged it was a large sum, it wasn't nearly close to the amount Boston residents were putting in. ### ""We should share with one another, but someone who's putting zero in should not get $6 million out... There should be a balance,"" Holmes said. ""They're taking the proceeds of poor cities and giving them to richer cities... All of it goes to my police, my fire, my transportation, garbage pickup. All of those dollars go into the general fund and are used to improve the lives of people in this city."" ### Related Links",060119,1,""" We should share with one another, but someone who's putting zero in should not get $6 million out...

In 98 matches thus far, the Black Caps are in front with 48 victories to Sri Lanka’s 41 with one game tied while eight were no-result verdicts. ### Since the start of 2015, New Zealand have overwhelmingly dominated Sri Lanka with 11 wins in 16 matches and just three losses with two matches concluding in no result and current form offers slim hopes for the islanders to turn the tables against a side which only reached the World Cup final in 2015, losing easily to Trans-Tasman rivals Australia. ### The reigning world champions open their 2019 campaign against Afghanistan after the two sides met just once. Their corresponding fixture four years ago was a cruel mismatch as the minnows crashed to a massive 275-run walloping at the now defunct WACA Ground in Perth on March 4. ### That day David Warner was in rampant mood with a punishing innings of 178 before Steve Smith piled further miseries with 95 and Glen Maxwell thrashed 88 from mere 39 deliveries before the Aussies finished at a commanding 417-6. Afghanistan’s response with the bat lasted 37.3 overs before they were sent packing for 142 by the fearsome pace of Mitchell Johnson (4-22). ### Coming back to New Zealand-Sri Lanka games on the biggest stage, five of the eight matches were won by team batting second, but the last two saw team successfully defending the total. ### However, the Sri Lankans are on equal footing with New Zealand in World Cup encounters over the previous 40 years with each nation winning four times; in the three mega event fixtures staged in England, New Zealand won the first two with Sri Lanka clinching their last meeting there in the return match of the 1983 tournament. ### Head-to-head summary ### June 9, 1979 — Trent Bridge, New Zealand won by nine wickets ### June 13, 1983 — Bristol, New Zealand won by five wickets ### June 18, 1983 — Derby, Sri Lanka won by three wickets ### Feb 25, 1992 — Hamilton, New Zealand won by six wickets ### Feb 10, 2003 — Bloemfontein, Sri Lanka won by 47 runs ### April 12, 2007 — St George’s, Sri Lanka won by six wickets ### March 18, 2011 — Mumbai, Sri Lanka won by 112 runs ### Feb 14, 2015 — Christchurch, New Zealand won by 98 runs. ### Published in Dawn, June 1st, 2019",060119,1,"Dear reader, online ads enable us to deliver the journalism you value.

Here are some of the best products out there invented by some kick-butt moms: ### Freemie Hands-Free Breast Pump ### Founded by a female doctor with newborn preemies, this is a hands-free breast pump that lets you walk around and do whatever you need to be doing as you're collecting breast milk. Only a mom could think up this brilliant idea! ### Aden + Anais ### Just about every mom I know has heard of this brand of wraps and blankets made from organic muslin. Mom Raegan Moya-Jones, who was raised in Australia where muslin wraps were common, introduced her first wrap in 2006, and her soft, lightweight products have been a hit with moms ever since. ### Belly Bandit ### When Lori Caden was struggling with her post-pregnancy weight, she and her sisters teamed up to create a post-pregnancy shapewear collection. The products are dedicated to making moms look and feel their best, because that is exactly what we need post-baby! ### Bare Baby Bottle ### Priska Diaz, originally from Peru, designed these bottles that feed babies air-free milk while in an upright position, allowing babies to control the flow and pace of feeding. The air-free bottles reduce issues with acid reflux and have nipples that extend to mimic breastfeeding. How brilliant is that? ### Simple Wishes Hands-Free Pumping Bra ### Invented by sisters and moms who wanted to help support women as they breastfeed, these are a collection of bras that help you nurse and pump. When nursing or pumping, these bras easily adjust and pull off the breast, which is extremely helpful. ### Baby Merlin Sleep Suit ### This suit saved us when our son graduated from the swaddle but was still flailing his hands when he slept and continually woke himself up. The suit, which was created by a mother of four, positions babies so their arms are gently weighted down — and it also helps them sleep longer. And babies sleeping longer is everything to a mama! ### Milk Stork ### Kate Torgersen needed to go away on a four-day business trip and still get her breastmilk to her babies, so she came up with the idea for the Milk Stork. It's a delivery service for busy, traveling moms who are also breastfeeding. ### Nanobebe ### Alright, this one was invented by a dad, but they count too! This bottle feeds breastmilk out of the bottle without killing its nutrients. The dad came up with the idea in the middle of the night when his son was hungry and he couldn't heat the breastmilk he had fast enough without damaging its properties. ### Tantrum Fix ### A mom of two created a portable kit when you're out and about to help you deal with tantrums in a respectful way. It includes things like a book to teach your child about emotions, a step-by-step plan method book for you, a time out bottle, a puzzle and bubbles.

Winds WNW at 10 to 15 mph. ### Updated: June 1, 2019 @ 6:03 pm ### WSP pulled over vehicle registered to Brian Butts days after shooting ### Cody Neuenschwander The Chronicle ### Save ### The investigation into the shooting death of Cowlitz County Deputy Justin DeRosier reached Lewis County in the days after the April 13 incident, when a man driving a vehicle registered to the suspected killer was pulled over on Interstate 5. ### The vehicle’s driver, Jason T. Lilienthal, 40, of Longview has been in the Lewis County Jail since his arrest on April 19 pending resolution of charges of possession of methamphetamine. ### According to Washington State Patrol incident reports obtained by The Centralia Chronicle through a public records request, at about 6 a.m. April 19, a trooper on patrol in Lewis County clocked a northbound 1993 Honda Accord traveling 18 mph over the speed limit on Interstate 5. ### The vehicle’s tabs were expired, and the Honda was traveling erratically — as though the driver were “attempting to hide something” — as it pulled over onto the shoulder after the trooper activated his lights and sirens, according to the report. ### The vehicle continued for another mile before getting off at exit 68, according to reports. ### Lilienthal, the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle, had a suspended license and said he bought the vehicle about five to six days earlier. ### A property/evidence report from WSP listed the owner of the vehicle as Brian D. Butts, a Kalama resident whom police have accused of shooting DeRosier and who himself died in a shootout with two Kelso officers the next day. ### “Washington State Patrol communications also advised me that the vehicle was linked to the Deputy involved shooting in Cowlitz County on Saturday April 13th 2019,” the trooper wrote in the report. ### Another responding trooper wrote: “(A WSP sergeant) … was in contact with detectives that were investigating the murder and they requested that we search the vehicle for a .40 caliber magazine that was an item of interest in the investigation.” ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### Lilienthal, who had been promptly arrested for driving on a suspended license, consented to a search of the vehicle. ### “On the driver’s floorboard of the vehicle I located 2 large white crystals that I believed to be methamphetamine. Then I located another crystal under the driver’s seat along with a glass meth pipe that was wrapped in a small towel. No other contraband was located,” reads the report. ### One of the troopers noted a spilled smoothie in the car, and expressed belief that Lilienthal — who allegedly said to the trooper that he used to use meth — was trying to hide the meth crystals in the smoothie before being pulled over. ### Lilienthal, during a preliminary hearing in Lewis County Superior Court on April 22, said he had worked with Butts. ### “I didn’t know that Brian Butts was the kind of person that he is. I only worked with him. I didn’t know he shot an officer. I didn’t know that he was living that kind of life. I just bought the car from him,” Lilienthal said to Judge R.W. Buzzard during the hearing. ### He insisted he didn’t know there were drugs in the car, adding that despite his criminal history and multiple warrants for failure to appear he has been staying out of trouble. ### “I know that I have a record that goes a ways back, but I’m not trying to live that life. I have a 16-month-old daughter that I’m trying to live right for. I didn’t know the things that were in that car,” he said. ### He was granted $20,000 bail on the drug charge and $5,000 bail for the suspended license charge, but is still in custody. ### On May 17, he pleaded guilty, and a sentencing hearing is set for June 12. ### Subscribe to Daily Headlines ### Sign up!  ### Love",060119,1,"“ I didn’t know that Brian Butts was the kind of person that he is.

31392,"UK volunteers still honor US airmen, 75 years after D-Day | Centre Daily Times ### UK volunteers still honor US airmen, 75 years after D-Day ### By DANICA KIRKA Associated Press ### June 01, 2019 03:15 PM ### ORDER REPRINT → ### In this photo taken on Thursday, May 23, 2019, British D-Day veteran David Woodrow, 95, who landed at Gold beach and served in 652 squadron of the British Royal Air Force stands in the old mess hall, which during World War II served as part of Hardwick Airfield, on his family's farm near the village of Topcroft, in Suffolk, eastern England. From 1942 to 1945 more than 2 million American military personnel were stationed in the U.K., and across the country people still commemorate their sacrifice. Britain is dotted with memorials, many built and still tended by local people who honor those who died and remember the thousands of others they drank and danced and fought with. Matt Dunham AP Photo ### TOPCROFT, England ### David Woodrow, 95, raises the American flag beside a memorial on his farm in eastern England every morning, weather permitting. ### He makes sure that memorial is tip-top, too. Dedicated to the U.S. Army Air Force's 93rd Bombardment Group (Heavy), it is surrounded by irises and geraniums Woodrow planted himself. The grass is trimmed to the millimeter. The granite gleams. ### ""There's one thing for certain: If Americans hadn't come over here and went to Normandy with us in '44 and the Germans had pushed us back into the sea, we couldn't have gone back again for another two or three years,"" Woodrow, a D-Day veteran himself, said when asked why he put it there. ""By that time, Germany would have had the bomb first and they would have won the war. They would have won the war then — if Normandy had failed."" ### As the wartime allies prepare to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, people around Britain are also remembering the Americans who paved the way for the invasion, including sailors who helped keep supplies flowing across the North Atlantic and air crews that flew bombing missions over occupied Europe. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to Centre Daily Times content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### From 1942 to 1945, more than 2 million U.S. military personnel were stationed in Britain. People across the country still commemorate that friendly invasion, which bolstered the nation's defenses and gave many their first taste of America. From Portpatrick on the west coast of Scotland, where a plaque marks the site of a plane crash that killed 22 American airmen, to the Norfolk farm where Woodrow raises Old Glory, Britain is dotted with memorials to U.S. servicemen. ### Some are formal affairs funded by public money, like the Cambridge American Cemetery, which houses the remains of 3,811 war dead, and the American Air Museum a few miles away, where the silhouettes of 7,031 lost aircraft are etched into a curving wall of glass. ### But most are impromptu shrines built and tended by local people to honor those who died and to remember the thousands of others they drank and danced and fought with. ### There was no government master plan to make this happen. The memorials just sprang up organically, particularly in southeastern England, where most of the U.S. air bases were located because of the proximity to occupied Europe. ### Volunteers look after memorials in village squares, on corners of former airfields, at crash sites. Museums have been placed in former control towers. World War II memorabilia collections are preserved in pubs. ### One of these personal monuments made headlines earlier this year, when 82-year-old Tony Foulds persuaded the U.S. Air Force to stage a fly-past to honor 10 American airmen who died in a crash in the northern city of Sheffield in 1944. Foulds, who believes the pilot saved his life by steering away from a field where he was playing with other children, has tended a memorial to the airmen since 1969. ### Thousands rose at dawn in February to gaze at the fly-past. ### No surprise there, said Briton Mike Warner, who serves as informal liaison between the U.S. Air Force and local communities. ### ""These individuals fought alongside our own forces,"" he said. ### One place that decided to pay tribute is Redlingfield, a village 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of London, which built a black granite memorial to 2nd Lt. Kenneth Rongstad and the crew of a B-17 bomber that crashed into a farmhouse on Nov. 19, 1943. ### Janet Norman-Philips, 66, and other locals make sure it is scrubbed and bordered with bright pansies. ### ""People wanted to remember them,"" said Norman-Philips, who worked with American veterans to erect the monument. ""They were adopted, almost."" ### There's a reason the Americans made such an impression. Tiny rural communities, some with no running water, electricity or indoor plumbing, woke up to find construction crews pouring concrete on the flat farmland within striking distance of occupied Europe. Little Redlingfield soon had 3,000 servicemen from the Eighth Air Force as neighbors. ### The Americans brought not just bombers but stuff the locals couldn't get their hands on after years of war, like clothing, tinned fruit and candy. Local girls danced to swing music with American servicemen and the bases held Christmas parties for local children. ### It wasn't all songs and roses, though. The British were shocked by segregation in the U.S. military, and American manners — or the lack of them — sometimes clashed with the more traditional local culture. ### But once they got over the shock, the Brits and the Americans generally got along. ### James Clarey became fascinated with the story of the Americans in England as a teenager, when he found an airman's ID bracelet at a crash site near his home. He began collecting artifacts and eventually set up the 453rd Bomb Group Museum and 8th Air Force Heritage Gallery at the Old Buckenham Airfield. ### It's the sort of place where a pilot can still land a small plane, park it on the grass and sit on picnic tables out front of the cafe. Actor Jimmy Stewart was stationed here during the war, as was Walter Matthau. ### Here, surrounded by memorabilia and personal stories, one is reminded of the sheer poignancy of this D-Day, because the people who were there, the living links to a horrific conflict, are slipping away. ### ""This is kind of the twilight years for them,"" Clarey said. ""You must remember what these people did 75 years ago."" ### Woodrow, who served in the Royal Air Force during the war, landed at Normandy to scout out locations for landing zones in northern France. Soon after leaving the RAF in the early 1950s, he bought the Hardwick Airfield and built his farm on it. The sergeant's mess now houses his pigs and other wartime buildings hold a greenhouse and community hall. ### Veterans of the 93rd started trickling past in the 1960s, anxious to revisit the place they had served. By the 1970s, the flow of unannounced visitors had become a steady stream, but Woodrow always invited them in. ### When the memorial was dedicated in 1987, some 500 people came from the United States. There was, of course, a big party afterward. ### One of Woodrow's proudest possessions is a plaque that the bombers' group gave him in 1995 ""in gratitude"" to him and his wife, Jean, for providing the staging post for men who wanted to remember. ### Fewer veterans visit the memorial these days. There aren't many left. But their children do, and their grandchildren as well. ### Woodrow and his family still do what they have always done for the Americans: They open the door and say ""Welcome!""",060119,1,""" This is kind of the twilight years for them,"" Clarey said. "" You must remember what these people did 75 years ago.

17865,"NHL clears Capitals’ Kuznetsov over video showing powder ### AP ### share url email fbmsngr whatsapp sms ### WASHINGTON (AP) — The NHL said Friday it has closed its review of Capitals star Evgeny Kuznetsov and a now-deleted video on social media that appears to show him in a hotel room with lines of white powder on a table in front of him. ### NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the league interviewed Kuznetsov among its “fact-finding steps.” ### “While we certainly do not condone or endorse some of the decisions he made on the night in question, Mr. Kuznetsov’s account of the events that transpired aligns with other information we have been able to gather, and we have found no basis to question his representations with respect to what did — and what did not — occur,” Daly said. “We consider the matter formally closed.” ### The video posted on Twitter carried a message saying it was why Russia lost in the world hockey championship semifinals. It showed Kuznetsov talking to someone and lines of white powder and American dollar bills can be seen on the table. Kuznetsov does not touch anything on the table in the 22-second video. ### “While I have never taken illegal drugs in my life and career, I would like to publicly apologize to the Capitals, my teammates, our fans and everyone else for putting myself in a bad situation,” Kuznetsov said in a statement released by the team. “This was a hard lesson for me to learn.” ### The 27-year-old Kuznetsov was Washington’s leading scorer in the playoffs when it won the Stanley Cup a year ago. This season, the Russian center had 72 points in 76 games but just one goal during a first-round loss to Carolina. ### The Capitals said they met with Kuznetsov to discuss the video and are disappointed by his presence in it but accept his explanation for putting himself “in an unfortunate situation.” The team statement said the Capitals expect Kuznetsov to learn from this experience and uphold his and the organization’s standards for conduct.",060119,1,"NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the league interviewed Kuznetsov among its “fact-finding steps. ”###“While we certainly do not condone or endorse some of the decisions he made on the night in question, Mr. Kuznetsov’s account of the events that transpired aligns with other information we have been able to gather, and we have found no basis to question his representations with respect to what did — and what did not — occur,” Daly said. “ We consider the matter formally closed. ”","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]","<p>NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the league interviewed Kuznetsov among its “fact-finding steps. ”</p><p>“While we certainly do not condone or endorse some of the decisions he made on the night in question, Mr. Kuznetsov’s account of the events that transpired aligns with other information we have been able to gather, and we have found no basis to question his representations with respect to what did — and what did not — occur,” Daly said. “ We consider the matter formally closed. ”</p>"

Winds NNW at 10 to 15 mph. ### Updated: June 1, 2019 @ 6:36 pm ### Family travel five: Enlightenment through cultural celebrations ### By Lynn O'Rourke Hayes, FamilyTravel.com ### 8 hrs ago ### Historic festivals and cultural celebrations provide expansive experiences for travelers. Here are five to consider: ### ___ ### 1. Nyepi, Bali ### While many celebrate a New Year with fireworks and frivolity, the Balinese choose to cleanse the spirit, meditate and bask in silence on Nyepi, or Silent Day. On Nyepi Eve, observe local villagers as they play music, dance and parade colorful, hand-crafted ""monster dolls"" through the streets, while encouraging evil spirits to join the party, hoping they will then sleep through Nyepi. During the 24 hours of silence that follows, Bali's airport, seaports, roads and all businesses are closed, steeping the island in a magical, pristine quiet. Lighting and the use of electricity are kept to a minimum and visitors and resort guests are encouraged to join islanders in a day of relaxation and reflection. It's an ideal time for journaling, napping, quiet conversation, candle-lit dinners and stargazing. Ease into the day with morning yoga at the Four Season's Jimbaran Bay's peaceful, ocean-front pavilion. At the Four Seasons Resort at Sayan guests are invited to join in a meditation under the stars aside the roof-top lotus pond. Nyepi falls according to the lunar-based Balinese calendar and thus changes each year. The next Silent Day is March 25, 2020. ### ___ ### 2. Nadaam Festival, Mongolia ### A sophisticated and elegant expression of nomadic culture, the Nadaam festival is popular among Mongols and believed to have existed for centuries. The core of the festival is comprised of ""Danshig games"" - wrestling, horse racing and archery - once reserved only for men. Today, women and girls participate in some aspects. With spiritual roots - both shamanist and Buddhist - the festival celebrates cultural identity with art, singing, dancing and ceremonies throughout the region in mid-summer. ### ___ ### 3. Heiva, Tahiti ### The 137-year old Celebration of Life, an annual, monthlong festival of Polynesian song and dance, gets underway each July. Singers and dance troupes from 118 Tahitian islands gather for an annual competition highlighting ancestral traditions and legends. Live music accompanies the contenders, using traditional instruments such as the nasal flute or ""vivo,"" marine shells or ""pu,"" and more recently, the ukulele. With meaningful choreography and costumes, it's considered the centerpiece of the festival. Visitors can also take in traditional sports and games based on ancient athletic activities. Expect a stone-lifting competition, a javelin-throwing event, ""va'a"" (outrigger canoe) races, a copra competition, and a fruit-carrying contest. ### × ### ___ ### 4. Longs Peak Scottish Irish Highland Festival, Estes Park, Colo. ### Jousting knights, hoisting athletes and calling bagpipes have been entertaining families for more than three decades in this scenic mountain setting. One of the nation's largest celebrations of the heritage, sounds, tastes and the arts of Scottish and Irish cultures gets underway the weekend after Labor Day. You'll be serenaded by bands - the marching kind, the rocking kind and everything in-between - hailing from Great Britain, Scotland, Ireland, Canada and the United States. Don't miss the free parade down Main Street, a colorful preview of the festival's glory. ### ___ ### 5. Obon, Japan ### Obon, a ""matsuri,"" or Japanese festival, is held each summer to honor the ancestors' spirits and to welcome them back for a brief visit with the living. A 500-year-old tradition in Japan, the festival begins as small lanterns are lit to guide the spirits home. There are offerings of food to nourish the spirits, either at household altars or at food stalls lining the streets. A most memorable sight is ""bon odori,"" the traditional dances that take place around a ""yagura"" (raised platform). Thousands wear ""yukata,"" a lighter summer kimono, dancing to the beat of the taiko drums. Many communities in the U.S. celebrate Obon. In California's Santa Maria Valley, all are welcome for a festival that includes taiko drumming, traditional dancing and bonsai and martial arts demonstrations. ### Contact: https://us.jnto.go.jp/top/index.php ; https://santamariavalley.com ### ___ ### (Lynn O'Rourke Hayes ( www.LOHayes.com ) is an author, family travel expert and enthusiastic explorer.

The deletion affects a gene desert, and the non-deleted gene closest to the microdeletion boundaries is LRFN5, which encodes a protein involved in synaptic plasticity and implicated in neuro-psychiatric disorders. LRFN5 expression was significantly decreased in the proband’s skin fibroblasts. The deleted region includes the pseudogene chr14.232.a, which is transcribed into a long non-coding RNA (lncLRFN5-10), whose levels were also significantly reduced in the proband’s fibroblasts compared to controls. Transfection of the patient’s fibroblasts with a plasmid expressing chr14.232.a significantly increased LRFN5 expression, while siRNA targeting chr14.232.a-derived lncLRFN5-10 reduced LRFN5 levels. In summary, we report on an individual with ASD carrying a microdeletion encompassing the pseudogene chr14.232.a encoding for lncLRFN5-10, which was found to affect the expression levels of the nearby, non-deleted LRFN5. This case illustrates the potential role of long non-coding RNAs in regulating expression of neighbouring genes with a functional role in ASD pathogenesis. ### Access optionsAccess options",060119,1,"We identified a 14q21.2 microdeletion in a 16-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), IQ in the lower part of normal range but high-functioning memory skills.

(AP Photo/Yong Teck Lim) ### SINGAPORE (AP) — South Korea’s Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo on Saturday fended off calls to step up pressure on North Korea after it test-fired missiles last month. ### Jeong told an annual security conference in Singapore that the tests were being investigated and a conclusion is within reach. ### “There are discussions whether or not it is a short-range ballistic missile. There is a perspective that it is a Russian Iskander missile, or it is a new tactical ballistic missile,” he said. ### “There are data that we can verify, and we are working off those data to make sure we have a verification.” ### Jeong was responding to a question on whether the tests were a violation of a military agreement between South and North Korea last September to halt acts of aggression against each other. ### He said the North was “in fact acting within the boundaries” of the agreement and tensions between their militaries “have been lowered to a significant extent.” ### “So currently the actions done by the North Korean regime have the intent to carry out the peace process through dialogue and talks. And I believe that’s the hidden intent behind the lines in terms of their missile launches.” ### Jeong called on the international community to “assure North Korea that the decision to denuclearize is indeed the right decision.” ### He said that South Korea sees humanitarian aid and the lowering of military tensions as ways “to lead North Korea into conversation and away from … the ways of the past.” ### North Korea itself has defended the launches, saying it was exercising its right to self-defense. ### The U.S. and Japan say the short-range ballistic missile tests on May 4 and 9 were a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The tests ended a pause in launches that began in late 2017, and came amid deadlocked negotiations to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons. ### Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya, who spoke at the same session on Korean security, stressed that a strict implementation of sanctions against North Korea was necessary. ### He specifically directed his comments at South Korea, China and Russia. ### “We need to enhance surveillance on a global scale while strengthening effort locally to ensure the full implementation of sanctions,” Iwaya said. ### Earlier Saturday, U.S. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan told the Shangri-La Dialogue conference that North Korea “remains an extraordinary threat” and has “neared a point where it could credibly strike regional allies, U.S. territory, and our forward-deployed forces.” ### Copyright © The Associated Press.

There are low-stakes versions of this, such as dramatically cutting your hair after a breakup, but I think I've made a lot of my bigger decisions — like getting my MBA — based on my high and low moods. It was a reasonable step for my career, but, looking back, I see I did it only because I was displeased with how my life was going and I needed a distraction. I had no interest in my MBA, but it was at least something to focus on. ### I have so many examples of doing that. And now, yet again, I feel a malaise — bored at work, getting over a breakup, weather is crummy — and the voice in my head is pushing me to make a career and location switch. Making a ""big move"" has always been my default when I feel this way. ### Am I just grasping for anything to distract me, or is it time to pull the trigger because it's what I want? ### — Bored ### Bored: It sounds like time to figure out why you’re so restless, easily bored, quick to reach for distractions. ### None of these is necessarily a bad thing; well-managed, these traits drive art, innovation, excellence. They just take some managing, given how easily they can pull you toward novelty at the expense of meaningful investment or, in your case, toward investments your heart isn’t in. Plus, sometimes decisions are just about guessing which option you’ll regret least. ### With a better understanding of your strengths, weaknesses and emotional makeup, though, you can learn to anticipate your malaise, ideally to the point where you preempt it by building novelty into significant parts of your life. Your career, your location, your taste in partners and friends, all can be healthy outlets for your natural drives. ### Toward this understanding, consider a tough inventory of your past decisions, using hindsight: ### ●Did you treat something as “what I want,” only to regret it later, or did you own your doubts going in? If the latter, then why did you overrule them? ### ●Were any “reasonable” decisions really just comfort-seeking or pain relief in disguise? Both of those are powerful motivators, and we tend to think up sensible-seeming excuses to heed them, though underlying pain usually has its say in the end. (So at the very least, wait out your post-breakup blahs.) ### ●Do you ever feel like you’re living someone else’s idea of a good life? Do you have an idea who that “someone else” is? And can you identify why that person’s (or culture’s) values swamp your own? ### This isn’t to suggest that decision-making should be easy. You can be sharply self-aware and use every best practice there is and still feel torn, still have regrets. If anything, I’m suspicious of people who don’t second-guess big moves. And envious. Alas. ### But contentment lies mostly in our willingness to inhabit — or reshape — whatever outcome our choices bring about, so if your pattern is to build things you don’t want to live in, then it’s time for your outer architect to start paying better attention to your inner client. Often, good therapy is the answer, but if you think you know already who you really are and just haven’t been ready to say it out loud, then I’m guessing now’s a good time to speak up. ### Dear Carolyn: My wife, ""Sue,"" considers our neighbor ""Pat"" her ""best"" and only good friend. Pat's relationship with her husband deteriorated significantly 12 years ago, and they remain married for convenience's sake. ### Pat visits our home regularly. My wife prepares a variety of snacks and finger foods for each visit, and Pat helps herself to our liquor cabinet. Since Pat has been visiting regularly, not once has she invited Sue to her house or brought the snacks and drinks to our house. ### Pat is not lacking for money, as she travels extensively. ### I have expressed my frustration to Sue about Pat's cheapness, but Sue repeatedly says, ""That's Pat,"" i.e. Pat is very personable (she is) and doesn't mean anything by not being considerate. ### I'm of the position that no ""good friend"" would ever take such advantage of another friend. Your thoughts and advice will be greatly appreciated. ### — Frustrated in Michigan ### Frustrated in Michigan: How about this: No good spouse would ever “repeatedly” take such a strong position against his wife’s “ ‘best’ and only good friend.” ### You’ve noticed Pat’s shortcomings and pointed them out to your wife. That’s fair. Loved ones look out for each other, and that includes flagging people who might be taking advantage. ### But when Sue demonstrated that she had heard you, and had decided Pat’s company was well worth the hosting imbalance, that was your cue to drop it. ### I won’t defend a steadfast failure to contribute, but, for what it’s worth, not inviting friends to one’s unhappy home of convenience makes abundant sense to me. ### Write to ### Carolyn Hax ### at tellme@washpost.com .

20782,"Indians again fail to make up ground after sloppy loss ### By PAUL HOYNES ### • Updated Today at 12:16 AM ### CHICAGO — Apparently the mantle of second place in the AL Central has been weighing too heavily on the Indians because Friday night they surrendered a portion of it with their worst game of the season. ### The White Sox took advantage of a season-high four Indians’ errors to move into a tie for second place with a 6-1 victory. ### The Indians and White Sox are tied at 28-29. The Indians have lost nine of their last 12 games, while the White Sox have won five straight. The last time the White Sox were in second place was April 7, 2018. ### “I don’t think we were ready to play tonight and that’s my fault,” manager Terry Francona said after the game. “I told them these guys that, that isn’t going to happen anymore. Losing is one thing, but losing the way we did is not acceptable. We need to clean that up.” ### The Indians started this trip with a cornucopia of offense in taking two out of three games from the Red Sox at Fenway Park. They countered that Friday night with a cornucopia of bad defense. The lowlight came when first baseman Carlos Santana made the Tribe’s third error of the night as two runs scored in the fourth inning for a 5-1 Chicago lead. ### Trevor Bauer, covering first as Santana ranged to his right in pursuit of Yonder Alonso’s grounder, bent at the waist and screamed in frustration as the ball rolled into the outfield. When Bauer struck out Eloy Jimenez to end the inning, he shouted so loudly it could be heard in the press box, far above first first base. ### “I thought he competed his rear end off,” said Francona. “We put him in some horrible positions from the get-go. On his line, I don’t what was earned and what wasn’t, it doesn’t matter. I thought he competed, and he pitched better than he has in a long time.” ### On Wednesday, Carlos Santana fell a single short of the cycle against Boston. On Friday, the Tribe’s infield fell an error short of going for the cycle. Santana, shortstop Francisco Lindor and third baseman Mike Freeman made errors. Second baseman Jason Kipnis escaped. ### The fourth inning was an inning of torment for the Tribe. ### Yolmer Sanchez, with Chicago leading, 2-1, opened with a single. No. 9 hitter Seby Zavala sent a pop up into short right field. Kipnis made a long run for the ball, but had it go off his glove. Right fielder Greg Allen probably had a better shot at the ball, but he was blocked from the play by Kipnis. ### Luery Garcia, with runners on first and second, bunted to Bauer. He had a chance to get Sanchez at third, but his throw was high and the bases were loaded. The official scorer ruled it a fielder’s choice and sacrifice bunt. ### Bauer struck out Yoan Moncada, but Jose Abreu hit a sacrifice fly to center to make it 3-1 as Zavala and Garcia moved up. Alonso followed with his hopper in the hole between first and second that eluded Santana’s glove for Chicago’s fourth and fifth run. ### The Indians played so poorly, it was difficult to keep track of their mistakes. ### Chicago scored twice in the third to take a 2-1 lead. The runs were fueled by Lindor’s throwing error and another misplayed pop up. ### Moncada started the inning with a bloop behind second base. Freeman came out from third base and Jake Bauers came in from left field, but the ball fell between them. After Abreu struck out, Alonso sent a hard grounder in the hole between first and second. Lindor, shifted from shortstop, made a diving stop. He got to his feet and instead of hold the ball, he made an offline throw to first as Moncada went to third and Alonso to second. They scored on Charlie Tilson’s double just inside the left field foul line. ### The Indians made two more errors in the fifth that led to Chicago’s sixth run. Freeman, making his second start of the season at third, played Tim Anderson’s grounder to the backhand side. His low throw to first got past Santana for an error. ### Anderson stole second and scored on Sanchez’s single to right. When Allen made a lollipop throw back into the infield, Sanchez went to second and Allen was charged with an error. ### In closing, here’s what the Indians did right: ### *Lindor hit his third leadoff homer of the season for a 1-0 lead. ### *Bauer (4-5, 3.87) grinded through seven innings. He allowed six runs, just two earned, on nine hits and one walk. He struck out eight. He closes the month of May at 0-4 with a 5.75 ERA in six starts. ### Covey (1-3, 4.73) went six innings for the win. In the first two games of this series, the Indians have lost Manny Banuelos and Covey. Banuelos entered Thursday’s game with a 10.80 ERA against the Indians. Covey entered with a 1-3 record against the Tribe. ### Plate umpire Paul Nauert warned both benches when Covey threw behind Roberto Perez in the fourth. He must have been anticipating that a rivalry would breakout. Nothing could be farther from the truth. ### Up next ### Right-hander Jefry Rodriguez (1-5, 4.99) will face the White Sox and RHP Ivan Nova (3-4, 6.96) at 2:10 p.m. on Saturday. SportsTime Ohio and WLKR 95.3 FM will carry the game. ### Rodriguez, making eighth start, has lost his last three starts. He will be facing the White Sox for the second time this season. Nova will be making his 12th start. He’s coming off a five-inning no-decision against the Royals and is 3-1 with a 3.18 ERA in five career starts against the Tribe. He’s faced them twice this year, going 1-0 with a 1.29 ERA (two runs in 14 innings).",060119,1,"“ I don’t think we were ready to play tonight and that’s my fault,” manager Terry Francona said after the game. “ I told them these guys that, that isn’t going to happen anymore.

Reuters ###  ### “If these trends in these behaviors continue, artificial features in the global commons could become tollbooths. Sovereignty could become the purview of the powerful,” Mr. Shanahan said. ### Mr. Shanahan’s speech on Saturday is also arguably an audition to both the world and U.S. top leaders in Congress, as his nomination for permanent secretary has still not been sent to Capitol Hill by President Donald Trump. ### And listening closely in the audience were nervous allies and partners in the region who are worried about the economic impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute and the political blowback of America’s complaints about Beijing’s rapid progress in hypersonic weapons, nuclear technology and space launches. ### Mr. Shanahan told reporters on Friday that he would use his speech to the Shangri-La Dialogue conference to criticise Beijing’s use of coercion to advance its interests. And after his remarks, during questions from the audience, he suggested that his speech was more directly critical than those of other U.S. defense secretaries in the past. ### “I won’t apologise for the way I framed some of my remarks, but we’re not going to ignore Chinese behavior,” Mr. Shanahan said. “I think in the past people have kind of tiptoed around that. It’s not about being confrontational, it’s about being open and having a dialogue.” ### “Competition does not mean conflict,” he said. “Competition is not to be feared. We should welcome it, provided that everyone plays by internationally established rules.” ### But he went on to restate America’s distrust of Huawei, the world’s No. 1 network equipment provider and second-largest smartphone maker. The U.S. claims Huawei is legally beholden to China’s ruling Communists, which could use the company’s products, including its next-generation wireless network known as 5G, for cyberespionage. ### Mr. Shanahan said Huawei is “too close to the government” of China, which has laws requiring data be shared. ### “That’s too much risk for the department,” said Mr. Shanahan. “You can’t trust that those networks are going to be protected. ### China on Friday warned that it was drawing up a list of “unreliable” foreign companies, organizations and individuals for targeting in what could signal retaliation for U.S. sanctions on Huawei. ### Much of Mr. Shanahan’s speech centered on America’s work with partners across the region. ### “The Indo-Pacific is our priority theater,” he said. “We are where we belong. We are investing in the region. We are investing in you, and with you.” ### But he also called on the Pacific nations to invest in their own futures. ### On North Korea, Mr. Shanahan said the U.S. is focused on negotiations to achieve full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, adding that the North “has neared a point where it could credibly strike regional allies, U.S. territory and our forward-deployed forces.” ### In a departure from past conferences, however, Mr. Shanahan faced little backlash from the Chinese leaders in the audience during the question-and-answer session. ### On Friday, Chinese defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian was both conciliatory and challenging. ### Speaking to reporters after Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe met with Mr. Shanahan, Mr. Wu noted that the U.S. has recently “had a series of negative words and deeds” on Taiwan issues. ### “On the issue of safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the U.S. should not underestimate the determination of the Chinese military, will or ability,” he said. ### But he also said Mr. Shanahan and Mr. Wei found room for agreement on the need for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and efforts to improve communication between the U.S. and China. ### Mr. Shanahan told reporters on Friday that the U.S. needs to do a better job of describing its level of commitment to the region, including military exercises, training and other activities. ### SUBSCRIBE TO OUR DAILY NEWSLETTER ### Submit",060119,1,"But he went on to restate America’s distrust of Huawei, the world ’s No. 1 network equipment provider and second-largest smartphone maker.

26428,"Posted on June  1, 2019  1:00AM PST 06.1.19 -  1:00AM PST ### Share on Facebook ### Share ### BFGoodrich ### “Most people take the tires on their cars for granted,” said Jay Jakupca. “You buy them, you use them, you either like them or you don’t. They make noise or they don’t, for whatever reason. We know that there’s some steel belts in there, and we know that there’s some rubber on the top, and it’s got a tread pattern. But apart from that, we don’t tend to really know much or dive into that.” ### Jakupca knows more than that; he’s an off-road tire designer for BFGoodrich. When the Digital Trends team realized that we didn’t really know nearly enough about tires, we called Jakupca and his on-road counterpart at BFGoodrich to see if we could catch a clue. ### Making Tires is Kind of Complicated ### When you think about it, an ordinary tire is an amazing piece of work. It’s soft enough that you can leave a mark in it with your fingernail, but it lasts 20,000 to 50,000 miles on your car. In the course of an average tire’s service life, it may have to work in sub-zero temperatures in a blizzard or above 150 degrees on a hot summer day. It will roll over rocks, curbs, potholes and worse, and it will keep going. To survive, a tire has to be tough enough to take a hit and flexible enough to bounce back millions of times. ### The 2020 Jeep JT Scrambler concept sporting BFGoodrich tires Jeep ### That toughness is built in when a tire is made. It starts with the twin rings that seal the tire to the wheel. Every tire is built up around those two stiff wire rings. Layers of rubber, reinforced with nylon, polyester, Kevlar or other materials go on first to create what tire makers call a carcass. Then rubber-coated layers of flexible steel wire are layered onto the outside. Each layer is attached with an adhesive. Finally, the soft rubber that makes the tread surface and the sidewall are applied and glued into place. ### Once the “green” tire is made, it goes into a mold for curing. The mold has the tread pattern on its inner face, and the tire is heated and pressurized into the mold. This action forms the tread, along with the raised writing you find on the sidewalls. When the tire comes out of the mold, it’s ready to be tested and shipped out. ### “… If you say you want to have the best mud traction there is — well, there is going to be some compromise.” ### There’s more to it than that, of course. Rubber compounds are dramatically different between winter tires, high-performance tires, truck and heavy equipment tires, and the low-rolling-resistance tires used on many hybrids and EVs to improve energy efficiency. The rubber compound used by any tire maker is a closely guarded secret; they won’t even discuss the ingredients, much less the formula. ### “It is a very elaborate and long process,” Jakupca said. “We go through many, many, compounds because different compounds will give you a couple percent in wet traction, or it can give you two percent better handling. It might not seem like much, but the compound is very crucial. You don’t want to use a summer compound on a winter tire.” ### Designing Tires is Super Complicated ### Once you’re at the point of actually making the tires, the hard work is already done. To get a closer look at the design process, we contacted Kevin Reim, Global Product Category Manager for B.F. Goodrich On-Road Products. ### “Compound, tread design, and architecture, all that gets proven through our experience in racing and helps guide us in development,” Reim declared. “But we do our traditional development process as well, where we are creating concepts, modeling them within our computer systems and then testing them, actually simulating them within our computer systems.” ### Computer simulation allows engineers like Jakupca and Reim to work through as many potential designs as needed before they have to commit to a prototype. The first step to designing a new tire is to ask questions. ### “It’s really about trying as many ideas as we can, within reason, after we’ve simulated what we want to. Then that tire goes to testing.” ### “What in particular are we trying to strive for?” Jakupca asked. “For instance, if you say you want to have the best mud traction there is. Well, there is going to be some compromise. A lot of times you might have to sacrifice noise, or you might have to sacrifice wear. For example, our BFGoodrich KM3 off-road tire is built to climb, built to conquer. So we need to be able to have mud traction, rock traction, and we also need to have this very robust sidewall.” ### “We do a lot of market-to-consumer study,” Reim said, “and we take a lot of feedback from consumers. We put the needs of the consumer as well as the needs of the market and all the regulatory requirements together in a very specific product specification, along with key targets for performance and other specs.” ### Once they know what they want, the engineers use a sophisticated virtual testing model. ### “We have simulations for traction and various elements like wet pavement,” Reim told Digital Trends. “We have some hydroplaning simulations that we run. All of these things help develop and prove out our concepts. Once we think we’ve got the ideal combination, we will build our prototype variations. It’s really about trying as many ideas as we can, within reason, after we’ve simulated what we want to. Then that tire goes to testing.” ### Real World Testing ### Testing a new tire design is methodical, repeatable, and data-driven. ### We collect all this data and we crunch that down to make decisions on our next move in the product development cycle. ### “At the point we go to testing, we’ve got a number of prototype tire variations,” Reim explained. “Then we go to our test facility in South Carolina. We’ve got a number of tracks and a number of vehicles there. The whole point is that we’re trying to simulate or replicate the conditions that these tires will be used in, and even more extreme conditions.” ### For a driving enthusiast, being a tire test driver could be the ultimate career. ### “Our test drivers are very well trained and experienced in detecting nuance between these products and giving us feedback to the various testing that we’ve requested,” Reim said. “Testing typically entails the usual wet and dry braking, noise, and comfort. But we do a lot of autocross in the wet and the dry.” So the testers are paid to autocross. Sign us up! ### In addition to human testing, there’s automated machine testing. ### “It’s very objective,” Reim stated. “Machine testing is more for durability and endurance. We collect all this data and we crunch that down to make decisions on our next move in the product development cycle. We typically go through several rounds of concept generation into prototyping and testing before we arrive at what we believe is the best product for the market. So a lot goes into every new product.” ### The Ultimate Test is Real Life ### Jakupca’s job is to make the off-road tires that will conquer the toughest races in the world, like the Baja 1000. Drivers running BFGoodrich tires have won the Baja overall 30 times. In 2018, eight of the top ten drivers in the Baja 1000 raced on BFGoodrich tires. That race is seen as the ultimate test. ### “We got some of the data from the 2016 Baja,” Jakupca said. “That information was critical to us to look at what needed to be tuned. From the off-road perspective, the Baja gave us the confidence we needed in the KM3.” ### “We’re a performance brand,” Reim insisted. “We put out products that really cater to performance seekers. Folks who really appreciate the performance that they can get out of vehicles and of course the components that fit those vehicles. So we’re involved in a number of motorsports venues for on-road development. Whether it’s carcass construction or it’s the compound for the tread or even the tread design, that nets us the know-how that it takes to produce more mass market products.” ### The Next Challenge ### Cars, trucks and SUVs are continually coming up with more torque and more horsepower, and that places an ever-increasing demand on tire makers like Jakupca and Reim. Further, it’s not just that there’s more raw torque and speed; it’s when and how that torque is applied. ### “With electric systems the torque is starting to go through the roof and we expect it to continue to go that way,” Reim told Digital Trends. “So right there we understand where we need to go with our product. We’re going to have to come up with tread designs that are more rigid to be able to handle that torque.” ### Once you understand the work that goes into your tires, it’s hard to take them for granted. Keep that in mind the next time you’re about to run over a rock or pothole. ### Editors' Recommendations",060119,1,"Jakupca’s job is to make the off-road tires that will conquer the toughest races in the world, like the Baja 1000.

SHOW MORE SHOW LESS (AP Photo/Wayne Parry) ### ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — The tagline makes the solution sound so simple: ""Gamble responsibly."" ### It's anything but for those who struggle with compulsive gambling. Instead, the footnote caps a powerful new temptation as ads for sports betting emerge in states that have recently legalized an activity once banned in most of the United States. ### Sharon, a 39-year-old homemaker, decided with her husband to move from New Jersey to New York specifically to get away from legalized sports betting, but still sees ads frequently that remind her of the tens of thousands of dollars in debt she racked up on a wagering app. ### Charlie, an information technology professional from suburban Philadelphia, says the advertisements and easy access makes wagering ""tempting as hell,"" even as his losses mounted to $400,000 as he bet online while traveling on service calls. ### They've complicated addiction recovery for Gary, a real estate agent from New Jersey who attends support group meetings and has lost nearly $2 million over a lifetime of gambling. ### ""It seems like every fourth commercial, there's one telling you how easy it is to bet on sports and make money,"" said Gary, who like other gamblers spoke to The Associated Press on condition that his full name not be used because of stigmas some people associate with unhealthy gambling. ### ""It's right in front of my eyes, and even though I've been in recovery for years and go regularly to Gamblers Anonymous meetings, it's starting to bother me,"" he said. ""I can feel it."" ### Advertising supporting the nascent sports betting industry has not drawn the same level of scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers in the U.S. as counterparts in Europe, where several countries strictly regulate or even ban gambling ads, including those for sports betting. ### One year after the U.S. Supreme Court ended an effective monopoly in Nevada, eight states have begun taking legal sports wagers. Three states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to create new markets and a handful of legislatures are still considering bills. None of the laws passed have significant restrictions for sports betting ads. ### The commercial casino industry wants to keep it that way. ### The American Gaming Association, the gambling industry's main trade group and lobbying arm, recently issued voluntary guidelines for sports betting advertising in a bid to stay ahead of possible government regulation, drawing on the experience of the liquor industry to develop self-regulations. ### ""We want to get in front of this in a way that is meaningful,"" said Sara Slane, the group's senior vice president of public affairs. ""We view the opportunity to offer sports betting on a state-by-state level as a privilege, and there needs to be responsible advertising that's tied to that."" ### Indeed, those who struggle with gambling find ads touting Super Bowl or March Madness wagers similar to beer ads tempting those with alcoholism or fast food ads enticing those with unhealthy eating habits. Though a hurdle for some, the ads are an understandable facet of expanded betting with sportsbooks chasing new customers to bet legally and leisurely, just like millions of people who visit casinos, buy lottery tickets or drink and eat without harmful consequences. ### ""There's not one commercial break it seems where you don't see one of these ads. As much as I tried to stop, there are all these incentives: a $500 free bet, we'll refund your first bet even if you lose. They're everywhere I look,"" said Sharon, who lives in a New York TV market that's a key target for advertisers of New Jersey sportsbooks. ""It's a constant reminder of my problem. It brings an incredible amount of guilt and shame for me, and yet there's still this incredible temptation that these ads make worse."" ### Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, thinks the details of gambling ads haven't been explored enough. ### ""In the U.S., if you say, 'Gamble responsibly,' you've now met the responsible gambling standard,"" Whyte said. ""It's going to be a big issue. There's heightened concern for people struggling with gambling addiction and relapse. And I don't see a lot of discussion about this."" ### Major sportsbooks all say they train their workers to spot people with potential gambling problems, offering various solutions including self-imposed betting ""timeouts"" for those who want them. In New Jersey, some money from licensing fees for sports betting fund compulsive gambling treatment programs, and ads are required by state law to mention a 1-800-GAMBLER telephone help line. Regulations in other states are relatively similar. ### ""We're always mindful of the tone and content in our advertisements,"" said Joe Asher, CEO of William Hill US. ""We are committed to doing what we can to help lead the industry in seeking to minimize the harm gambling can cause to the vulnerable."" ### European regulators haven't left that up to casinos. ### In 2018, Italy banned all gambling advertising — including on TV, radio and internet — as part of a ""dignity decree"" aimed in part at fighting gambling addiction. ### Sweden is considering similar restrictions. Under new regulations in Belgium, online casinos will be banned from advertising on television. Sports betting ads will air only after 8 p.m. and no such ads will be allowed during live sports broadcasts. ### England plans to ban all gambling-related ads and promotions during live sports starting in August. ### European gambling giant GVC Holdings said UK laws show go even further and ban ads during replays and some other sports programming. GVC, which operates several huge brands including bwin, Ladbrokes, Sportingbet and partypoker, signed a $200 million deal last year to offer sports betting and online gambling in the U.S. with MGM Resorts International. ### ""The (European) market has become swamped with these advertisements,"" said Martin Lycka, the company's director of regulatory affairs. ### Lycka said ideally, governments would set acceptable guidelines and individual companies would go farther than the minimums in policing their own ads. ### ""A balance needs to be struck,"" he said. ### In the U.S., leagues have generally had a hand in the content of their advertising; not long ago the NFL even stopped ads for Las Vegas casinos from airing nationally during the Super Bowl, a move that seems well antiquated now given the pending move of the Raiders to Sin City and a marketing and data deal between the league and Caesars Entertainment, one of the biggest gambling operators in the world. ### Scott Kaufman-Ross, head of fantasy and gaming for the NBA, said advertising for sports betting is OK ""if a fan is interested in betting and they want to bet. But if they're not interested if they're a problem gambler, they should not have it thrown in their face."" ### Bill Ordower, executive vice president of Major League Soccer, said restraint for leagues makes sense after a backlash several years ago to daily fantasy sports ads. ### ""Any game you watched you were inundated with that advertising,"" he said. ### Fantasy sports ads became such an annoyance that they even drew attention from law enforcement, with DraftKings and FanDuel settling a dispute in New York for a combined $12 million. ### For Gary, a 63-year-old real estate agent who has lost nearly $2 million gambling since his first bad bet on the Dallas Cowboys beating the Giants when he was 13, the struggle to resist advertising is made more difficult by the ease of betting online, a relatively new option in the legal gambling world outside Nevada. ### ""They make it so tempting. It's the perfect drug for compulsive gamblers,"" he said. ""They can close the bathroom door, make all their bets, not talk to a live person, and walk back out into the living room in a minute, with no one knowing."" ### John Sweeney, a professor at the University of North Carolina with backgrounds in advertising and sports communication, said questions about advertising point to a common question for gambling: Should states regulate this or is a single national standard necessary as sports betting grows? ### Sweeney said he recently received mail offers for casinos in 14 states, many with their own responsible gambling programs and policies. ### ""This is the time when all these gambling issues will be given regulatory structure,"" he said. ""There's an enormous amount at stake."" ### Whyte, from the national problem gambling council, suggests that U.S. casinos dedicate 1% of their advertising budget to messages promoting responsible gambling and help for those with problems. The French lottery plans to allocate 10% of its TV ad budget to such messages, but in most other places, there is no requirement to fund responsible gambling ads. ### The trajectory of sports betting in the U.S., once mainly an underground activity, makes it unclear whether the ads themselves are making people with gambling problems bet more on sports. ### Neva Pryor, executive director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, said calls to the state's hotline that involve sports betting are up 21% since it started last year. But most of those callers say they had been betting on sports long before it became legal. ### ""Some people are having difficulty with the ads,"" she said. ""The good thing is they all have the 800-GAMBLER number at the end. You don't see that with beer ads."" ### Charlie, the IT professional, said gambling is often easier than drinking alcohol when he finds himself alone in hotels with nothing to do. ### ""Imagine being an alcoholic sitting home on your couch and there's no beer in the house, and then there's this app that you can press and magically a beer appears,"" he said. ""That's the kind of access that's out there now and it's tempting as hell. It's really, really hard to maintain your recovery and not bet again. Everywhere you look, someone's urging you to gamble."" ### ___",060119,1,"European regulators haven't left that up to casinos.###In 2018, Italy banned all gambling advertising — including on TV, radio and internet — as part of a ""dignity decree"" aimed in part at fighting gambling addiction.###Sweden is considering similar restrictions.

Summer hasn't been quiet on TV for quite some time, but even by those standards, this deluge is an embarrassment of uneven riches. Some highlights: ### Luther (Sunday, 8/7c, BBC America): Charismatic and as rugged as ever, Idris Elba is back as John Luther, a London detective who keeps ticking after so many lickings you figure he must have Timex in his DNA. Little has changed as a garish fifth season commences in the first of four new episodes, with Luther quickly being kidnapped by a group of thugs, putting him at the mercy of gangster George Cornelius (Patrick Malahide). What he wants from Luther will come clear when a figure from his past eventually returns — more on that next week — but this violent interlude is a distraction from his grisly new case. Luther teams with a rising star of a new partner, DS Catherine Halliday (Wunmi Mosaku) — ""We're the dinosaurs, she's the meteor,"" his boss declares) — to look into a series of horrifying mutilation murders. It's all a bit much, but if it weren't, it wouldn't be Luther. ### NOS4A2  (Sunday, 10/9c, AMC): The title of Joe Hill's expansive horror novel, adapted into series form, refers to the license plate of a vintage Wraith Rolls-Royce — sound it out, it's ""Nosferatu,"" a term often associated with vampires — and there's never been a ghoul quite like Charlie Manx ( Zachary Quinto in an ever-changing parade of gruesome old-age makeups). This boogeyman lures unwitting kids into his vehicle, though it fairly screams ""don't ride with strangers,"" transporting them into a realm of his imagination — here, it's called an ""inscape"" — which he calls Christmasland. (The use of Christmas carols to build tension is rather inspired.) But NOS4A2 is really the story of working-class teen heroine Vic McQueen (Ashleigh Cummings), whose discovery of her own ""inscape"" while riding her motorbike to escape her dead-end life leads her into direct conflict with Manx. Grounding the supernatural shenanigans in the drab realism of Vic's world has its merits, but this might have made a better, and certainly more propulsive, movie than a draggy weekly series. After screening six episodes, I wanted to start asking ""Are we there yet?"" when it comes to Vic's search for the lost children in Christmasland. ### The Weekly (Sunday, 10/9c, FX): Missing your weekly 60 Minutes fix on Sundays now that TV's pre-eminent newsmagazine is on a summer break? Consider this first-rate exercise in investigative journalism, following staff members of The New York Times as they report stories and work sources to reveal often hard truths. The opener takes education reporter Erica L. Green and Justice Department reporter Katie Benner to rural Louisiana, where they expose deceptive practices at a private and unaccredited school that boasts of being able to place its students in Ivy League universities. In an illuminating vignette, Green worries about the impact on one of her sources coming forward, as she talks over the approach of the story with her editor over the phone. That's journalism in action. ### Perpetual Grace, LTD  (Sunday, 10/9c, Epix): Offbeat to a possible fault, this weirdly intriguing crime drama from the creator of Amazon's Patriot has the feel of Fargo transplanted to the land of Breaking Bad , though not initially as compelling as either. Set in rural New Mexico near the Mexican border, it's the story of a drifting grifter ( Westworld alum Jimmi Simpson ) who's enlisted to set up and bring down a swindling pastor ( Ben Kingsley ) and his wife (Jacki Weaver). Naturally, things aren't quite as they seem, and the story takes yet another sinister turn when a Texas Ranger named Walker — not Chuck Norris, but Lost 's Terry O'Quinn — enters the picture. ### American Princess (Sunday, 9/8c, Lifetime): The least of the weekend's many premieres is a peculiar new rom-com about a socialite bride (Georgia Flood) who flees her wedding and a coterie of obnoxious JAP stereotypes, finding a new home among a quirky community of Renaissance Faire employees and attendees. Spare thee this twee detour into self-amused whimsy. ### Inside Weekend TV: Following a theatrical run, Hulu presents the documentary film Ask Dr. Ruth (streaming Saturday), profiling Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the 90-year-old and still irrepressible sex therapist who looks back at her life as a Holocaust survivor and contributor to the sexual revolution… The infinitely adaptable Jane Austen has now inspired Lifetime's Pride & Prejudice: Atlanta (Saturday, 8/7c), starring Reginald VelJohnson and Jackée Harry as the Bennets, a Southern Baptist minister and his wife, desperate to marry off their five daughters. Empire 's Juan Antonio is the eligible Will Darcy whom they hope will take a shine to Lizzie (Tiffany Hines)… AMC's Fear the Walking Dead (Sunday, 10/9c) returns for a fifth season with do-gooding Team Morgan ( Lennie James ) literally crash-landing in their latest mission of mercy gone awry. Will they never learn that their fellow humans are an even worse threat than the relentless horde of zombies? ### ×",060119,1,"This is one of those weekends that defines the notion of ""peak TV,"" with so many premieres piling on top of the other it's a wonder anything is able to break out anymore.

The non-prescription cream is marketed by Green Roads of Deerfield Beach, Florida. ### MARK LENNIHAN/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ### Many unanswered questions, concerns about CBD products, says FDA acting chief at first public hearing ### By William Wan / The Washington Post ### 30 min ago ### Save ### WASHINGTON — The acting head of the Food and Drug Administration launched the agency's first hearing on CBD products Friday with a laundry of list of questions about cannabidiol, better known as CBD, which is already being sold in pills, tinctures, skin lotions, sodas and dog food. ### How much of the cannabis extract is safe to consume daily, he asked at the jam-packed, all-day hearing at FDA headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland. How will it interact with other drugs? What if a consumer is pregnant? What is CBD's effect on children? What happens if someone takes it over the course of years? ### Acting Commissioner Norman ""Ned"" Sharpless said answers to most of those questions are still unknown despite the popularity of many CBD products. ### ""There are important reasons to generally prohibit putting drugs in the food supply,"" Sharpless said. And cannabis extracts like CBD ""are no exception."" ### During the 10 hours of testimony that followed, hemp growers, start-up businesses, academic researchers and consumer advocates argued about how FDA should regulate the already booming CBD industry. Some demanded strict oversight. Others — especially companies with millions at stake — lobbied for looser regulation. ### But the common theme among them all: FDA needs to figure out its rules sooner, rather than later. ### Even though FDA's regulations make adding CBD to food and supplements illegal, the CBD industry has exploded in recent years with thousands of unproven products flooding the market. Companies have trumpeted the compound's alleged health benefits — claiming it can reduce anxiety, pain and insomnia and treat conditions from Parkinson's disease to cancer. But almost all such claims lack rigorous scientific proof, prompting concern among health officials and scientists about safety and deceptive marketing. ### Without clearly defined regulations, no one knows for sure how much CBD is in products available on the market, or how safely the chemical compound is being manufactured and incorporated into them. ### ""It's a wild West kind of environment right now,"" said Yasmin Hurd, a psychiatry professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, who has researched CBD for almost 10 years. ""I'm inundated every day with patients wanting to know how much CBD they should take, which ones to buy. But we don't know what's in the stuff now being sold. . . . We've had this explosion without guidance to the public or regulation."" ### How the FDA will choose to regulate the industry and how long it will need to figure that out remain unclear. Those prospective regulations have become a fierce battleground: More than 400 people and groups applied for a hance to speak at Friday's hearing, with roughly 120 speaking slots parsed out for the marathon hearing. ### CBD can be derived from the marijuana plant or hemp. Congress in December legalized hemp as part of the Farm Bill, clearing the way for industrial production of the nonintoxicating compound from that plant. But the FDA quickly made it clear to companies that while hemp was legal, CBD extract remained under government regulation. In recent months, the agency has sent warning letters to some companies that it said were ""illegally selling CBD products that claimed to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure serious diseases, such as cancer."" ### Billions are at stake in how the FDA decides to regulate the compound, with business analysts projecting the industry could grow to be worth as much as $22 billion in the next five years. ### Market research firm New Frontier Data estimated that sales of CBD products in the United States more than tripled between 2014 and 2017, to $367 million. ### Retailers like CVS and Walgreens have announced plans to sell CBD lotions and creams. Food and beverage companies have eagerly jumped in, too, with burger chain Carl's Jr. selling CBD-infused burgers. ### At Friday's hearing, hemp growers argued that the CBD market represented thousands of jobs and a booming source of growth for the economy.

He sang pensive ballads about social ills, and unlike most entertainers in China, he dared to broach the taboo subject of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests that ended in bloodshed on June 4, 1989. ### Ng Han Guan ### Save ### BEIJING (AP) — It has been three months since Chinese rock musician Li Zhi disappeared from public view. ### First, an upcoming tour was canceled and his social media accounts were taken down. Then his music was removed from all of China's major streaming sites — as if his career had never existed at all. ### Li is an outspoken artist who performs folk rock. He sang pensive ballads about social ills, and unlike most entertainers in China, dared to broach the taboo subject of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests that ended in bloodshed on June 4, 1989. ### ""Now this square is my grave,"" Li sang. ""Everything is just a dream."" ### China's ruling Communist Party has pushed people like Li into the shadows as it braces for Tuesday's 30th anniversary of the military crackdown. Hundreds, if not thousands, are estimated to have died on the night of June 3 and in the early hours of June 4. ### The party's effort to scrub any mention of the movement has been consistent through the decades since then and ramps up before major anniversaries every five years. This year, the trade war with the U.S. has added to government skittishness about instability. ### ""They are certainly nervous,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. ""Under (President) Xi Jinping, no stone will be left unturned."" ### Many of the actions appear aimed at eliminating any risk of individuals speaking out, however small their platforms. Bilibili, a Chinese video streaming site, announced last week that its popular real-time comments feature will be disabled until June 6 for ""system upgrades."" ### Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, said 13 people have either been detained or taken away from their homes in connection with the anniversary. Among them are several artists who recently embarked on a ""national conscience exhibit tour"" and a filmmaker who was detained after tweeting images of a liquor bottle commemorating June 4. ### The bottle's label featured a play on words using ""baijiu,"" China's signature grain alcohol, and the Chinese words for 89, or ""bajiu."" A court convicted four people involved in designing the bottle in April. ### Foreign companies are not immune. Apple Music has removed from its Chinese streaming service a song by Hong Kong singer Jackie Cheung that references the Tiananmen crackdown. Tat Ming Pair, a Hong Kong duo, have been deleted entirely from the app. They released a song this month called ""Remembering is a Crime"" in memory of the protests. ### Wikipedia also announced this month that the online encyclopedia is no longer accessible in China. While the Chinese-language version has been blocked since 2015, most other languages could previously be viewed, Wikipedia said. ### The disappearance of Li, the musician, has left fans searching for answers. ### On Feb. 20, the official Weibo social media account for the 40-year-old's concert tour posted a photograph of its team in front of a truck about to embark on scheduled performances in Sichuan province in China's southwest. ### Just two days later, however, the account posted an image of a hand wearing what appeared to be a hospital wrist band and the words: ""Very sorry."" The next post, published the same day, announced without explanation that the tour was canceled and that ticket purchasers would shortly receive a refund. Fans flooded the comment section with wishes for a speedy recovery. ### But the suggestion that a health issue was behind the cancellations was later thrown into doubt. ### A statement published in April by Sichuan's culture department said it had ""urgently halted"" concert plans for a ""well-known singer with improper conduct"" who was previously slated for 23 performances — the same number of concerts which Li had scheduled in the province. It said 18,000 tickets were fully refunded. ### Authorities in China regularly use ""improper conduct"" to describe political transgressions. ### Around the same time, Li's presence on the Chinese internet was completely erased. An April 21 central government directive ordered all websites to delete any audio or video content relating to five of Li's songs, according to China Digital Times, an organization that publishes leaked censorship instructions. ### The Associated Press could not independently verify the authenticity of the directive. ### ""There's pretty much a consensus"" among those working in the industry that Li's disappearance from public view is due to the sensitive anniversary, said a music industry professional who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fear of government retribution. ### ""He did a number of songs that were considered politically risky, making references to June 4, 1989, and so he's been out of the picture,"" the industry professional said. ### The AP could not confirm Li's current whereabouts. His company and record label did not respond to repeated interview requests. ### Li's songs alluding to the Tiananmen Square protests — ""The Square,"" ''The Spring of 1990"" and ""The Goddess,"" in honor of the Goddess of Democracy that students erected — were part of his earlier works. In recent years, the bespectacled singer has avoided making public political statements, focusing more on promoting his performances. ### In 2015, the state-run China Daily newspaper published a profile of Li, describing him as a performer who easily sells out concerts. After years of working as an independent artist, he signed last fall with Taihe Music Group, a major Chinese record label. ### Fans who knew Li as a largely apolitical entertainer expressed bewilderment online about his disappearance. Others made veiled references to China's internet censorship. ### On Zhihu, a question-and-answer website similar to Quora, one user wrote that people posed questions every day about what might have happened to Li, but these posts always disappeared the next morning ""as if nothing had happened at all."" ### Another user said, ""I don't dare to say it, nor do I dare to ask."" ### A fan who has been sharing Li's music on his personal account spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he feared his employers would punish him for discussing the subject. ### ""Everyone knows the reason for Li Zhi's disappearance,"" the fan said. ""But I'm sorry, I can't tell you, because I follow China's laws and also hope that Li Zhi can return."" Quoting one of Li's lyrics, the fan added, ""The world will be all right."" ### Fans continue to circulate videos of Li's performances online. His complete discography has been uploaded onto file-sharing websites, with back-up links in case the original ones are shuttered. Some users shared tribute art, including a black T-shirt with the words ""improper conduct."" ### A few years ago, in a performance in Taiwan, Li bounced around on stage, strumming his guitar and repeating a chorus in apparent tribute to the spirit of Chinese propaganda. ### ""The people don't need freedom,"" he sang energetically. ### ""This is the best era!"" the crowd roared back. ### ""The people don't need freedom."" ### ""This is the best era!"" ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

90196,"News - AP-National ### Blues must balance emotion, discipline at home in Cup Final ### Blues know they need to keep emotions in check in first Stanley Cup Final game in St. Louis in 49 years. ### Friday, May 31st 2019, 8:11 PM EDT ### Updated: ### Saturday, June 1st 2019, 2:52 PM EDT ### By STEPHEN WHYNO ### AP Hockey Writer ### ST. LOUIS (AP) - Tyler Bozak witnessed the first NHL playoff game in Toronto after a seven-year drought. David Perron experienced the first Stanley Cup Final game in Las Vegas. ### They ain't seen nothin' yet. ### AlertMe ### When the St. Louis Blues host the Boston Bruins in Game 3 on Saturday night, it'll mark the first Stanley Cup Final game in the city in 49 years. That was May 5, 1970, a 6-2 loss to the Bruins in Game 2 of the series that Bobby Orr ended in four games with an overtime goal. ### After winning a final game for the first time in franchise history to tie the series at 1-all, the Blues are trying to make their own history at home. To do so, the least-penalized team in the playoffs that went to the box 10 times in the two games in Boston will need to balance feeding off a raucous crowd and getting too overemotional in that charged atmosphere. ### ""It's going to be extremely special, for sure, to play in front of the Blues fans that have been waiting for it for a long time,"" Perron said Friday. ""You're trying to keep your sticks close to you so you don't trip guys, you don't high-stick guys and sometimes it's just going to happen. It's not a penalty you're trying to take. It happened to me in the first game, and it's very difficult to take. But you've got to be composed with the puck, you've got to be composed with your stick."" ### Composure is the Blues' calling card after rallying from the basement of the NHL standings in early January to within three victories of the first championship in franchise history. Their home arena was full for viewing parties for Games 1 and 2, so it's tough for players not to get caught up in the excitement after watching videos of those scenes. ### ""We're not even here and it's sold out and it's loud,"" Bozak said. ""We're excited."" ### Fans are certainly excited. NBC Sports reported the highest local rating on cable for a playoff game, StubHub said the price to get in is $725, the average ticket costs $1,068 and demand is outpacing Game 1 in Las Vegas from a year ago. ### ""This is a hockey town and they've been with us through the ups and downs,"" center Ryan O'Reilly said. ""I don't think I'll be able to describe what it's going to be like. But from what I've seen I've been very impressed, and we're excited to get home to show what this town's about."" ### To show them good hockey, the Blues must try to avoid the penalty problems that plagued them in Boston. They were whistled for high-sticking, hooking, cross-checking, interference and slashing and twice for tripping and goaltender. ### Coach Craig Berube, seventh in NHL history with 3,149 penalty minutes mostly for fighting during his playing career, is not happy about his team's lack of discipline so far in the series. St. Louis got here in part because it only took 55 penalties in the first 19 playoff games, and Berube chalks the difference up to too much emotion and harps on it with players because he knows what Saturday night will be like. ### ""We talk about that a lot,"" Berube said. ""You have to keep your emotions in check."" ### That won't be a problem for Bruins agitator extraordinaire Brad Marchand, who days ago made it clear he doesn't care what Blues fans think of him. And that works in reverse, too. ### ""Every arena has roughly the same amount of people in it, so regardless of where you are in the NHL in the playoffs, you expect it to be loud,"" Marchand said. ""I expect the same tomorrow but not overly concerned about the fans. More concerned about the game."" ### What can happen in the game when Boston's playoff-leading power play goes to work is the main reason the Blues want to avoid penalties. The Bruins have only scored on two of their 10 power plays so far, but they've also used that time to generate momentum. ### On the flipside, so much time down 5-on-4 also puts wear and tear on the Blues' penalty killers and wreaks havoc on the flow of the game. They'd like to avoid that this time and give their long suffering fans something to cheer about. ### ""You try not to let the disruption of penalties and power plays affect you whether you're short-handed or on the power play,"" defenseman Robert Bortuzzo said. ""As a player, you just go out and you may be skipped over five shifts because of the disruption or whatnot, but it's easy to get emotionally invested and right back into it when that is the case."" ### ___ ### Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno  All rights reserved.

84211,"Get the best of The New Yorker in your in-box every day. ### Submit ### “Rocketman” and the Inevitable Shortcomings of the Hollywood Pop-Star Bio-Pic ### Taron Egerton as Elton John in a scene from from “Rocketman,” directed by Dexter Fletcher. ### Paramount Pictures / Entertainment Pictures / Alamy ### The pop-music bio-pics keep coming because they fulfill several basic needs, for viewers and for musicians. For viewers, the musical bio-pic offers an inside view of celebrity, involving the magic of supreme talent, the business practicalities that go into its realization, and the crafting and sustenance of a public persona apart from the artist’s private self. For artists (or their estates), bio-pics are a crucial marketing tool; they provide the ability to both produce and control their legacies and public images—and, for that matter, to propel themselves back into the forefront of mass media. At a time when record sales no longer exist, the bio-pic takes the place of the “greatest hits” album while also serving as its ad campaign. That’s why it’s no surprise that these movies are hardly ever any good. Nonetheless, the latest one, “Rocketman,” about the life of Elton John, delivers a primal gratification or two regarding the mystery and majesty of artistic creation and popular success, and their associated risks. ### As directed by Dexter Fletcher and written by Lee Hall, “Rocketman” views Elton John’s life from the perspective of rehab, which he entered in 1990 . (In the film, it happens in 1983.) As Elton (Taron Egerton), attending group therapy in an orange feathered and goat-horned stage costume, admits to his addictions (which he lists in a protracted and comedic litany that includes drugs, alcohol, sex, and shopping), he’s revisited by his childhood self, and the apparition launches the tale of his musical genesis. It does so with a musical-fantasy routine, the first of several production numbers that decorate the film with a charmless functionality, serving as the equivalent of music videos while John’s former hits play out on the soundtrack. The martial choreography and the Steadicam pursuits do little for, or to, the songs, but Egerton, who gamely if only efficiently does his own singing throughout, is no Channing Tatum. He’s more striking when his moves are threaded among the backup dancers than when he strides out in front of them. ### “Rocketman” tells the story of a misunderstood child who never overcomes his emotionally chilly upbringing. Born Reginald Dwight, the young John displays a precocious sunburst of musical talent at the family piano. But his father, Stanley (Steven Mackintosh), a jazz aficionado, is harsh and remote, and his mother, Sheila (Bryce Dallas Howard), absorbed in life’s daily struggles and lacking any emotional satisfactions of her own, is indifferent to her child’s exceptional talents. Fortunately, his grandmother, Ivy (Gemma Jones), is in the household, and, fulfilling the humorist Sam Levenson’s riff about grandparents and grandchildren being united by their common enemy, she does her best to foster Reggie’s talent, making sure that he benefits from a scholarship to music school and impressing upon him the importance of taking advantage of the few opportunities that life provides. ### “Rocketman” dutifully works its way through the breakup of Reggie’s parents’ marriage, his mother’s remarriage to a man named Fred (Tom Bennett), who has a rock-and-roll bent, and his abandonment of classical-piano studies to work in a bar band. There he makes his first contact with American—and black—musicians, one of whom gives him what’s presented as his first kiss from a man. He also delivers a crucial line that sets the tone for the rest of the film: “You’ve got to kill the person you were born to be in order to become the person you want to be.” It’s only there that, despite Fletcher’s sodden direction, the movie catches dramatic energy. Reggie drops into the office of a small record label and, taking the first name of Elton from a bandmate and the last name of John from Lennon, promotes himself as a songwriter. ### The aspiring Elton John’s scenes with an enthusiastic young employee named Ray Williams (Charlie Rowe) and the label’s gruff, brassy, and brutally frank boss, Dick James (Stephen Graham), enliven the film with the tantalizing rise of a public identity. We see hard-nosed and unsentimental business sense at work behind the birth of a star, and—as a result—Elton’s increasing alienation from the public persona that he creates, even as the spark of his musical ability becomes a raging fire. The producers slip him an envelope of lyrics that came in from a young writer named Bernie Taupin (played by Jamie Bell), and, just as Taupin’s lyrics provided the crucial springboard for John’s songwriting and performance, they provide the movie with its best moment, the one that defines it and the musical-bio-pic genre together: sitting down to the piano at his family’s house, Elton puts the lyrics to Taupin’s “Your Song” above the keyboard and, in a few seconds, picks out the tune to which he sets them. This depiction of spontaneous creation may be a cliché, but it’s one that’s rooted in Elton John’s real experience; it’s an exaggeration, but only a slight one—in 2013, Elton John told Cameron Crowe that he actually wrote the song in “about twenty minutes.” ### Creation is both a black box and a miracle, suggesting transcendence and ecstasy, possession and abandon—even if the physical action that it involves is comparatively plain and simple. The magic moment when the light bulb goes on over the artist’s head, when the thing for which the artist is celebrated happens, is irresistible even when it isn’t scripted or filmed well. This is true not only in the realm of art but in all sorts of endeavors; it can also be mathematics (“Hidden Figures”), the food industry (“The Founder”), investment banking (“The Big Short”), or police work (“BlacKkKlansman”). (And, of course, it isn’t necessarily even a true story—see any iteration of “A Star Is Born.”) But it’s with music that the idea itself provides immediate pleasure—and it’s in the life of the inspired performer that the public life threatens to take over the private one. ### “Rocketman” depicts that pathos yet blandly flattens it. Elton complains, in one of his disputes with Bernie, that he himself, the front man, is the one who can’t walk undisturbed in the street. He struggles (briefly and inconsequentially) with the need to maintain a strong and cheerful public face despite his private sadness and anger. Elton’s offstage tragedy involves the enduring wounds from his early family life, his frustrated quest for love, and his inability, as both a gay man and a public figure, to live his romantic life openly. He suffers bitter disappointment at the failure of his relationship with John Reid (Richard Madden), his manager and romantic partner, who, early in Elton’s years of stardom, warns him that revelations of his homosexuality would destroy his career and advises him to create a faux public relationship with a woman. ### Yet “Rocketman” is far from a drama of introspection—and, unfortunately, Edgerton’s performance, as directed by Fletcher, doesn’t add to the protagonist’s inner life. Fletcher (who also stepped in to complete “Bohemian Rhapsody” after its original director, Bryan Singer, was fired) doesn’t at all achieve with Egerton anything comparable to the performance of Rami Malek in the Freddie Mercury bio-pic. “Bohemian Rhapsody,” a mediocre movie, is lifted above its mediocrity solely by Malek’s performance, which conveys clearly and powerfully that Freddie (the character) perceives himself as a sort of freak or monster and has to overcome that dire self-image through his life as a famous artist. There’s nothing comparable in Egerton’s performance, which, though energetic and sympathetic, merely asserts Elton’s frustrations and goes through the paces of the singer’s life. ### “Bohemian Rhapsody” has been derided for downplaying Mercury’s homosexuality; “Rocketman” does the same with Elton’s sexuality, albeit in a different way. The new movie has a brief sex scene of little eroticism, which might as well have been a title card saying “They had sex.” Watching a scene in which Elton flaunts his sexual success to his mother (“I’ve fucked everything that moves!”) viewers are likely to wonder, Where? When?, because nothing in the film indicates that Elton has in fact done so. (Perhaps it’s the point of a ridiculous fantasy number set in a night club, in which he dances amid a group of bare-chested and leather-clad men.) ### The overriding emotion evoked by “Rocketman,” as by “Bohemian Rhapsody,” is the nostalgia for a mainstream, for a time before the Internet and a thousand channels and seemingly infinite access to a seemingly infinite variety of music and culture at large. That lost mainstream is spotlighted in passing when Elton learns, at a particular moment in the nineteen-seventies, that his albums account for five per cent of all records sold worldwide. At the same time, the movie indicates—though passingly, as in John Reid’s warning to Elton about keeping his sex life a secret—that the mainstream of the era was grossly discriminatory, and was a fabrication rooted in who and what it excluded. But whatever tension this duplicity and sense of exclusion caused Elton is unexplored in the movie’s drama. Elton John’s songs, for all their melodic charm, were edgeless vectors of instant nostalgia even at the time of their release. The edge was in the public persona, in the costumes and the manner, in the coded gayness. “Rocketman” hints as much only once, in a scene showing Elton’s mother watching Liberace on television. “Behind the Candelabra,” Steven Soderbergh’s extraordinary bio-pic of Liberace, is a useful comparison. Soderbergh doesn’t make a case for Liberace’s music; he makes a case for Liberace’s persona as the enduring and crucial work of art. “Rocketman,” by contrast, sacrifices the depth of Elton’s character to make a feature-length commercial for the real-life back catalogue.",060119,1,"“ Rocketman” dutifully works its way through the breakup of Reggie’s parents ’ marriage, his mother’s remarriage to a man named Fred (Tom Bennett), who has a rock-and-roll bent, and his abandonment of classical-piano studies to work in a bar band.

2646,"West Virginia:The other side of the story 01:01 ### Anthony Bourdain listened to the voices 'Hillbilly Elegy' ignored ### By Meredith McCarroll ### Updated 1737 GMT (0137 HKT) May 31, 2019 ### Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. ### Meredith McCarroll is the author of ""Unwhite: Apppalachia, Race, and Film"" (University of Georgia Press) and is co-editor with Anthony Harkins of ""Appalachian Reckoning: A Region responds to 'Hillbilly Elegy.'"" (West Virginia University Press).The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN . ### (CNN) ### Hillbillies. ### Meredith McCarroll ### Folks from Appalachia have been called a lot of things and often by people who flitted through long enough to find a well-rutted road, film a child on a porch with a dirty face, snap a shot of coalminers leaving their shift, and then leave to tell the same story that drew them to the region in the first place. A story of a place that is both impoverished and inspiring. Or, in writer and TV host Anthony Bourdain's words, ""heartbreaking and beautiful."" ### Appalachia was ""discovered"" first by ancient natives making their way from the west, and later (perhaps) by Hernando de Soto in the 16th century. The first gold rush of the 1820s, the copper mining of the 1840s, and the coal mining of the 1880s marked the first waves of extraction from the region by industrialists. But Appalachia has also been mined for images, and especially after President Lyndon Johnson launched the War on Poverty from a porch in Appalachia in 1964, this cycle has repeated itself. ### Read More ### Documentary has become another extractive industry with outsiders coming in to take what they need -- in this case a narrow image of a complex place. A scapegoat for the rest of the country. (For a recent example, see JD Vance's ""Hillbilly Elegy"" (2016) which traffics in tales and images of poverty, laziness, and self-abuse.) ### So, a few years back -- when Anthony Bourdain headed to West Virginia to film in McDowell County -- in places like War and Welch, a lot of people who care about the state and the region braced for the next iteration of performative discovery. Still, most of us watched the episode, which premiered the 11th season of CNN's ""Parts Unknown"" in April 2018, only weeks before Bourdain's death that June. ### Bourdain: The outsider who really listened ### "" Parts Unknown ,"" which aired from 2013 to 2018, was premised on bringing inaccessible regions into the living rooms of viewers, and it does a hell of a job complicating our preconceived notions about places by tying together cultures that are misunderstood with their foodways and art and geography. Hearing that Appalachia was one of these places felt strange to me. It's not like it's a foreign land. Interstate 81 runs right through it. ### Anthony Bourdain saw the humanity in all of us ### Now maybe people Bourdain visited with in Korea Town and Detroit didn't feel as touchy about being seen in this way. But not many regions have meant to the rest of the country what Appalachia has. Not many regions have been represented in such a narrow and unchanging way. Appalachia does not need one more outsider to come in and tell our stories. ### Yet, of course, we tuned in -- we prepared to watch as we had watched ""Christmas in Appalachia,"" the 1965 documentary by the Office of Economic Opportunity, and ""American Hollow,"" Rory Kennedy's 1999 feature documentary -- with that strange feeling of pride turned to instant shame. With a thousand exceptions and variations in mind for every image that seemed mined from the past. We watched ready to rant about this New Yorker coming into this so-called ""part unknown,"" a place we had known all our lives. ### When Bourdain opened the episode acknowledging his own position as a New Yorker going into the territory of the ""existential enemy,"" my interest was piqued. When he said, ""But this is not a poverty porn show. Do not pity the people here,"" I listened up. And when I recognized documentary filmmaker Elaine McMillion Sheldon , whose work explores America's opioid crisis and the future of Appalachia ,and Affrilachian artist and advocate Crystal Good on screen in the episode, I thought, ""OK, this guy's done his homework."" ### When Bourdain asked questions, he actually listened to the answers -- you could see it. And his framing of the whole endeavor with an awareness that ""it was always too easy to come gawk at West Virginia"" went a long way toward countering the image we were expecting of a city boy coming in to eat squirrel and ask people how they could vote for Trump. ### The Appalachian voices 'Hillbilly Elegy' left out ### Throughout the show, we cut from a football locker room to a heritage farm to a strip club and a strip mine. In the first three minutes of the episode, Bourdain showed more diversity in West Virginia than many viewers would expect. Before he arrived, somebody on his team did a lot of digging and contacted some of the most active and engaged hillbillies out there. And once he is sitting in front of them, he has the good sense to ask the simple question: What should people know about this place? ### JUST WATCHED ### MUST WATCH ### Anthony Bourdain explores cooking the Appalachian way 01:29 ### The answer he gets in the episode from Nick Mullins , who blogs as ""The Thoughtful Coal Miner,"" is ""How much the people in this area have been exploited."" But Bourdain isn't a timber man or a coal company. He isn't strip mining or in with Big Pharma . Most of us aren't. But most of us don't like to see that we still are a part of those systems. Not only when we drive or fly. But also when we turn on our televisions to ""gawk at"" Borneo or Sri Lanka. ### Exploitation takes many forms and serves multiple purposes. Anthony Bourdain seemed to understand that he was in a position where he could judge, make assumptions, and dismiss. But he was also in a position to learn, to hear, and to have his mind changed through deep empathy and curiosity -- which is what he chose to do. ### When thinking about who gets to tell a story, a tired insider/outsider debate tends to come up. Maybe you have to be born and raised somewhere to speak about it. Like Elaine McMillian Sheldon with McDowell County or photographer Roger May with Charleston, West Virginia. Or maybe you can move to another Appalachian place and invest in it and help its stories find light. Like novelists Robert Gipe and David Joy . Or public historian Elizabeth Catte. ### Maybe it is less about insiders and outsiders, and really comes down to empathy. ### Bourdain's Appalachian empathy endures for the rest of us ### J.D. Vance, raised in the Rust Belt with ties to Appalachia, rose to prominence with the publication of ""Hillbilly Elegy"" coinciding with (and enabling) his own political climb and birth as a venture capitalist. Vance uses the culture of poverty mythology to position himself as the hardworking one who escaped a dying place. Though he spent his summers in the region and has familial ties to Kentucky, Vance's view is judgmental more than empathetic. ### But then what do you do with an insider like J.D. Vance who never learned to listen? ### And what do you do with an outsider like Anthony Bourdain who did? ### Chef Edward Lee: Bourdain changed my life ### Throughout the episode, Bourdain authentically inserts his own voice. After acknowledging that he loves blowing things up, shooting pumpkins filled with explosives and sharing a venison burger with young gun enthusiasts (one of whom has an AR-15 tattoo on her arm), Bourdain pushes back. He points out that, despite his easy conversation over a sunset meal with these people with guns, not all people with guns are good. ### As he speaks his mind to his companions, the show cuts from the picturesque meal to footage of mass shootings in Parkland, Florida, and Las Vegas. ### When he talks with a Trump supporter, Bourdain asks how he could vote for someone so disconnected from the working class. When he joins a family for dinner, he asks both what is the best thing about living in West Virginia and what is the worst. He shares bear meat deep in a mine and listens to miners hope that their children find different work. ### He wonders why no one is talking about money as he enjoys foraged ramps with farmers and artists at Lost Creek Farm. Though he talks back, he doesn't have to have the final word. ### To Anthony Bourdain, Appalachia was a part unknown. But because he asked questions, he listened to answers, and he entered with empathy, he came to know one small corner of Appalachia. ### Stay up to date... ### Join us on Twitter and Facebook ### I was on a plane when news of Bourdain's suicide hit. As we landed and cell phones came off airplane mode, his name was quietly spoken. With surprise. With question. ""How could he kill himself?"" I heard someone ask with the same lack of thought that I've been asked, ""How could anyone live there?"" As if depression -- of a person or of a region -- is a thing you should (or could) just walk away from. As if some laziness allows it to take root, and some determination would be enough to change systems -- neurological or capitalist. ### A television show can only do so much. But this one might help us think about the danger of assumptions and it could remind us of the power of empathy. At any rate, Bourdain did a good enough job that all of the Appalachian folks I know, many of whom were ready to defend our strange land from the outsider, thought he did a good job. It's praise not easily won. ### Bourdain managed to give viewers a full and rich depiction of a place that is both heartbreaking and beautiful -- like life anywhere, if you're the kind of person who is smart enough to listen, brave enough to taste, and open enough to feel.",060119,1,"West Virginia: The other side of the story 01:01###Anthony Bourdain listened to the voices 'Hillbilly Elegy' ignored###By Meredith McCarroll###Updated 1737 GMT (0137 HKT) May 31, 2019","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]","<p>West Virginia: The other side of the story 01:01</p><p>Anthony Bourdain listened to the voices 'Hillbilly Elegy' ignored</p><p>By Meredith McCarroll</p><p>Updated 1737 GMT (0137 HKT) May 31, 2019</p>"

53551,"Phillies use an opener against Dodgers, but fall when closer Hector Neris gives up walk-off homer to Will Smith ### by Bob Brookover , Updated: June 2, 2019- 1:10 AM ### LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 01: Pitcher Jose Alvarez #52 of the Philadelphia Phillies pitches in the second inning of the MLB game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium on June 01, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. (Victor Decolongon/Getty Images/TNS) ### Victor Decolongon / MCT ### LOS ANGELES – A new era in Phillies baseball may have begun Saturday night in Dodger Stadium. Forced to come up with a backup plan after Zach Eflin landed on the injured list Friday, manager Gabe Kapler considered using traditional starters like Cole Irvin and Vince Velasquez. ### Instead, he settled upon what they call an opener in today’s game. ### Related stories ### Jose Alvarez to start for Phillies vs. Dodgers on Saturday ### In an effort to keep the high-powered Los Angeles Dodgers off balance in some way, shape or form, Kapler sent left-handed reliever Jose Alvarez to the mound for his first start since his rookie season in 2013. ### The strategy proved to be a sound one even if the Phillies did not get the desired result in a 4-3 walk-off loss to the Dodgers. After Bryce Harper tied the game with a two-run homer for the Phillies in the eighth, Los Angeles won it in the bottom of the ninth against Phillies closer Hector Neris when catcher Will Smith connected for a solo home run that just cleared the fence in left field. It was Smith’s first career home run. ### The Phillies, whose lead in the N.L. East slipped to two games over the Atlanta Braves, will try to avoid being swept Sunday at Dodger Stadium. ### Pin the blame on the offense, which managed just a single run on six hits in seven innings off Dodgers lefty Clayton Kershaw. In two losses to start the series, the Phillies have batted .181 (12-for-66) and managed just five runs. They have gone 3-for-16 with runners in scoring position in the two games, including 1-for-8 Saturday night. ### That lack of offense made Kapler’s opener plan a good idea that could not produce a good result. ### “We had a couple of considerations,” Kapler said. “The first was starting Cole Irvin. Another consideration was starting Vince Velasquez. The third consideration was having somebody start the game and seeing what they do with their lineup.” ### That somebody was Alvarez and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts did alter his lineup from the previous night with his team facing a lefty. Instead of six straight left-handed hitters at the top of his lineup, Roberts alternated right-handed and left-handed hitters through the top six spots in the order. ### The other strategy behind using an opener is limiting the number of times a pitcher must face the opposing team’s lineup since the numbers show the advantage shifts to the hitter the more times they see the same pitcher. ### Alvarez faced nine batters in his two innings and did not allow a run. He left the bases loaded in the second inning by getting pitcher to ground out to second base and then the strategy became to use Irvin in a more extended stint. Irvin surrendered a couple of runs in 3 2/3 innings, but did a more than respectable job to keep the Phillies in the game. ### Irvin left trailing 2-1 and the Dodgers made it 3-1 against Vinny Velasquez in the bottom of the seventh with an unearned run. Velasquez had only himself to blame, however, because it was his throwing error on a pickoff attempt at second that set up a sacrifice fly RBI for Max Muncy. Had Velasquez’s throw been on target, he would have nailed Matt Beaty at second base. ### After managing just one run in seven frustrating innings against Kershaw, Bryce Harper erased the Phillies’ two-run deficit with one swing in the top of the eighth off reliever Jose Urias. The Dodgers’ reliever hit Jean Segura with one out and then left a first-pitch slider over the plate to Harper, who crushed it into the left-center field seats for his 11th home run of the season. ### The Phillies’ dive into the new world of the opener dominated conversation before the game. The concept was introduced last season by the Tampa Bay Rays and it got legs around baseball because it worked for them. The number of teams doing it this season has grown to include teams like the New York Yankees, Milwaukee Brewers and many others. Now the Phillies have officially joined the club and it’s likely Kapler will employ the strategy again at some point. ### In fact, when asked, he did not rule it out opening the game with Alvarez again in the series finale against the Dodgers Sunday. ### “Anything is on the table,” he said. ### It seems unlikely Alvarez will open again, however, after throwing two innings and 30 pitches Saturday. ### Kapler said the players were in favor of the opener idea ahead of Saturday’s game. ### “One thing that is important to us as a coaching staff is not to impose our will on the players,” Kapler said. “We include the players in the process. They are a part of the strategy and we see them as partners in it. You’re never going to have 35 people all saying, ‘Yeah, that’s the perfect move.’ However, there is some real value in working on this as a team … and then making making the best strategic decision for the Phillies. I believe we are making that in this case.” ### You should probably expect Kapler to use the opener again. ### Posted: June 2, 2019 - 1:10 AM",060119,1,"The strategy proved to be a sound one even if the Phillies did not get the desired result in a 4-3 walk-off loss to the Dodgers.

Aren't You Taking Your Meds?"" ### It's easy enough to believe that once medicine is introduced, an illness will be cured. That's what we've been conditioned to believe, and hey, it works when you have the shits. Depression isn't combated so easily, though. And because it's so stubborn, medications tend to have super-fun ""bedding in"" periods, with symptoms that range from feeling even more depressed to losing your sex drive. It really is just a treat for everyone involved. Also, around 1 in 3 depressed patients don't see a benefit even after several attempts at treatment, and each switch can have weird side effects, like spontaneous ""electric shock"" sensations in the brain . The pills are often just the beginning of a different, weirder battle. ### Continue Reading Below ### Advertisement ### For me, once I found medication that didn't knock me out / make me fall over all the time / remove all feeling from my vagina (seriously), it still wasn't what we think of as a ""cure."" As a friend in a similar situation once told me, ""It lifts the darkness enough for you to make a plan to stop this from attacking your brain."" A combination of medication, therapy, and begrudgingly going running and doing yoga has been the best concoction for me so far, but not only is that not a universal cure, it may not even keep working for me. The brain will change, life will change, what works today may not work next year. ### Continue Reading Below ### 4 ### ""You Need To Get Out Of The House, Let's Go Out For A Drink!"" ### Alcohol can be a wonderful thing, of course, but it's also a depressant and will make symptoms worse in the long term. If you're trying to cheer up a friend who's struggling with depression, this is a cruel trick disguised as a gorgeous martini. Unless someone has made a conscious decision to take some time off the sauce, it's difficult for them to refuse an invitation to a bar, and even harder to not drink while they're there. Alcohol is the supposed antidote to depression's devious collaborator social anxiety, so they may feel like mingling in a crowd without it is unthinkable. ### Continue Reading Below ### Advertisement ### All of this is rich coming from me, who reaches for booze more readily than Trump reaches for petty nicknames. But I know that the following day's misery pit really isn't worth the previous night's Coyote Ugly reenactment. I've gotten to the point where if I know I'm doing something ""lively"" with friends, I'll make sure not to schedule anything important for the following day because the strain of the pretense of happiness combined with the depressive effects of the booze will render me dark and useless. ### Continue Reading Below ### Advertisement ### Not that you should just let your friend become a permanent muttering lump under a blanket. One tip you see a lot is to ask them if they want to go for a walk . It's not as exciting as the bar (well, depending on the bar), but excitement isn't the goal here. Walking next to someone is an opportunity to chat without having to make eye contact, which can in turn help someone open up about what might be troubling them. It's also a chance to look at some things that are scientifically proven to be uplifting, like trees and nature and children falling off bicycles. It's low-stress, it's exercise, and unlike the bar, it's free. ### Continue Reading Below ### 3 ### ""Here's Why You Should Be Happy, Like Me!"" ### Dealing with someone who has too much enthusiasm is annoying at the best of times (hi, James Corden), let alone when you're feeling like you need to hide from the world. When I'm feeling close to rock bottom, I just want to lock myself away in the dark. If that's not possible and people around me are clearly trying to be extra! happy! to cheer! me! up! then I get an added dose of guilt thrown in. ### Continue Reading Below ### Advertisement ### Depression has this super fun way of convincing us that we're a burden on all our friends and ruining their lives by existing. If those friends are quite obviously going above and beyond to be extra super happy cheery, then we'll A) know, B) feel guilty for making them do it, and C) feel worse because we're bringing them down. ### Professionals agree, by the way. ""What you are doing is downplaying the gravitas of the depressed person's plight,"" says counselor Philip Karahassan , ""by making the depressed person feel that their depressive situation is not important and that they are silly or wrong for the way that they connect to the situation."" You can let them talk about how they're feeling without thinking your happiness has to defeat their depression in a duel. ### Continue Reading Below ### 1 ### ""Me? I'm Doing Fine. Really. Fine!"" ### Living with the Great Depressed can really take it out of you, right? Trying to understand their situation, planning around bouts of inactivity, never expressing your frustration with someone who acts like they can't walk from the sofa to the mailbox even though they appear to be perfectly healthy ... ### But it's OK. Squashing down your feelings because they haven't been diagnosed as anything, carrying on as if everything's great and never acknowledging that you're finding this really f*****g hard will be fiiiiine. That resentment will surely never come leaping out of the darkness to ambush you when you least expect it. ### Continue Reading Below ### Advertisement ### When I was at my lowest, I later found out that it was really tough for my boyfriend because he ""never knew who was going to be at home that night."" Was I going to be faking my way through dinner and pretending to laugh at Drag Race, or would I be locked in the bedroom and totally unresponsive? We actually devised a very scientific system where I'd text him a rain cloud if I was feeling s**t, or a score out of ten and an actual message if I was feeling alright. ### This can -- surprise! -- affect their mental health, which is compounded by the feeling that their own problems aren't worth attention. He can't possibly complain about his stressful client call to someone who occasionally wants to kill herself, since that's so much worse. If you're trying to support and/or care for a depressed person, it can feel like they're sucking away all of your energy. It's draining enough that even therapists seek out the help of other therapists to deal with it, and they're getting paid. ### Continue Reading Below",060119,1,"I am Awesome!###5 Things Not To Say To A Depressed Loved One###Kate Lucey ·###June 01, 2019###Brains are tricky things.

Photograph: Noemi Bruzak/EPA ###  ###  ###  ### Hungarian divers struggled on Friday to reach the wreck of a pleasure boat that sank in the Danube river during a sightseeing trip in Budapest, killing seven South Korean tourists and leaving 21 people missing, feared dead. ### Seven South Koreans survived the sinking of the Hableány (“Mermaid” in Hungarian), which went down in seconds on Wednesday night after colliding with a much larger river cruise ship, whose captain has been arrested. Nineteen South Korean tourists and two Hungarian crewmen are unaccounted for. ### Prolonged heavy rain in the region has swelled the Danube and reduced visibility underwater, making the divers’ work more dangerous and increasing the likelihood that strong currents have swept victims far downstream. One body was found almost 12km from the site of the accident just hours after it occurred. ### “We have to prepare for a protracted search . . . The wreck is located more than six metres deep and the water level continues to rise,” said Hungary’s minister of foreign affairs Péter Szijjártó. ### His South Korean counterpart Kang Kyung-wha arrived in Budapest on Friday morning and went to the site of the sinking at Margit bridge in the centre of the city, where military, police and salvage vessels plied the murky and fast-flowing water. ### “I asked for an early raising of the sunken boat, and the expansion of the scope of search operations to neighbouring countries along the river,” she said. ### “We have firmly decided that we won’t give up our hopes about the possibility of finding survivors,” she added. ### Identified ### An unnamed official at South Korea’s foreign ministry told media in Seoul that only two victims had been identified so far, both women in their 50s. ### “They were identified because they had some form of identification with them. A total of 43 relatives of the victims are on their way to Hungary and will help identify the bodies as well,” the official said. ### South Korean divers and forensic experts who were involved in the response to the country’s 2014 Sewol ferry disaster, in which 304 people died, have also arrived in Budapest. ### “There is the possibility that some of the missing may be inside the boat, so we are requesting a speedy process with search and possibly salvaging the boat,” the South Korean official said. ### “We have also requested assistance from surrounding countries where the Danube flows to, such as Serbia , Croatia , Bulgaria and Romania , to help with the search work.” ### The 67-metre Hableány collided with the 135-metre Viking Sigyn cruiser as it completed an hour-long sightseeing trip, of the kind that is part of many tourists’ itinerary in the picturesque Hungarian capital. ### Detained ### Budapest police say they have detained the captain of the Swiss-owned cruise ship, a Ukrainian citizen identified as Yuriy C, on suspicion of “endangering waterborne traffic resulting in multiple deaths.” ### All those on the deck fell into the water and I think those staying in the cabin on the first floor probably couldn’t get out of the ship swiftly ### His lawyer, Balázs Tóth, told Hungarian media it was “premature, at the moment not more than a theory” to blame his client, who he said has 44 years of experience and strongly protests his innocence. The captain of the Hableány is among the missing. ### One survivor identified as Yoon (32) told South Korea’s Yonhap news agency: “Our boat was turned over in an instant and began sinking . . . All those on the deck fell into the water and I think those staying in the cabin on the first floor probably couldn’t get out of the ship swiftly.” ### Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán has spoken by telephone about the accident and rescue effort with South Korean president Moon Jae-in . ### “One is shaken by this . . . an accident happened where passengers had almost no chance for survival,” Mr Orbán said on Friday. ### “I have asked the authorities to carry out a strict and thorough investigation.”",060119,1,"“ I asked for an early raising of the sunken boat, and the expansion of the scope of search operations to neighbouring countries along the river,” she said.###“ We have firmly decided that we won’t give up our hopes about the possibility of finding survivors,” she added.###Identified###An unnamed official at South Korea ’s foreign ministry told media in Seoul that only two victims had been identified so far, both women in their 50s.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]","<p>“ I asked for an early raising of the sunken boat, and the expansion of the scope of search operations to neighbouring countries along the river,” she said.</p><p>“ We have firmly decided that we won’t give up our hopes about the possibility of finding survivors,” she added.</p><p>Identified</p><p>An unnamed official at South Korea ’s foreign ministry told media in Seoul that only two victims had been identified so far, both women in their 50s.</p>"

The long-running event is set to be a different show this year , as an increasing number of companies try new approaches. In maybe the most significant change, Sony won't be attending the show , which means there's no press conference devoted to the PlayStation or first-party PS4 games (though Death Stranding is getting some visibility before E3 begins, with a new trailer and its release date being revealed). Even so, there's a lot to look forward to, as E3 is sure to still bring tons of game reveals and news. ### But what's actually going to happen? The rumor mill has already begun, and things have started to leak (even if we've yet to get something on par with last year's Walmart Canada leak). Among the rumors to already pan out is that 2019's Call of Duty is Modern Warfare , which Activision has now confirmed. ### Meanwhile, Microsoft isn't waiting for its long press conference to start sharing news, as it's already revealed that Xbox Game Pass is coming to PC (which ties into a prediction below). It's also teasing 14 first-party games for its showing, where it could also announce its next-generation Xbox . Beyond that, publishers are largely keeping their lips sealed, but that doesn't mean we don't have some guesses as to what we should expect from E3 . Below, you'll find our predictions for what we think we'll get to see, including some exciting game reveals and ports. ### New From Software Game Revealed During Microsoft's Press Conference ### A Song of Ice and Fire author George R.R. Martin recently announced that he's been consulting with a Japanese developer on an upcoming game for a while now. Rumors point to the developer in question being From Software, the studio known for Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. A recent Gematsu report cites a source--someone described as ""familiar"" with what's going on at From Software--who says the rumors are true and that the game will be announced at E3 2019 during Microsoft's press conference . ### Even if neither From Software nor Martin have stepped forward to confirm the rumors, I'm inclined to believe they're true. From Software's Soulsborne games are dark fantasies that regularly kill off important characters and weave together convoluted, but well-written narratives, much like Martin's novels. It seems like a match made in heaven. Plus, From Software director Hidetaka Miyazaki has already confirmed the developer has two more games on the way . ### According to Gematsu's report, From Software's new game will be open world, allow you to travel by horse, and features multiple kingdoms to explore. Killing the leaders of each kingdom allows you to unlock new, powerful abilities. You can read more about it in our E3 2019 rumor roundup . -- Jordan Ramée ### Halo TV Series First Trailer And Details ### After many false starts, the small-screen adaptation of Halo finally appears to be gathering momentum. After losing its director last year , we’ve seen steadily seen more signs of life over the last several months. In February, Showtime announced that Black Mirror director Otto Bathurst would serve as director and executive producer. In March it reportedly added a second showrunner . And most recently, in April, the show announced its star: Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief . ### With development speeding up, the time is right for 343 to start giving more concrete details--and where better to do that than a stage show packed with Halo fans, and hundreds of thousands more watching at home? It’s a golden opportunity we don’t think Microsoft will allow to pass it by. A teaser trailer followed by a premiere date, possibly with 343 head Bonnie Hunt or transmedia director Kiki Wolfkill peppering in some intriguing details, would hit the spot. -- Steve Watts ### Metroid Prime Trilogy Announced For Nintendo Switch ### We may not yet know what Nintendo plans to showcase during its E3 2019 presentation, but one game we can safely say is still a long way off is Metroid Prime 4. Earlier this year, Nintendo made the shocking announcement that development on the game had effectively restarted , this time with original Metroid Prime developer Retro Studios at the helm, which means it'll likely be some time before the title is ready to be shown off, let alone released. But while the new Metroid Prime game may still be a few years away, that doesn't mean the series will be absent from E3 entirely, and what better way to ease the sting of Metroid Prime 4's delay than by unveiling a Nintendo Switch version of Metroid Prime Trilogy. ### Rumors that the collection is getting ported to the hybrid console have been cropping up consistently over the past few months. Shortly after the news of Metroid Prime 4's delay, Game Informer editor Imran Khan claimed that a Switch port of Metroid Prime Trilogy was already complete , but Nintendo was sitting on it until the opportune moment. If that wasn't enough, listings for the game have popped up at various retailers, most recently in Best Buy's employee system last month. With Metroid Prime 4 still a way off, this would be a perfect opportunity to unveil Metroid Prime Trilogy for Switch. Not only would it tide Metroid fans over until there's more news to share about Metroid Prime 4, but it would also introduce a new generation of players to one of the greatest trilogies in gaming. -- Kevin Knezevic ### Tap To Unmute ### Please use a html5 video capable browser to watch videos. ### This video has an invalid file format. ### HTML5 ### Sorry, but you can't access this content! ### Please enter your date of birth to view this video ### By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's ### enter ### Xbox Game Pass / xCloud Integration ### Microsoft has made some bold moves with its Xbox Game Pass, most notably promising day-one releases for all first-party games and regularly securing day-one releases for indies on its platform. With the impending announcement of its xCloud streaming platform , it could make a big splash all over again, and in the process help define the future of gaming. ### Google Stadia showed off some impressive-looking tech, but the lingering question was left: how will this be monetized? Microsoft xCloud, or whatever the company eventually calls it, will likely face similar questions. The company could get ahead of the speculation, and win over hearts and minds, by announcing integration between xCloud and Xbox Game Pass. A streaming platform naturally lends itself to an all-you-can-eat model a la Netflix, so consumers already understand the model. And with recent suggestions that Microsoft is eyeing other platforms for its streaming tech, this synergy would tee up Microsoft to be ubiquitous in video games, on all platforms. -- Steve Watts ### Cyberpunk 2077 Gets A Release Date ### CD Project Red has already confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 will be at E3 2019, even if the game won't be playable during the event . The developer plans on showcasing new gameplay during the show, and releasing additional details about the upcoming RPG. ### I think one of those details will be a launch date. It's about time CD Projekt Red provides some sort of timetable for the game they've been teasing since 2013, even if it's just confirmation for which year we can expect to see the game release. In August 2018, Cyberpunk 2077 producer Richard Borzymowski revealed the game is already playable from start to finish , so a release in 2019 or 2020 seems plausible. If the former, it makes even more sense that we'd get a release date during E3. ### Of course, CD Projekt Red could easily decide to keep those details close to the chest for a little while longer. The developer is known for revealing new information slowly . If no release date gets announced, perhaps CD Projekt Red will at least take advantage of E3 to explain why it enlisted multiplayer-focused studio Digital Scapes . -- Jordan Ramée ### Rocksteady's Next Game Revealed ### Bucking the long-time stigma that licensed superhero games were doomed to fail, developerRocksteady Games made a name for themselves with the Batman Arkham series--which are arguably the greatest Batman games ever made. 2015'sBatman Arkham Knight was the concluding chapter to the series focusing on the Dark Knight's struggles to maintain control of Gotham City from The Joker and other supervillains. With a rather definite ending, there didn't seem much room to continue with just another sequel. ### Aside from the release of Batman Arkham VR, we haven't seen another Batman game since the release of Arkham Knight. WB Montreal, who produced the often overlooked Batman Arkham Origins, has also kept quiet. According to Rocksteady co-founder and creative director Sefton Hill , the developers have been at work on their next title since 2016. With E3 2019 approaching, now seems like an opportune time to finally reveal the developer's next project. So far, the only specific info we have is that the next game will likely have an online component of some form, as the developers recently had open positions for multiplayer designers. ### Following the Arkham series, there's been a noticeable uptick in the quality of superhero games, and with Marvel's Spider-man showing that other stellar games in the genre can exist too, it's time for WB and Rocksteady to follow-up with their next project. Whether it's a new Batman game, or something branching out into the broader DC comics universe, Rocksteady's next big game will be something that many fans will want to see sooner rather than later. -- Alessandro Fillari ### Tap To Unmute ### enter ### Halo Infinite Release Date And New Details ### It's finally going to happen: Microsoft will announce Halo Infinite's release date and talk more about the ambitious sci-fi shooter at its E3 2019 briefing. It's been a long time coming. Halo 5: Guardians was released almost four years ago, so fans have been waiting a long time for news about the next mainline instalment in the classic series. At E3 2019, Microsoft will finally tell us when Halo Infinite is releasing and also what kind of game it actually is. ### So far all we've seen is a mood piece for the game's brand-new engine, Slipspace. That's all well and good (the engine looks very impressive), but it is finally time for Microsoft to pull back the curtain and tell us just what the hell Halo Infinite is and when we can play it. The company has talked about letting fans play early through betas, and it could be a huge win for Microsoft to be able to say, ""Play the beta later this year"" or even early 2020. The Halo franchise has fallen out of prominence, and a big showing at E3 2019 could be just what the series needs. -- Eddie Makuch ### Mother 3 Releases On Nintendo Switch, Today! ### It may be a pipedream, but Nintendo would be remiss to go another year at E3 without announcing the western release of Mother 3. E3 2019 would serve as a perfect venue for Nintendo to finally lift the veil over an official Mother 3 localization and release. And better yet: I believe it'll release the game the very same day! It handled the series' debut--titled Earthbound Beginnings--the very same way, after all--in addition to several other games throughout the years. My guess is that Mother 3 will be available shortly after the Direct showcase as an Eshop exclusive. ### While such a reveal would spark massive excitement, I admit that it would be even greater if Nintendo one-upped our expectations by announcing at E3 that it's committing to a full-on Mario & Luigi-style Mother 3 remake with new mechanics and remastered visuals. Given how badly fans have wanted the game, a remake would seem the proper way to bring Mother 3 to western audiences. Though, if this turns out to be the case, it would be great to have the GBA original included as a bonus somehow. ### Nintendo has kept quiet about a potential Mother 3 western release in the past year, but it does know the desire for it. Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime has repeatedly mentioned this awareness . However, Game Informer editor Imran Khan claimed in an ResetEra post circulated that Nintendo's effort to localize Mother 3 had allegedly ended due to characters and scenes deemed too controversial for the company. ### It's difficult to say what might become of Mother 3 in the west, but I'm crossing my fingers that it's still on Nintendo's radar. The company is known for its E3 surprises, so this year's big show could be the one where we finally hear the Mother 3 announcement we've been waiting over a decade for now. -- Matt Espineli ### Next-Gen Fable ### The Fable series is not as popular or front-of-mind as it used to be when Peter Molyneux was leading the RPG series. Not only is Molyneux long gone, but Microsoft closed developer Lionhead. But Fable is a very important franchise for Microsoft, and at E3 this year we will finally hear about Microsoft's plans to bring it back--with a new studio. Microsoft's newly acquired studio Playground, of Forza Horizon fame, recently moved to a massive new studio and announced plans to staff up big time for an unannounced AAA role-playing game. ### That game is Fable 4, and we are excited to see the look and direction for the esteemed RPG series. With Microsoft also tipped to announce a next-generation Xbox (or two!) at E3, the company could wow Fable fans with an impressive demo for what the new Fable game will look like and the depth it will offer thanks to the power of the new machines. After the unfortunate closing of Lionhead and cancellation of Fable Legends, the Fable franchise could return stronger than ever. -- Eddie Makuch ### Ninja Theory's New Game, Bleeding Edge, Gets Announced ### The developers at Ninja Theory have kept quiet about their next project ever since last year's announcement that Microsoft acquired the studio . During E3 2018, Xbox head Phil Spencer went into detail about Microsoft's plans to focus more on first-party content with a new studio named The Initiative--and Ninja Theory was among many other developers set to produce a new exclusive game for the company. It also happens to mark the first time in 12 years that Ninja Theory will develop a new first-party exclusive game, with the first being the PS3's Heavenly Sword. ### With E3 2019 approaching, and Microsoft planning to pull out all the stops for their June 9 presentation, now is the best time for Ninja Theory to reveal their next big project. Recently, International Business Times reported that Ninja Theory filed a trademark for the name Bleeding Edge, which may be its next title. Aside from the name, not much is known about the game. But given the studio's pedigree for blending action with strong storytelling, it seems like a given that next title will focus on that. ### It's been exciting to see Ninja Theory hone its craft and particular style over the years. The studio's breakout hit Heavenly Sword showed a lot of promise, but it was clear the developers still had some growing to do in order get to where they needed to be. They would eventually hit those marks with games like DmC: Devil May Cry and Hellblade--both of which showed stellar craft for action-gameplay and storytelling respectively. Though we'll likely never get the proposed DmC sequel that Capcom and NT had plans to work on, this new game could be the next best thing. I predict that Ninja Theory's next big game will make an appearance at this year's E3, and if it can match the quality of their last two games, then we're in for something captivating. -- Alessandro Fillari ### Microsoft Will Announce Another Studio Acquisition ### Over the years, Microsoft has been criticized for not having the same level of first-party developers as Sony and Nintendo. Halo, Gears, and Forza games are often great, but what else could Microsoft offer? Last year saw the company take some significant steps to address those complaints, announcing the acquisition of a variety of studios, including Obsidian Entertainment (of Fallout: New Vegas and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 fame) and Ninja Theory (DMC: Devil May Cry, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice). ### They may not all be ready to show off what they've been working on for Microsoft, but I'm expecting to both get a look at some of those games and to hear that Microsoft has acquired another studio or two. While there were some big names among last year's group, I could see Microsoft now going in the other direction and acquiring some quality small studios. Perhaps it could even target some of the developers to release their games at launch through Xbox Game Pass. -- Chris Pereira ### Tap To Unmute ### enter ### Ubisoft Reveals The Next Assassin's Creed, And It's Called Ragnarok ### Sure, the leaked images and assets for Assassin's Creed Ragnarok were confirmed to be fake. But that doesn't mean that Ubisoft isn't creating something similar with the next installment of Assassin's Creed, reportedly (according to Kotaku ) referred to as ""Kingdom."" ### All we know for sure is that Kingdom takes the Assassin's Creed franchise to the Age of Vikings and is scheduled to release in 2020. If Ubisoft sticks to its traditional pattern, that means a teaser trailer and name drop during E3 this year, and Ragnarok could be a likely candidate for a name. Not only is the term tied to Viking culture (it's the name of a cataclysmic event in Norse mythology), but the themes behind the word could apply to Kingdom's story. ### In Norse mythology, Ragnarok is the destruction of the gods, an end to the old conflicts, and the rebirth of the world with two remaining humans (Líf and Lífþrasir) leading humanity into a new age. Ubisoft's past two Assassin's Creed titles, Origins and Odyssey, dealt with the secret war between the Order of Ancients and the Hidden Ones. Assassin's Creed Ragnarok could be a symbolic title, one that references how the game's events ultimately destroy this old conflict, only to give rise to a new one between the two groups that define humanity going forward: the Templar Order and Assassin Brotherhood. The Age of Vikings does roughly last from 793 to 1066 AD, after all, ending just over a century before the events of the original Assassin's Creed. -- Jordan Ramée ### Splatoon 2 Is Getting A 5.0 Update And Another Year Of Splatfests ### The original Splatoon was a remarkable success considering it was a new, untested property that debuted toward the tail end of Nintendo's poorest-performing home console. However, its Switch follow-up, Splatoon 2, transformed the burgeoning series into one of Nintendo's most popular franchises. Since its launch back in 2017, the game has sold close to nine million copies worldwide and remains one of the preeminent reasons to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service. Given the runaway success Splatoon 2 has had thus far, it would only make sense for Nintendo to announce another big update for the game at E3 2019. ### Before Splatoon 2's release, Nintendo said it would support the title with a full year of free post-launch updates, while its Splatfest competitions would be held monthly for two years. That two-year mark is approaching this July and Nintendo has not indicated that its plans have changed, which is why it would be such a great surprise to see the company announce that not only is a major 5.0 update on the way, but Splatfests will be extended for another full year. The Switch is still very much in the early years of its life, and Splatoon 2 has proven to be one of the console's best-selling titles, so it wouldn't make business sense to undercut its success by prematurely stopping support. Moreover, Nintendo is hosting another Splatoon 2 World Championships tournament ahead of its E3 presentation, which is indicative of how important the game is. That would be the perfect venue to announce that more Splatoon content is on the way. -- Kevin Knezevic ### Xbox Game Pass Announced For PC With Play Anywhere Support ### Recent years have seen Microsoft's gaming efforts increasingly focus on ubiquity--hence why we've seen something like Xbox Live support in the Nintendo Switch version of Cuphead. Predicting an expansion for Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's Netflix-style subscription service, isn't exactly bold; CEO Satya Nadella said last year that Game Pass is coming to PC . But I think we'll see not just the official announcement of this at E3, but also some other welcome news. [Update: Microsoft has now more formally announced that Xbox Game Pass is coming to PC , and that it will use that same name. Like the Xbox version, it will offer access to a variety of games, including some as soon as they are released. Further details are to be announced during Microsoft's E3 press conference.] ### First, I expect that Game Pass on PC will be a built-in part of the existing Game Pass subscription; you won't be expected to pay for a separate service, as is the case with EA Access and Origin Access. Whether you want to download and play something on your Xbox One or PC, you'll be free to do so with that single subscription. ### Further blurring the lines between those platforms, I think Game Pass will combine with Play Anywhere to let you seamlessly move back and forth between PC and console versions of a game. It could even tie into xCloud, as Steve predicted above, but I think Microsoft will use Game Pass to continue eliminating barriers we've dealt with for years. -- Chris Pereira ### Filed under:",060119,1,"After many false starts, the small-screen adaptation of Halo finally appears to be gathering momentum.

The other was a contractor there on business. Seven of the victims were men, five were women. Their time of service with the city ranged from 11 months to 41 years. ### The four who were injured remain in serious condition, Police Chief James Cervera said. ### Sign up for World-Herald news alerts ### Be the first to know when news happens.

Two detective supervisors rushed to the building and arrived within minutes of receiving the dispatch call, Cervera said. Two officers with canines quickly joined them. ### ""They were out of the (police headquarters) building instantaneously,"" the chief said.

4301,"The Ring of Fire Network ### No One Is Stealing Our Jobs – Corporations Are Sending Them Away ### By ### Email ### Donald Trump and the Republicans like to blame countries like China, Mexico, and others of stealing American jobs, but the truth is that these jobs are being given up willingly by American corporations who want to exploit cheap labor. This has been happening for decades, and Trump himself has benefited from this system. If we want to bring back our jobs, we have to go after the corporations who are sending them away, as Ring of Fire’s Farron Cousins explains.  ### Earlier this week, Cody Cane, writing on salon.com, put forward one of the best articles that I think I’ve run a very, very long time. This article’s titled, No, Mr President, China didn’t steal our jobs. Corporate America gave them away. And this is actually something that I, I was really surprised to read because it’s something I’ve been thinking for a very long time. You know, we have Trump and the Republicans and hell, even some Democrats out there saying that China’s steel and American jobs before that, remember it was Mexico stealing American jobs. You know, you’ve got all these other Asian countries stealing American jobs as if they’re somehow coming over here. You know, put their little ski masks on, break into Ford or carrier and steal our jobs. Well, that’s not what happened. And Cody Cane, writing for salon.com, explains it. He says they didn’t steal anything. What they did was accepted gift, a gift that was legal, a gift that was technically proper. What the gift was. American corporations reaching out and saying, can we build factories over here in your country? Please. Thank you. We’ll put your people to work. You know, you, you’ve got an unemployment problem, we’ll fix it for you. They can come work for us. ### And it’s not just China again, happens in Mexico, happens in further Latin America, happens in Asian countries all over American corporations reaching out saying we want to go to a different country because your labor laws a little or a little more lax. We didn’t, we don’t have to pay our workers decent wages over in your country. We do over here we don’t have to worry about things like you know, worker safety and hardhats and goggles and all that crap that costs us money. Uh, in your country. We have to worry about it over here. So we’ll come to your country, will employ your people, will put money into your economy. All we ask is that you kind of go easy on the labor laws and that is exactly what happened. That’s exactly what’s been happening for decades in the United States. It didn’t start under Donald Trump. It started decades ago. But the reason it’s still happens today. The reason we saw corporations just last week again, lay off hundreds upon hundreds of white collar workers, decent, good, uh, upper middle class jobs gone last week alone is because they want to send them to other countries. We want to put our call centers over in India, you know, and pay those people pennies on the dollar. We don’t want to do that here in the United States. ### Nobody is stealing our jobs. Corporations are sending them away willfully because they can and that’s the problem because they can. We’re not penalizing these, these companies. We’re still buying up their products. We’re still giving them government contracts. We’re giving them our tax dollars. We’re letting them hide their money off shore. ### There has to be some kind of punishment. The CEO’s and the shareholders is Cody cane pointed out, they’re the ones who are making more money than ever now because they’re able to ship our jobs overseas and pay less in wages, not have to pay for workplace protections. All that extra money saved goes into the pockets of those people. American workers get laid off. They have nowhere else to go. They have to take a lesser job and hope that that one doesn’t also get shipped overseas. The corporations are the ones that need to be held accountable. We have to stop blaming. China stopped blaming Mexico, and we have to look at the real villains in this story. In the villains are the corporations, and Trump can get out there on Twitter. He can talk about it on stage. All he wants that he’s being tough against China for stealing our jobs, but he is 100% part of the problem. ### After all, where’s Donald Trump’s garbage made? It’s made in China. Where does Donald Trump get all the workers for his golf resorts? He brings them in from Mexico on, you know, seasonal visas and then so ships and back after the season’s over, he’s part of the problem. He’s not using American labor. He’s not keeping his crap here in the United States to be built here by Americans for Americans. He is not hiring Americans, don’t work at his clubs. So yeah, next time he says corporations, or excuse me, China or Mexico, or stealing our jobs. No. People like him are willfully giving those jobs to those countries because they think it’s going to mean that they get to keep more money for themselves.",060119,1,"And it’s not just China again, happens in Mexico, happens in further Latin America, happens in Asian countries all over American corporations reaching out saying we want to go to a different country because your labor laws a little or a little more lax.

21620,"Contact Editor ### Darrell Wallace, Jr. has a new sponsor livery on the No. 43 Richard Petty Motorsports Chevrolet at Pocono Raceway this weekend, and it speaks to creative financing that will benefit not only Wallace but also children attending the Victory Junction Gang Camp. ### World Wide Technology founder and chairman David Steward and his family made a leadership gift to the Victory Junction gang Camp, in support of the camp’s mission to enrich the lives of children with chronic medical conditions and serious illnesses. ### Victory Junction, in turn, will appear with World Wide Technology on Wallace’s car for 16 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series races this season, starting this weekend at the Tricky Triangle. The sponsorship, which operates with the mantra “Feel Your Heart Race,” is fully funded by the Steward Family Foundation through the donation designed to promote the camp and its work with children. ### To team owner Richard Petty, it’s an important breakthrough for an organization that has been operating on a smaller budget than many of its rivals in the Cup series. ### “It’s always important to have good backing for your race car,” Petty said on Friday during the announcement at Pocono Raceway. “We’ve got a pretty good driver — we’ve just got to get him a better car. As everybody knows, it takes money to make a better car… ### “It’s a perfect storm for us from a racing standpoint and a perfect storm for Victory Junction to get the name out there. A lot of people’s heard tell of it but don’t know what it is. This is going to give everybody a chance to see what Victory Junction really does.” ### Wallace found out on Tuesday that the partnership had been finalized. ### “I was kind of speechless at first,” Wallace acknowledged. “…We’ve got an opportunity to set the world on fire. To speak on Victory Junction, I’ve been able to visit twice, three times maybe, and there’s no cooler special place to see. The kids light up and let themselves be kids again.” ### After Last Year’s Warm-Up, Erik Jones Keeps On Truckin’ In Cup Car ### Erik Jones ran one NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series race last year, in a substitute role for Noah Gragson at Kyle Busch Motorsports. ### As it turned out, that experience informed his opening Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series practice session at Pocono Raceway, where Jones started 31st in the No. 18 truck last year because of the driver change and charged to a runner-up finish. ### “I never really would have thought this, but I drove that truck here last year filling in, and it actually helped me a lot making my first few laps (in Friday’s Cup practice), because I kind of knew it would be similar to that,” Jones said Friday during a question and answer session with reporters at the Tricky Triangle, venue for Sunday’s Pocono 400. ### “So I tried to copy that a little bit, and it was pretty close. You lift probably a little more in (turn) 1 than I thought, I guess if I really have to pin it down, but you’re carrying a lot of speed. You’re not off the throttle much, compared to what we had here the last couple years.” ### The higher-downforce, lower-horsepower competition package introduced this year will yield significant differences in the way drivers turn a lap at the 2.5-mile, three-cornered track. For one thing, a new gear rule effectively eliminates shifting gears down the frontstretch. For another, off-throttle time is lessened, though Jones found in practice that he was using more brake than he expected. ### “Probably more than I thought,” acknowledged Jones, who was fourth on the speed chart in final practice. “Going into the weekend, yeah, I didn’t think we’d be needing much of any (brake) in any of the corners, really. ### “I’m using a little bit into (turn) 1 — I mean a really small amount. None really into (turns) 2 or 3. Not any significant amount. I didn’t know that we’d be using any brake, so it’s a little bit more than I thought. As far as throttle traces and how I thought it was going to drive, it feels pretty close.” ### Short Strokes ### -Daniel Suarez sustained his ascendance in Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series practice — at least for one session. After leading both Saturday sessions for last week’s Coca-Cola 600, Suarez was fastest in Friday’s opening session at Pocono Raceway, turning a lap at 171.217 mph. “I feel like we need to be a little bit better in the longer runs,” said the driver of the No. 41 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford, who was 17th fastest in happy Hour… ### -Kurt Busch jumped to the top of the speed chart late in final practice, posting a speed on 172.712 mph on his fastest lap. Brad Keselowski was second quickest at 171.798 mph, followed by Kyle Larson, Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. and Kyle Busch… ### -John Hunter Nemechek lost control of his No. 23 Chevrolet and backed it into the turn 1 wall early in Friday’s opening NASCAR Xfinity Series practice. Because of extensive damage to the rear and driver’s side of the car, Nemechek’s GMS Racing team opted to go to a backup car and spent the rest of first practice and beyond preparing the backup for the second session. Nemechek was 14th fastest in Xfinity Happy Hour but trailed leader Cole Custer (169.383 mph) by more than three miles per hour. ### WDUN will have MRN Radio live coverage from Pocono Raceway beginning on Saturday with the NASCAR Xfinity Series Pocono Green 250 beginning at 12:30 on 102.9 FM and streaming live on AccessWDUN.  It continues on Sunday with the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Pocono 400 beginning at 1 pm on 102.9 FM, AM 550 and streaming live on AccessWDUN . ### Associated Categories: Sports , NASCAR News, Monster Cup ### Associated Tags: nascar, motorsports, xfinity series, Auto Racing, Stock Car, Asphalt, Motorsports Live On WDUN, Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series ### © Copyright 2019 AccessWDUN.com",060119,1,"“ I’m using a little bit into (turn) 1 — I mean a really small amount.

Now he was being held on a $1 million bond. ### HOGP ### Save ### In this April 10, 2019 photo, Wayne Sankey sits on the front steps of his Lakewood, Wis. home where he is the neighbor of Raymand Vannieuwenhoven, who authorities say is the suspect in a cold-blooded 43-year-old cold case murder. The news of Vannieuwenhoven's arrest hit Sankey, 68, like a thunderbolt. Prosecutors said they used DNA and genetic genealogy to connect Vannieuwenhoven to the 1976 killings of a young couple, David Schuldes and Ellen Matheys. ### Ivan Moreno ### Arrest in 43-year-old murder case stuns Wisconsin town ### By IVAN MORENO Associated Press ### Jun 1, 2019 ### Save ### LAKEWOOD, Wis. (AP) — Word of the arrest — via a friend's text message — hit Wayne Sankey like a thunderbolt. ### ""I said, 'You gotta be kidding me,'"" Sankey recalled. ""And then I told the wife and she couldn't believe it. 'There's no way,' she said. 'Ray down the road?'"" ### Ray Vannieuwenhoven was his next-door neighbor — a helpful, 82-year-old handyman with a gravelly voice and a loud, distinctive laugh. ### The widower and father of five grown children had lived quietly for two decades among the 800 residents of Lakewood, a northern Wisconsin town. ### Now authorities were saying he was a killer. They had used genetic genealogy to crack a cold case that stretched back well into the 20th century — a double murder 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Lakewood. ### For nearly 43 years, Vannieuwenoven had lived in plain sight, yet outside detectives' radar. ### It was just too much to be believed. Was the guy next door really a monster? ### ——— ### David Schuldes and Ellen Matheys, engaged to be married, set up their campsite at a secluded spot in McClintock Park on Friday afternoon, July 9, 1976. ### It appeared they were alone. ### Two shots from a .30-caliber rifle shattered the quiet. One bullet struck Schuldes' neck from 50 feet (15 meters) away, killing him instantly. The other bullet lodged in the wall of the bathroom Matheys was using while Schuldes waited outside. ### Matheys ran, with the killer in pursuit, investigators say. He caught and raped her, then shot her twice in the chest. Her body was found 200 yards (182 meters) from where Schuldes lay. ### Investigators were stumped: They didn't know why the couple was targeted, the killer took no money, and leads were scant. ### DNA profiling in the '90s brought new hope, but detectives got no matches when they submitted the semen from Matheys' shorts to the FBI's national database. ### Then last year, detectives contacted Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a DNA technology company whose work with genetic genealogy analysis has helped police identify 55 suspects in cold cases nationwide since May 2018, according to the company. Parabon uploads DNA from crime scenes to GEDmatch, a free, public genealogy database with about 1.2 million profiles, all voluntarily submitted by people who've used consumer genealogy sites. ### California law enforcement used GEDmatch to capture the Golden State Killer last year by finding distant relatives and reverse-engineering his family tree. ### Using that technique, Parabon's experts concluded in December that Vannieuwenhoven's parents had lived in the Green Bay area. Now detectives needed DNA samples from Vannieuwenhoven and his three brothers. Two were ruled out with DNA samples collected from one brother's trash and another's used coffee cup. ### On March 6, two sheriff's deputies knocked on Vannieuwenhoven's door, asking him to fill out a brief survey on area-policing. They told him to put the survey in an envelope and seal it with his tongue. ### Detectives didn't need to visit the fourth brother. Eight days later, Vannieuwenhoven was in custody. ### × ### ——— ### At Vannieuwenhoven's first court appearance, on March 22, bond was set at $1 million. ### ""Not guilty, not guilty, not guilty,"" Vannieuwenhoven said, when the judge asked him if he understood the charges. His next court date is June 19. ### Kurt Schuldes, 68, a cousin of David Schuldes in Green Bay, welcomed the news of an arrest, but lamented the time it took: ""He just got away with it for way too long, unfortunately."" ### ""It was a long time coming,"" said Cynthia Chizek, Matheys' 53-year-old niece, who lives in Henderson, Nevada. ""It's just something that always hangs over your head, knowing that there's someone out there who did this heinous crime."" ### Subscribe to Breaking News ### Sign up!  ### Prosecutors and Lakewood residents, meanwhile, were left with the question: Who is Raymand Lawrence Vannieuwenhoven? ### Richard Leurquin, twin brother of Vannieuwenhoven's dead wife, Rita, said his brother-in-law was ""a very loving father to his wife and kids."" He's convinced Vannieuwenhoven is innocent. ### After Rita died in 2008, Sankey said Vannieuwenhoven spent his days fishing, hunting, and going on weeks-long camping trips. ### But Vannieuwenhoven had a dark side and has been jailed before. ### In 1957, already married and going by the name Lawrence Vannieuwenhoven, he received a six-month sentence for an unprovoked attack on a 17-year-old girl. She was walking with three friends when Vannieuwenhoven struck her on the back, face, and shoulder. ### In 1960, he pleaded guilty to not providing financial support to his wife and their 1-year-old daughter, the Green Bay Press-Gazette reported then. He was on probation for a year. ### More recently, some neighbors caught glimpses of a menacing side when he drank. He stopped only a few years ago, for his health, they said. ### ""I know this much — when he was drinking he was one son of a bitch,"" said Fred Mason, 66, who works at the town dump where Vannieuwenhoven was seen frequently, rummaging through scrap piles. ### Robert Ganzell, 86, and his wife sometimes dined out with Vannieuwenhoven. He heard from others that he had a temper when he drank, but Ganzell said he never witnessed it. ### Sankey, 68, said he and his wife are still coming to terms with the allegations against their neighbor. ### ""People had the impression that he was a very good, normal person, just a retired guy,"" Sankey said. ### ———",060119,1,"LAKEWOOD, Wis.

61574,"e-mail ### PUNTA CANA, Dominican Republic (AP) - Police in the Dominican Republic are investigating an attack on a U.S. tourist in Punta Cana that the woman recently made public on social media, detailing a vicious hours-long assault by a man she said was wearing the uniform of an all-inclusive resort. ### Police spokesman Col. Frank Durán on Friday said that immediately after authorities heard of the January attack investigators went to the hospital where 51-year old Tammy Lawrence-Daley of Delaware was being treated, took her testimony and collected evidence from where she said the assault took place. ### ""There is a lot of conjecture about the case, a lot of information that doesn't match some of the statements,"" Durán said. ""We have to wait for the investigation to end."" ### The resort where Lawrence-Daley was staying, the Majestic Elegance Punta Cana, has said it will wait another day before commenting on the case. ### Lawrence-Daley posted this week on Facebook about the attack in the thriving Dominican tourist area of Punta Cana, showing grisly pictures of the damage done to her face. She said she had been vacationing with her husband and a couple of friends. ### During the assault in a maintenance area of the beachfront resort, her mouth was ripped apart, requiring numerous stitches, she said. One tooth was knocked out and others were pushed out of position, she said. Her nose was broken in several places and she sustained an orbital fracture. There were teeth marks on her hip. ### In a phone interview with The Associated Press, the mother of two teenage boys said she decided to go public with her story now to help other women and perhaps warn Caribbean tourists about what to expect from resort management in the wake of a similar attack on their properties. ### Lawrence-Daley, an insurance company employee in Wilmington, said she arrived at the Majestic Elegance resort in January. On her second night there, she said she walked alone through a rotunda on the property at about 10:30 p.m. intending to take some pictures of the moon over the water and perhaps grab a snack. She was attacked from behind, her assailant starting to choke her before dragging her into a nearby maintenance room. ### ""The only opportunity I got to turn was when he was strangling me. And that's when I saw the uniform. And when I tried to look up I couldn't just because I was passing out at that point,"" she said in the phone interview. ### She said any conscious moments that followed she was unable to make out the assailant's face because she had already been so savagely beaten that her eyes were swollen shut. But she's positive that her attacker was wearing a uniform with the resort's name embroidered on it. ""He was definitely wearing a uniform of the resort,"" she said. ### Even after a hospital stay in the Dominican Republic, Lawrence-Daley said she's still not positive if she was sexually assaulted. ### ""We had to force them to do a rape kit and that didn't happen until 48 hours later. And even at that point it was an external swab, that was it,"" she said. ### Just as she was starting her long path toward a physical recovery, she said she was told that Dominican authorities would not investigate her assault unless she testified in a local court. She said she managed to testify at a court before flying back home. ### But after a three-month investigation and a failed attempt to negotiate an out-of-court settlement, the resort's insurance company eventually sent a letter saying Majestic Elegance bore no responsibility since she couldn't identify her assailant as an employee. She now has until late July to find a Dominican lawyer to take up the case. ### During her ordeal, her husband and friends went to the resort's front desk three times before security would agree to make even the most cursory search for her, she said, suggesting that she was drunk and sleeping it off somewhere. Relatively speaking, violent crime rarely affects vacationers in the Caribbean, where high violent crime rates typically impact locals and fragile economies are hugely dependent on tourism. But every year, a smattering of high-profile attacks on tourists sends ripples through the regional hospitality industry. ### Regardless of what happens, she hopes her story can lead to some kind of positive change. ### ""If they install cameras that's at least one step closer to really helping people,"" she said. ### ----",060119,1,"She said any conscious moments that followed she was unable to make out the assailant's face because she had already been so savagely beaten that her eyes were swollen shut.

68494,"By TIM REYNOLDS ### AP Basketball Writer ### TORONTO  (AP)   The NBA correctly anticipated that television ratings would dip for Game 1 of the NBA Finals, for two very important reasons. ### There's no LeBron James . ### And Canadian numbers don't count. ### ESPN said Friday that the Game 1 of the Toronto-Golden State series drew a 10.1 overnight rating, the lowest for Game 1 of a title series in a decade - though all the numbers come with a serious catch. Canadian viewership does not count toward the metered-market ratings formula used in the U.S., and it was the most-watched NBA game in Canada's history. ### ""Put aside perception, there is the actuality of the ratings,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Friday. ""Of course, I pay a lot of attention to those. I also pay a lot of attention to the numbers in Canada, where we set an all-time record for viewership. In the U.S., I recognize it's a changing television marketplace.

49290,"Salonen: AP Stylebook could use refresher on abortion ### By Roxane Salonen / Forum News Service Today  at 6:00 a.m. ### Roxane Salonen ### FARGO — Words matter, and as the abortion debate continues to intensify, the pro-life community has been expressing its grievances about how it’s being represented — or misrepresented — by mainstream media. ### Until this changes, many pro-lifers will continue feeling alienated from the media and find it unreliable. If the media won’t even use the terms the pro-life community uses to describe itself, how will it ever trust the stories it tells, which are promised to be unbiased? ### Case in point: If I were to abide by the AP Stylebook used by most American newsrooms for uniformity in conveying ideas, I would have to change “pro-life” in this column to “anti-abortion.” ### There’s a problem already, since not all pro-life activity focuses on abortion, and even if it did, “anti-abortion” conjures a judgment too often assumed to be applied to the woman seeking an abortion, making pro-lifers sound unfairly hostile toward the woman herself. ### Rather, we advocate for both the mothers and the babies in their wombs. Yes, I said babies. When did you last hear new parents declare, at seeing their ultrasound, “We’re having a blob of tissues!” No, it’s a baby with a future already in their minds; possibly even a name and nursery. ### The word “anti-abortion,” except in very specific contexts, is a false usage, and sets a visual in the public’s mind that leads to unfair, divisive, even dangerous conclusions. ### Do pro-lifers have a legitimate complaint here by wondering whether the media, if appearing one-sided on this issue, can be trusted with others? As someone who’s part of each group, both trained journalist and pro-life advocate, I do find it a valid concern. ### But to be fair to the media, the pro-life community also should know that journalists, when using the misleading words we cringe at reading, are simply following protocol. The abovementioned stylebook is standard. Any reporter looking up the word “abortion” and how to convey it in news stories and headlines will find this under the “A” chapter: ### “abortion – Use ‘anti-abortion’ instead of ‘pro-life’ and ‘abortion rights’ instead of ‘pro-abortion’ or ‘pro-choice.’ Avoid ‘abortionist,’ which connotes a person who performs clandestine abortions; use a term such as ‘abortion doctor’ or ‘abortion practitioner.’” ### So, there you have it. This is journalistic protocol for abortion stories. And yet, fellow journalists, when I pray in front of our state’s only abortion facility on Wednesdays, I do so as someone wanting to offer hope for another, not as a judging “anti-abortion protester.” ### Maybe most journalists aren’t being intentionally misleading. Maybe the industry just needs to challenge its worn standards on this topic, considering reality rather than assumption. Until then, a whole segment of media consumers may continue to feel severely misrepresented. ### Media, is that really what we want to perpetuate in this nation of freedom? Truth is a big responsibility, after all. All our lives depend on it. ### Additional Articles Recommended by The Dickinson Press",060119,1,"Until this changes, many pro-lifers will continue feeling alienated from the media and find it unreliable.

80290,"10 Awesome Robert Pattinson Movies To Watch Before The Batman ### A unique, stacked filmography you never knew existed. ### eOne Films ### It's official: Robert Pattinson is playing Bruce Wayne in Matt Reeves' upcoming The Batman. ### There are plenty of reasons why this casting is absolutely spot on. The studio has very specifically wanted to go for a younger, more suave Bruce Wayne, and Pattinson is the perfect fit. He's proved his acting ability time and time again as well as a willingness to take risks in his role choices, meaning he'll certainly be putting his all into one of the world's most iconic superheroes. ### But many just can't shake that Twilight appearance, despite his plethora of roles since the series wrapped up almost seven years ago. Pattinson is a serious actor with some of the most ambitious character choices in recent memory, though a lot of his movies have gone under-seen. ### So before going into The Batman with a predisposed decade old perception of Pattinson's skills, here are some movies to check out to change your mind. ### 10. Good Time ### A24 ### If there was a single film to point to to highlight Pattinson's ability as an actor, it would be Good Time. ### Playing the role of a robber trying to break his brother out of jail, Pattinson and his bleach blonde hair take the viewer on a breathtaking exploration of New York City. ### Directed by Benny and Josh Safdie, Pattinson's lead character Connie Nikas is a highly flawed individual, going as far as to manipulate his confidantes and engage in taboo activity to achieve what he wants. The film is gritty, unforgiving and unapologetic, showing the violent and criminal side of what desperation and dedication does to a man. ### This is widely considered to be Pattinson's finest performance as an actor, and while the film wasn't wildly successful box office-wise, it's often cited as one of the best films of 2017.",060119,1,"A unique, stacked filmography you never knew existed.###eOne Films###It's official: Robert Pattinson is playing Bruce Wayne in Matt Reeves' upcoming The Batman.###There are plenty of reasons why this casting is absolutely spot on.

57728,"Use revision control to create multiple revisions of a plan and approve the revisions as appropriate. ### Determine sample sizes. ### Set inspection intervals using Skip Lot processing. ### Store the collected data in database tables available for export to a SPC system and / or a Business Activity Query report or dashboard. ### Because all of the above are user-defined, the Epicor Enhanced Quality module can be used by any manufacturer. ### Setting Up Inspection Plans ### Epicor’s Enhanced Quality Assurance (EQA) module uses the Epicor Product Configurator as the base for data collection, although a license for the Configurator module is not required. An Inspection Plan is revision-controlled and may be used with multiple specifications. ### The process is as follows: ### Define the attributes for the data you wish to collect what is it you want to measure? ### Create the specifications and assign the attributes. ### For each attribute, define any parameters and pass / fail values, as appropriate. These can be done in the specification or in the Inspection Plan itself. ### Finally, pull all of this together into an Inspection Plan or Calibration Plan. Launch the Product Configurator and bring in the specification and attributes needed in the plan. ### Once the Inspection Plan has been created and approved it can be assigned to a part (for receiving inspection or RMA Processing) or to an operation for in-process inspection. ### Using an Inspection Plan ### In the Inspection Process in the EQA module for a purchase order receipt, the program will recognize when the purchased part has an approved inspection plan and will enable the data collection process. This will start with choosing a sample size; the Product Configurator at this point generates the number of inspection instances to match the sample size and displays the Attributes screens to collect the data. ### In a similar fashion, Epicor recognizes when an inspection plan has been assigned to an operation and will provide the same functionality. In both cases the process generates a Nonconformance for any parts that fail inspection. Inspection personnel can use the Nonconformance to create a Corrective Action as needed. ### Likewise, the collected data can be exported using a Business Activity Query into a BAQ Report or dashboard to display statistics by part and attribute, such as Mean and Standard Deviation, and to create an X-bar Control Chart to display sample statistics for process control purposes. Crystal Reports or the SQL Server Report Service (SSRS) are excellent reporting tools to display the control chart. ### Skip Lot Processing ### One of the more robust features of the Enhanced Quality Assurance module is the ability to determine the inspection interval for a purchased part to allow receipts of the part to bypass receiving inspection based on past quality results. This is done by defining a Skip Lot Code, which specifies the number of lots to be inspected, the number of lots to be skipped between inspections, and the repeat cycle. Users will define multiple skip lot codes to be used based on inspection results. ### For example, a user may decide to inspect two lots of a part and then skip the next three lots if the first two pass inspection, and to repeat this process for a total of three cycles. If the supplier delivers lots that pass inspection for all of the cycles, then Epicor will automatically change the inspection occurrences to another Skip Lot Code that the user has assigned, such as skipping eight lots and inspecting two. If any lots fail inspection then Epicor will likewise assign a different Skip Lot Code for more intensive inspection. ### What Can I Expect from EQA? ### You cannot expect to build and ship high quality parts without knowledge of your manufacturing processes, and EQA provides this knowledge regarding the incidence of defects and where these defects are occurring. As you may have inferred from the above, this module requires significant setup to define the inspection attributes and then use them in specifications and inspection plans. EQA provides a means of gathering production data and storing the data in a format readily available for analysis through SPC software or user-written reports and dashboards, allowing you to see what is going on in your shop floor. ### If you believe Epicor’s Enhanced Quality Assurance module is right for you, contact Tomerlin-ERP today.

""It is frustrating, but we knew the risks were big when I and my mates decided to come."" ### Brazilian tourist Alfredo Nunes says he paid 3,000 euros for a VIP ticket he gave to his son. ### ""If I find another ticket for a price that is not outrageous I will buy it, but it is impossible not to feel sorry for those that support the teams that are in the final but won't be able to get in,"" Nunesa said. ""I saw the 2016 final at the San Siro, prices were not this absurd then."" ### ___ ### 8 p.m. ### Roberto Firmino will start for Liverpool and Harry Kane is back for Tottenham in the Champions League final lineups. ### Firmino missed the last three matches because of a thigh problem. He hadn't played since the team's loss to Barcelona in the first leg of the semifinals. ### Divock Origi, who had been playing in attack in the absence of Firmino and Mohamed Salah, is back on the bench. ### Salah, who missed the second leg of the semifinals because of a concussion, is set to start as well. The Egyptian forward had to be replaced before halftime of last year's final against Real Madrid because of a shoulder injury. ### Kane hasn't played for Tottenham since injuring his left ankle in April during the quarterfinal against Manchester City. He missed the semifinal against Ajax and was a doubt for the final. ### Lucas Moura, who scored three goals to power Spurs past Ajax, was on the bench. ### The lineups: ### Liverpool: Alisson Becker, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joel Matip, Virgil Van Dijk, Andy Robertson, Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum, Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino. ### Tottenham: Hugo Lloris, Kieran Trippier, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen, Danny Rose, Harry Winks, Moussa Sissoko, Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli, Heung-Min Son, Harry Kane (captain). ### ___ ### 6:55 p.m. ### Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris can become the first player in 45 years to lift the Champions League trophy after also winning the World Cup as a captain. ### Franz Beckenbauer was the last player to do that, back in 1974, when he won the European Cup with Bayern Munich and then the World Cup with West Germany the same year. ### Lloris won the World Cup with France in Russia last year. ### ___ ### 5:45 p.m. ### The Champions League says a moment of silence will be held in memory of former Spain midfielder José Antonio Reyes before the final kicks off. ### Reyes was killed early Saturday in a traffic accident in Spain. He was 35. ### ""UEFA and European football are deeply saddened by the terrible news that José Antonio Reyes has passed away today and I would like to express my sincerest condolences to his family and loved ones for their loss,"" UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin said. ### UEFA says Reyes is the only player to have won the Europa League five times, with Sevilla and Atletico Madrid. ### Reyes also won the English Premier League with Arsenal, and a Spanish league with Real Madrid. ### Last season he played in Spain's second division. ### ___ ### 3 p.m. ### Thousands of Liverpool and Tottenham fans are gathering under the sunny and clear skies in Madrid hours before their teams face off in the all-English Champions League final. ### More than 30,000 English fans are expected to travel to watch the final at the 68,000-capacity Metropolitano Stadium. Liverpool and Tottenham were each allocated nearly 17,000 tickets, but Spanish authorities expect many thousands more to make the trip. ### ""I came out here. I flew on my own, I do not have a ticket,"" said Liverpool fan Frank O'Leary. ""I just came to be with all the beautiful Reds fans and sing my heart out and watch the game in a bar.3/8 ### Hundreds of mostly Red-clad Liverpool fans also arrived by train from as far away as Barcelona on Spain's eastern coast early on Saturday. Available hotel rooms are practically non-existent. Weeks before the final the few rooms remaining were running for over a thousand euros. ### More than 4,700 security personnel are being deployed by Spanish authorities in what they say are unprecedented measures to guarantee safety at the sporting event. ### ___ ### 9:05 a.m. ### Liverpool is looking to become European champion for a sixth time and Tottenham is chasing glory for the first time. ### Tens of thousands of English fans are descending on Madrid for the first all-English Champions League final in 11 years on Saturday. ### Tottenham and Liverpool didn't make it to Madrid the easy way on the field. Both had to overcome 3-0 deficits in their Champions League semifinals, with Liverpool stunning Barcelona and Tottenham defeating Ajax with almost the last kick of the second leg. ### Tottenham hasn't reached any continental final since winning the now-defunct UEFA Cup in 1984. And this season has been only the north London club's sixth appearance in the European Cup — with five qualifications coming since 2010. ### Liverpool is England's most successful side in the European Cup, lifting the trophy five times — most recently in 2005. But the Merseyside club lost the 2007 final and again last year to Real Madrid. ### That was the sixth successive final Juergen Klopp has lost, with the Liverpool manager yet to win a trophy since joining the team in 2015. The team only missed out on a first English title since 1990 when Manchester City defended its title by one-point. ### ___ ### CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Skulls are Entelognathus (above) and Kenicthys (below). ### Dicksonosteus arcticus (Goujet 1975; Early Devonian) is basal to the jawless placoderms, Bothriolepis and Romundia, as well as the larger jawed predators, Coccosteus, Mcnamarapsis and Dunkleosteus. Like other basal taxa, it wide and flat. ### Bothriolepis canadensis (Eichwald 1840; Late Devonian; typically 30cm, up to 100cm in length) is a jawless placoderm with a tall skull and armored pectoral fins. The postfrontal makes up most of the cheek region. The intertemporal, supratemporal and tabular are vertical. | ### Romundina stellina (Ørvig 1975; Early Silurian; 20 cm long) is another jawless placoderm in which the premaxilla and maxilla are fused to become a large disc. ### Austroptycodus gardener (Long 1997; Late Devonian) is a placoderm with reduced skull bones producing a lateral temporal fenestra, as in certain ray-fin fish. ### References ### Ahlberg P, Trinajstic K, Johanson Z and Long J 2009. Pelvic claspers confirm chondrichthyan-like internal fertilization in arthrodires.

(WWBT) - Virginia Beach police confirmed 12 people were killed in the shooting at the municipal center Friday. ### The shootings happened at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center Friday. (Source: WWBT) ### Officials are expected to hold another press conference with updates at 3 p.m. ### “This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,"" Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer said. ### A police officer was among the wounded following a shootout with the suspect. Virginia Beach Police Chief Jim Cervera said the officer “was saved by his bulletproof vest."" ### Police said 11 people died at the scene and one died on the way to the hospital. Four more are wounded and were in surgery at area hospitals. Their conditions are not known. ### Police said all but one of the victims were public utilities employees. Police have identified the victims as Laquita Brown, Tara Gallagher, Mary Gayle, Alexander Gusev, Katherine Nixon, Richard Nettleton, Christopher Rapp, Ryan Cox, Joshua Hardy, Michelle Langer, Robert Williams and Herbert Snelling. ### Cervera said the shooter was a long-time public utilities employee who fired indiscriminately, but he would not comment on a motive. ### Police recovered a .45-caliber handgun with multiple extended magazines and a suppressor. ### Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam traveled to Virginia Beach and said the shooting was “unspeakable, senseless violence."" ### “This is a horrific day for the Commonwealth of Virginia,"" Northam said in a statement. “My deepest condolences and prayers go to the families of those who left home this morning, and will not return tonight, as well as those who have been injured in this tragedy. This is unspeakable, senseless violence. I commend local and state law enforcement, first responders, medical teams, and all others who acted swiftly to respond to this situation. My thoughts continue to be with the victims and their families.” ### The shooting started outside the municipal building and continued inside on all three floors. ### The suspect has been identified as 40-year-old DeWayne Craddock, a longtime employee in the city’s public utilities department. Cervera said they would only mention Craddock’s name one time, then forever refer to him as “the suspect.” ### “Our focus now is the dignity and respect of the victims,” Cervera said. ### Sen. Tim Kaine said he was in Virginia Beach earlier Friday. ### “I’m devastated to learn of the tragic shooting tonight in Virginia Beach. My heart is with everyone who lost a loved one, and I’m praying for a swift recovery for all those who have been injured,"" Kaine said. ### In a later statement, Kaine, a former Virginia governor, called on Congress to address the “daily scourge” of gun violence. ### “I am heartbroken by the horrific shooting today in Virginia Beach. My prayers are with all who have been affected, and I want Virginians to know I will keep pushing for Congress to take action to prevent the daily scourge of gun violence in America,"" Kaine said. “I was just in Virginia Beach this morning. It’s such a strong and beautiful community, and the bravery of the first responders today is a testament to that. My heart aches to see it devastated by yet another gun violence tragedy.” ### In Virginia, guns are not prohibited in public buildings, with the exception of schools and courthouses. ### “Life doesn’t have to be this way, and it shouldn’t be this way,” Attorney General Mark Herring said. “In recent years there have been mass shootings at American elementary schools, colleges, government buildings, offices, concerts, movie theaters, nightclubs, even churches, mosques, and synagogues. We have to do more to stop this kind of violence.” ### Copyright 2019 WWBT.

79400,"Principal Real Estate Income Fund ### news 20 hours ago The Associated Press ### DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 31, 2019-- ### The Principal Real Estate Income Fund (NYSE:PGZ) announces the sources of a distribution paid on May 31, 2019 of $0.11 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 17, 2019, pursuant to the Fund's managed distribution plan. This press release is issued as required by an exemptive order granted to the Fund by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and includes the notice below sent to shareholders regarding the source of the distribution. ### Statement Pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ### The following table sets forth the estimated amount of the sources of distribution for purposes of Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the related rules adopted thereunder. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Fund estimates the following percentages, of the total distribution amount per share, attributable to (i) current and prior fiscal year net investment income, (ii) net realized short-term capital gain, (iii) net realized long-term capital gain and (iv) return of capital or other capital source as a percentage of the total distribution amount. These percentages are disclosed for the current distribution as well as the fiscal year-to-date cumulative distribution amount per share for the Fund. ###  ### Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gain ### 0.01270 ### Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gain ### 0.00000 ### Return of Capital or other Capital Source ### 0.00000 ### Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gain ### 0.01270 ### Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gain ### 0.00000 ### Return of Capital or other Capital Source ### 0.11990 ### % ###  ### The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income.' ### The timing and character of distributions for federal income tax purposes are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP. As such, all or a portion of this distribution may be reportable as taxable income on your 2019 federal income tax return. The final tax character of any distribution declared in 2019 will be determined in January 2020 and reported to you on IRS Form 1099-DIV. ### The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and not for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. ### Presented below are return figures, based on the change in the Fund’s Net Asset Value per share (“NAV”), compared to the annualized distribution rate for this current distribution as a percentage of the NAV on the last day of the month prior to distribution record date. ### Fund Performance & Distribution Information ### % ### ^ Based on the Fund’s NAV as of April 30, 2019. ### * Cumulative fiscal year-to-date return is based on the change in NAV including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of these distributions for the period November 1, 2018 through April 30, 2019. ### ** The 5 year average annual total return is based on change in NAV including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of these distributions and is through the last business day of the month prior to the month of the current distribution record date. ### While the NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund’s investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder’s investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder’s investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund’s market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund’s shares in the open market. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Managed Distribution Plan. ### Furthermore, the Board of Trustees reviews the amount of any potential distribution and the income, capital gain or capital available. The Board of Trustees will continue to monitor the Fund’s distribution level, taking into consideration the Fund’s net asset value and the financial market environment. The Fund’s distribution policy is subject to modification by the Board of Trustees at any time. The distribution rate should not be considered the dividend yield or total return on an investment in the Fund. ### Please retain this document for your records. ### ALPS Advisors, Inc. is the investment adviser to the Fund. ### Principal Real Estate Investors LLC is the investment sub-adviser to the Fund.

It’s good for people who think they may be lactose intolerant, she said. ### When Miss Renaud is not fulfilling the duties of the Dairy Princess, she likes to show cows and ride horses. She enjoys traveling and often does so to go to cow shows even when she is not competing. ### “There is always something you can learn,” she said about attending cow shows. ### Hundreds of people lined Main Street in the earlier afternoon to witness the annual parade. ### In addition to the Dairy Princess court, there were gleaming fire trucks, beaming Cub Scouts, majestic horse teams and costumed characters to entertain the throng. ### At the park, the festival was in full swing all day with frog jumping contests, a dunking booth, a cakewalk and tons of locally made goods for sale. ### Commenting rules: ### Stick to the topic of the article/letter/editorial.

Is Dagger SB worth buying or should I buy BDylan, RYanbo, BPuggi first? ### Reply ### 2 points · 5 days ago ### 1.Generally,this team can be used in mob heavy stage to make full use of Golemwalt passive,but it's very bad against counter enemy,especially if that enemy deal heavy dmg per counter,also it relies heavily on Lisa SB 2o,so it can be fatal if you don't have 2o at the exact moment you need it. ### 2.Sophie is quite wonky to build team around her since she deal all kind of dmg,making her dmg a bit inconsistent,still her 4o can potentially deal one of the highest dmg in the game,so you have to make full use of that.Right now decent team for her is the iconic black team and the Sherlock + Lisa SP team,the former make full use of her 4o,while the latter allow her to spam her skill more,while Sherlock give enhance to her after turn 2,assuming you use her skill first turn. ### 3.Dagger SB is basically a time machine bear,he can cheese some stage by spamming  1o over and over,but it's kinda situational as you have many faster opinion,like Dylan SB and Puggi SB combo,this make the aforementioned black team that can blow through majority of content,minus some high end venture quest.Dylan SB is more useful generally so you should buy him first,then Puggi SB to complete the team.Yanbo SB is mostly used in advisor slot,but he's not so good anymore since auto trigger skill is so common now and not restrictive like him. ### Wow, thanks for the in-depth analysis :) really helpful. ### Agree. Counter enemies shred this team quite easily. ### I don't have Lisa SP so she's in an awkward situation now. ### Agree. Dylan SB and Puggi SB is a much faster option especially in WT. ### If you don't mind then I have one last question: Which Black character would fit perfectly in a Angelica SSR/Sionne SSR/Jahan Adv team?

It successfully lobbied the U.S. Interior Department to suspend a last-minute Obama-era memo stating that mineral rights under the original Missouri River bed should belong to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, which is also known as the Three Affiliated Tribes. ### The Interior Department put the minerals issue on hold last summer and ordered a review of the ""underlying historical record."" The state maintains that it assumed ownership of the riverbed when North Dakota became a state in 1889, citing a constitutional principle known as the equal footing doctrine. ### The state's immersion in the issue isn't sitting well with tribal members, who say it's between them and the Trump administration. ### ""They obviously didn't care that much before,"" the tribal chairman, Mark Fox, recently told The Associated Press. ""Now that there might be $100 million there, all of a sudden the state really cares, right?"" ### The January 2017 memo by former Interior Department Solicitor Hilary Tompkins, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, is one of numerous federal declarations since the 1820s that have confirmed the tribes' ownership of the river, which was altered when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Garrison Dam in the 1950s and created Lake Sakakawea. ### In her ruling, Tompkins cited both a 1936 opinion by the Interior Department that granted the tribes ownership of a Missouri River island and a wider-ranging 1979 conclusion by the Interior Board of Land Appeals that the entire bed of the river within the reservation boundaries didn't pass to North Dakota's control when it became a state. The state didn't appeal the 1979 decision, which Tompkins said rejected the relevance of the equal footing doctrine. ### Tribal officials have recently taken to social media and penned op-eds asking state leaders to come out in support of the tribes' ownership rights, much like they did during the last legislative session regarding an oil and tax agreement with the tribes. ### ""I hope our elected officials will join us once again in supporting our lawful property rights to the minerals under the Missouri River on the Fort Berthold Reservation,"" Fox wrote in an op-ed kicking off the campaign. ### The opinion by Tompkins, who said her conclusions are backed by a 2001 Supreme Court opinion giving an Idaho tribe ownership of submerged lands, came out two days before President Donald Trump's inauguration. Although Trump held a meeting later that year to pledge his support to Native American leaders in oil country, including Fox, state government officials in Republican-dominated North Dakota have found receptive ears at the Interior Department. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### State Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem wrote a letter in October 2017 to James Cason, associate deputy secretary in the Interior Department and longtime conservative operative, stating that the Tompkins opinion has flaws and asking that it be withdrawn or suspended. ""I wholeheartedly support a 're-set' and encourage discussions that have as their objective an amicable resolution to the title question,"" Stenehjem wrote. ### Principal Deputy Solicitor Daniel Jorjani complied with that request in June 2018, after which the National Congress of American Indians passed a resolution urging the Interior Department to complete title and mapping work of the riverbed and scrap Jorjani's opinion. ### Subscribe to Breaking News ### Sign up!  ### Stenehjem told the AP that Fox's op-ed focusing on strong relationships between tribal and state governments should be a ""means to resolve any of these issues."" Asked if that meant sharing some of the royalties, the attorney general said, ""Conceivably, yes."" He added that those conversations would go through Republican Gov. Doug Burgum. ### Burgum's spokesman, Mike Nowatzki, said in a statement that Burgum is committed to partnering and engaging in productive dialogue with ""all tribal nations for the benefit of all North Dakotans,"" but added that any public statements on the riverbed minerals issue would be premature. The Interior Department did not respond to requests for comment. ### Fox said tribal elders have told him to ""fight and fight hard for what our people died for over hundreds of years."" He said he believes it's his responsibility to right some of the wrongs, including ""one of the greatest devastating blows to our people,"" the construction of Garrison Dam. ### ""We have a connection to the river that goes back thousands of years,"" Fox said. ""It's not just cultural, it's not only spiritual, it has also historically been our economic foundation of who we are."" ### Fox said the tribes have spent their oil money wisely. He cited a new courthouse, $130 million worth of road repairs, construction of more than 400 homes, a new drug treatment facility, health insurance for 7,000 enrolled members, improvements in law enforcement, a $20 million education fund for students, and $200 million in infrastructure upgrades, among other things. ### Tribal elder Austin Gillette, 72, who was in first grade when his town of Elbowoods was flooded out by Lake Sakakawea, and 90 percent of reservation residents were forced to relocate, remembers it as the first time he saw adults cry. ### ""Water is life,"" said Gillette, a former tribal chairman and council member.

76290,"Time for Summer Toys ... and Safety ### Share Article ### During National Safety Month in June, experts at Scepter remind people that it’s essential to take safe steps when dealing with portable fuel containers. Whether gassing up a dirt bike, ATV or motorcycle, always use a reliable fuel container, such as the Scepter SmartControl with a Flame Mitigation Device (FMD). ### Scepter SmartControl gas cans can be used to safely fuel up motorcycles and other summer activity vehicles. ### While the warmer weather brings a ‘get out and go’ mentality for many people, it’s important to do so safely. ### MIAMI, Okla. (PRWEB) June 01, 2019 ### Gas up the motorcycles. Fuel up the water toys. Get the dirt bikes and ATVs ready to hit the road. Summer is the time for outdoor activities that rely on both fuel and common sense. ### “Safety should always be top-of-mind for anyone using a motorized vehicle,” says Dan Marshall, vice president of marketing and business development with Scepter . “While the warmer weather brings a ‘get out and go’ mentality for many people, it’s important to do so safely.” ### During National Safety Month in June, Marshall reminds people that it’s essential to take safe steps when dealing with portable fuel containers. “Whether you’re gassing up the boat, taking a jet ski out on the lake, or filling up the lantern at a campsite, everyone needs to practice safe steps when dealing with any type of fuel,” says Marshall. ### Staying Safe: Selecting a Reliable Fuel Container ### One way to stay on the safe side of refueling efforts is to make sure your fuel container has a Flame Mitigation Device (FMD), like the ScepterTM SmartControlTM fuel containers. While it is never safe to have gasoline around fire or an ignition source, it makes sense to have additional protection against potential misuse or accidental exposure to a spark or hot engine. ### FMDs help to avoid the transmission of a flame into a container and then igniting flammable vapor inside the container. The FMD improves the ability of the container to safely and effectively function for the user and meet the other standards applicable to portable fuel containers. ### The durable gas, diesel and propane SmartControl containers feature a unique push spout for fast pours without spills. With a single motion, the user simply presses the lever up to unlock the child safety feature with the palm of the hand, and then squeezes the large button. The first squeeze is done when upright to vent the container. Then, the nozzle gets placed over the tank. A second squeeze allows users to pour just the right amount of fuel. A video showing proper filling and use of Scepter fuel containers is available on the company’s website. ### 5 Fast Safety Tips ### Fuel containers should be handled seriously, keeping in mind the risks associated with invisible fuel vapors. The team at Scepter offers these safety tips for making sure fuel and fuel containers are properly used by consumers throughout the year: ### Tip #1 – Never use gasoline or diesel to start a fire or ignite barbeques. This includes bonfires, burning leaves and outdoor campsite grills. Using fuel around any type of fire can result in a life threatening situation. ### Tip #2 – Fuel should not be used to clean grease or glue off of any surface. ### Tip #3 – Always turn off an engine and let it cool down before refueling (never add fuel while the engine is running). Gasoline can be ignited by a hot muffler. ### Tip #4 – Never remove the FMD from a fuel container. ### Tip #5 – Store portable fuel containers in secure, dry locations away from heat sources. ### Seasonal Checks on Fuel Containers ### Marshall stresses that consumers should check to make sure fuel cans stored over the winter months are still in good shape for summer activities. Plus, “winter fuel” should safely be replaced with “summer fuel” for activities during warmer weather. Now is also the ideal time to make sure the fuel container itself is in good shape to handle all your summer needs. ### “Older metal containers can leak both fuel and fumes, which are a danger wherever they’re stored,” says Marshall. “You don’t want even the slightest spill of fuel in an area where a pet can unknowingly lick it up, or a container without a child safety cap if there are children in the family.” ### Available in one-, two- and five-gallon sizes, the SmartControl product line is designed to substantially exceed ASTM and CPSC minimum standards. ### Recognized by This Old House magazine as a “Top 20 Best New Product of 2019” in the Lawn & Garden category, SmartControl containers are also the recipient of the “Best in Class” Award at the 2018 National Hardware Show. Constructed in the U.S.A. of durable and safe high-density polyethylene, SmartControl containers can be found throughout the U.S. in The Home Depot®, Walmart®, Lowe’s®, AutoZone®, Pep Boys, Target and Northern® Tool + Equipment stores.

1227,"Fisher’s homer leads Astros past Athletics 3-2 ### By ### June 1, 2019 ### 9 ### OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — With several key stars sidelined by injuries, the Houston Astros relied on some lesser-known fill-ins who were in the minors just a week ago. ### Derek Fisher hit a tiebreaking homer to lead off the eighth inning after pinch-runner Myles Straw and defensive replacement Jack Mayfield made key plays in the seventh to help the short-handed Astros rallied for a 3-2 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Friday night. ### “They’re doing everything they can to make good impressions,” manager A.J. Hinch said. “They’re really happy to be in the big leagues. There’s a lot of talent in this organization. We built that depth. It’s coming in handy now.” ### The Astros trailed the A’s 2-0 heading into the seventh inning on a night they were missing injured stars Jose Altuvé, Carlos Correa and George Springer. But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. ### That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A’s their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. ### “I knew I hit it hard,” Fisher said. “I know Ramón (Laureano) tends to pull some crazy plays out of nowhere. Thankfully the ball didn’t find a glove, and even better, it went over the wall.” ### Héctor Rondón (3-1) pitched out of a jam in the seventh with help from a diving stop at shortstop by Mayfield that held Laureano at third base with the infield drawn in. Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. ### Brad Peacock allowed just one run in his previous four starts and pitched around a little bit of trouble in the first two innings. But the A’s got to him in the third, ending a stretch of 14 straight scoreless innings. ### Robbie Grossman hit an opposite-field single away from the shift with one out and Chapman followed with a no-doubt shot to left field on a 0-2 fastball right down middle. The A’s didn’t manage anything else against Peacock, who allowed two runs and five hits in six innings. ### Houston then tied it in the seventh against Mike Fiers. Josh Reddick snapped an 0-for-15 rut with a solo homer with one out to make it 2-1 and Fiers was replaced by Lou Trevino after issuing a two-out walk to Tyler White. Kemp then hit a drive to left that Grossman took a bad angle on, sending Straw home on an RBI double that tied the game. ### “We’re not worried, but these games, we’ve got to lock down, especially late in the game against a team like that,” Fiers said. “We can’t give them too much. It’s a tight game. If we want to win the division, we have to win these games.” ### TRAINER’S ROOM ### Astros: Correa reported to the ballpark in Houston, but is unable to do any work since cracking rib earlier this week. Correa said he was injured while getting a massage at his home Tuesday. He released a video on the YouTube channel of his fiancée, Daniella Rodriguez, on Friday, detailing how the injury occurred and thanking fans for their support. … Altuve (left hamstring) took grounders before the game; INF Aledmys Díaz (hamstring) and Springer (hamstring) both ran and took some swings; and RHP Joe Smith (Achilles) threw a 20-pitch live BP session at West Palm Beach. ### Athletics: OF Khris Davis (left hip) took BP before the game and could be activated as soon as Saturday. “I think there’s a chance,” manager Bob Melvin said. “We want to make sure he’s not sore tomorrow and feels as good as he did today.” ### ROUGH PATCH ### One game after allowing five runs in the 11th inning of a loss to the Angels, Trivino gave up the late lead to the Astros when he couldn’t keep the lead in the seventh. Melvin isn’t worried about one of his most trusted relievers. ### “Just a couple balls in the middle of the plate,” he said. “He’s still throwing hard, still getting good movement, just maybe not precise on the location of where he’s throwing.” ### UP NEXT ### Justin Verlander (8-2, 2.38 ERA), who is tied for second in the majors in wins, gets the start in the middle game of the series for Houston against Brett Anderson (6-3, 3.86 ERA). ### __",060119,1,"June 1, 2019###9###OAKLAND, Calif.

(AP) — Nick Foles walked off the practice field, paused briefly to take off his jersey and started sprinted to the locker room. He wanted to get home as quickly as possible. ### Foles spent the last two days practicing with the Jacksonville Jaguars and trying to recover from a gut-wrenching personal loss. ### Foles' wife, Tori, had a miscarriage last weekend. Foles spoke publicly for the first time following organized team activities Friday and said his wife urged him to return sooner than many expected. ### ""She knows how important family is to me, but she also wanted me to be here to be with the team,"" Foles said. ""It was really up to her, and she wanted me to come here and be with the team for a little bit. ... ### ""If my wife needed me at home right now, I'd be at home. That's just me being honest."" ### Tori Foles was 15 weeks pregnant with the couple's second child when she went into sudden labor Sunday and knew something was wrong. She later found out she had an infection of pneumonia in her blood that caused her to go into premature labor and endure a full delivery. ### ""I know there are a lot of people that go through this,"" Nick Foles said. ""It's difficult. It's really difficult. It will always be emotional, but ultimately we trust the Lord in this process. We get home to our beautiful baby girl and we hug her even tighter. ... Tori's going through a lot right now. I'm here. The team's been awesome, but when I'm done here, get home to them so we can continue to heal with one another."" ### Foles raved about his wife's resilience. A volleyball player at Arizona, Tori Foles was out of college and working at Nike in 2013 when she was diagnosed with dysautonomia, which affects blood flow through the body and often causes lightheadedness, fainting, blurred vision and an increased heartbeat when standing up. There is no cure. ### ""She was bedridden, hospitals,"" he said. ""She battles that every single day. Obviously, we've gone so much these last couple of years. We're going through this now. But she's so strong. She's unbelievable."" ### Tori returned home earlier this week and is taking antibiotics to fight the infection. She is getting help from family members and friends, which helped make it easier for Nick to leave the house, attend practices and continue installing the team's new offense. ### ""She's the one who said, 'Go, the team needs you right now,'"" he said. ""She knows I'm coming home right away. So that's her. It really is as simple as that. ... It's never going to be, 'Poor me' or anything. It's never that way. She goes through something every day with a chronic illness and she's never going to do that. She's tough. She fights through everything. ### ""Right now she's continuing to do what she can. She probably moves around too much right now. I know she's going through so many emotions, but that's something we get to go through, and in our relationship and our marriage. It allows us to grow closer and closer together."" ### ———",060119,1,""" She knows how important family is to me, but she also wanted me to be here to be with the team,"" Foles said.

Lawmakers in 45 states have been debating at least 647 bills that would expand voting access, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU's School of Law. That's compared to lawmakers in 28 states that have considered at least 82 bills to restrict access. ### Voting-related topics under consideration in legislatures this year: ### EARLY VOTING ### Most states and the District of Columbia allow registered voters to cast ballots in person before Election Day. This year, lawmakers in New York and Delaware approved early voting in those states. An effort to allow voters in Connecticut to decide whether that state should have early voting did not receive enough support from legislators to make the ballot next year. ### Bills that would allow early voting or put the question before voters also were introduced in Maine, Minnesota, Missouri and Virginia. ### ——— ### NO-EXCUSE ABSENTEE VOTING ### While absentee ballots are available in every state, 19 states require a voter to provide a reason for requesting one. This year, bills that would allow some form of no-excuse absentee voting or put the question before voters were introduced in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Missouri, New Hampshire and New York. ### ——— ### SAME-DAY AND ELECTION DAY REGISTRATION ### A growing number of states allow people to register and vote on the same day. In most cases, this applies to the early voting period as well as Election Day. Proof of residency and identification are required. States check whether a voter has already cast a ballot and have criminal penalties to deter fraud. ### This year, bills that would allow for same-day voter registration or to put the question before voters were introduced in Connecticut, Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico and New York. ### ——— ### AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION ### Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have started or have plans to implement a system in which residents are automatically registered to vote when they have contact with the state, typically at the state's motor vehicle agency, unless they decline. ### This year, bills that would implement automatic voter registration were introduced in Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska and New Hampshire. ### ——— ### REGISTRATION ASSISTANCE ### Republicans in some states have expressed concerns about the actions of third-party voter registration groups, specifically pointing to the burden on local election officials when the groups submit forms that are incomplete or contain false information. ### In Tennessee, this prompted a law signed recently by Republican Gov. Bill Lee that allows for fines for 100 or more incomplete registration forms in a year. A similar measure was introduced in Arizona. ### ——— ### VOTER IDENTIFICATION ### Seven states have what has been described as ""strict"" photo identification requirements, meaning a voter must show a photo ID prior to casting a ballot. In those states, people who do not have an acceptable form of photo ID are directed to cast a provisional ballot that will be counted only if the voter visits the appropriate election office to present their ID within a certain number of days. ### Ten other states have ""non-strict"" photo identification requirements. Depending on the state, some voters may have the option to sign an affidavit, or poll workers can vouch for their identity. In other cases, voters are directed to cast a provisional ballot, and then election officials determine eligibility without further action required of the voter. ### Efforts to implement photo ID requirements in Montana and Wyoming failed this year. ### ——— ### Sources: National Conference of State Legislatures and the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU's School of Law. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Tyler Tate) ### Tyler Tate ### Orioles' decision with top pick isn't between just two players ### By Jon Meoli The Baltimore Sun ### Jun 1, 2019 ### California first baseman Andrew Vaughn bats during an NCAA college baseball game between the University of California and the University of Utah, Friday, May 5, 2019, in Salt Lake City. (AP Photo/Tyler Tate) ### Tyler Tate ### Save ### Much of the focus ahead of Monday's Major League Baseball draft, and specifically the Baltimore Orioles' first overall pick, is on the consensus top prospects: Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman and Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. ### They’re not the only candidates to possibly go No. 1, though, and the Orioles won't be limiting their top-of-the-board preparations to just those two players. ### Among the leaders in predraft evaluations, including Baseball America, MLB.com , ESPN and FanGraphs, a few players have created a second tier behind that pair. ###  ### Here's a look at some of the other well-regarded players outside the top two who could interest the Orioles : ### First baseman Andrew Vaughn, California ### Even though he lacks the same switch-hitting prowess or defensive value that make Rutschman the total package, the right-handed-hitting Vaughn has all the same offensive attributes that make him appealing to a team looking to add impact to its farm system. ### He was named the nation's top college player in 2018 while hitting .402/.531/.819 with 23 home runs and 63 RBIs as a sophomore, and despite not getting much to hit, is still batting .387/.549/.728 with 15 home runs this year. ### He is considered to have  elite power, according to many public scouting reports, with the ability to drive the ball to all fields without overcommitting and making his swing vulnerable. His bat will carry him to the majors in short order, but as a right-handed hitter with a first base-only defensive profile, he leaves a lot of the boxes blank for a team in search of a transformational No. 1 overall pick. ### Shortstop C.J. Abrams, Blessed Trinity (Ga.) HS ### Witt is at the top of the prep shortstop pile, and so many selected early in the draft from that player pool have gone on to have tremendous careers. Abrams also has many of the traits you'd want from a shortstop taken with such a high pick, but not all of them. ### He's considered an elite runner with good contact skills, but requires refinement at shortstop and has a very valuable fallback position in center field. He'll have to grow into his power as well. For Abrams to get selected No. 1 overall, it would be with the idea of getting him into pro ball and steeping him in some of the modern methods the Orioles want to use to improve players, hoping his athleticism with the right refinement produces an elite player. ### Outfielder Riley Greene, Hagerty (Fla.) HS ### A product of the same high school as Orioles prospect Ryan Mountcastle, Greene comes out of Hagerty with a similar profile: He can really hit. Multiple outlets, including Baseball America and MLB.com , refer to him as the best pure hitter in the draft, with the added bonus that he's a left-handed batter. ### The comparisons with Mountcastle don't exactly end there, though Mountcastle eventually grew into his power in a way scouts hope can happen for Greene. He fits a corner outfield profile, and there doesn't appear to be enough speed for him to play center field. But there's plenty of value in a no-doubt big-league bat, and that's the type of noise that teams are tasked with sorting through to get the best player possible at No. 1. ### Outfielder JJ Bleday, Vanderbilt ### The younger brother of the new High-A Frederick development coach, Adam Bleday, JJ has the type of track record that makes his credentials pretty unimpeachable. ### He carried his strong sophomore year into an impressive showing with wood bats in the Cape Cod League last summer, and broke out from a power standpoint with 26 home runs as a junior. ### Bleday seems to have the arm for right field, but not the range for center field. And if he ends up at a corner spot, the power he's started to show this spring will be useful there. ### Outfielder Hunter Bishop, Arizona State ### Unlike some of the other college players who could be selected early in Monday's first round, Bishop's breakout with the Sun Devils has made him a truly different player — to the point that teams will have little way of gleaning how real it is. He's added more utility to his swing to hit for average and tap into significant raw power, can run and can stick in center field.",060119,1,"He carried his strong sophomore year into an impressive showing with wood bats in the Cape Cod League last summer, and broke out from a power standpoint with 26 home runs as a junior.###Bleday seems to have the arm for right field, but not the range for center field.

Davis took batting practice before the series opener and could be activated from the injured list as early as Saturday after being sidelined since May 22 with a left him injury. Davis might like to get back in time to face Houston ace Justin Verlander (8-2, 2.38 ERA). Davis homered three times in eight at-bats against Verlander last season. Brett Anderson (6-3, 3.86 ERA) starts for Oakland. ### KERSHAW VS. HARPER ### Clayton Kershaw starts for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Philadelphia Phillies in a match-up of first-place teams. The left-hander is 5-0 with a 3.46 ERA and 48 strikeouts this year and 3-5 with a 3.07 ERA in 13 starts against the Phillies. Kershaw will be facing Bryce Harper, who is 2 for 21 with 13 strikeouts against the Dodgers' ace. ### GERMÁN-TOWN ### Yankees right-hander Domingo Germán (9-1, 3.43) leads the majors in wins. He won six straight starts before getting tagged for a career-high seven runs and nine hits, including four homers, over five innings Sunday in a no-decision at Kansas City. ### MILE HIGH WELCOME ### Blue Jays right-hander Marcus Stroman has allowed three earned runs over his last three starts. His 2.74 ERA ranks among the leaders in the American League. On Saturday, he has his work cut out for him when he gets his first experience with hitter friendly Coors Field. The Rockies are hitting .296 at home this season and averaging 6.2 runs. ### LOOKS FAMILIAR ### The Nationals face former teammate Tanner Roark in the second game of their series against the Reds. The Nationals traded Roark for Tanner Rainey in December. Roark hasn't allowed a homer in his last 35 1/3 innings, the second-longest such streak of his career. ### SEVENTH HEAVEN? ### Milwaukee's Brandon Woodruff will try for his seventh straight victory when he faces the Pirates in Pittsburgh. The 26-year-old is 6-0 with a 2.37 ERA over his last eight starts, including a 5-0 mark with a 1.42 ERA in his last five outings. A win would lift Woodruff into a tie with Hyun-Jin Ryu of the Los Angeles Dodgers for tops in the National League. Woodruff is 0-1 in three appearances against the Pirates in his career. ### SOROKA'S START ### Atlanta right-hander Mike Soroka is close to qualifying for the best ERA in the big leagues. The 21-year-old Canadian goes into his start against Detroit with a miniscule 1.07 ERA, having not allowed more than one earned run in any of his eight starts. ### Soroka has pitched 50 2/3 innings, meaning he would need to go a season high 7 1/3 in his ninth start —Atlanta's 58th game— to qualify for the ERA list. Going into Friday's games, Ty Buttrey of the Los Angeles Angels led the big leagues with a 1.27 ERA. Hyun-jin Ryu of the Los Angeles Dodgers had the best mark in the NL at 1.48. ### ———",060119,1,"KD'S RETURN?###The Oakland Athletics are hoping to get injured slugger Khris Davis back in the lineup for the middle game of a series against the first-place Houston Astros.

He faces life in prison without parole if convicted, according to prosecutors. ### Authorities said Cabrera shot Jose “Joe” Cabrera to death near Larkin Valley Road and Buena Vista Drive on March 13, 2006. ### Cabrera was arrested in Mexico on Aug. 1 and returned to the Santa Cruz County Jail early Wednesday. ### A Mexican newspaper reported he was wanted in connection with three Salinas-area murders, but local authorities have not confirmed possible ties to other cases. ### Thursday in court, prosecutor Michael Gilman argued that Cabrera”s bail should be raised from $1.35 million to no bail, in part because he had offered an $80,000 bribe to Mexican authorities to release him. ### He was a commander in the Nuestra Familia gang, Gilman said, and he might be capable of raising 10 percent of the bail amount that would be required for a bond. ### Authorities say he was a regiment leader who collected drug sales payments from cities as far north as Santa Rosa. ### “He has access to a large amount of money just based on his status,” Gilman told Judge Paul Burdick in court. “The court has the authority to deny bail and it should deny bail.” ### Burdick ruled Cabrera would be held without bail at least until Aug. 28, a date he set for a bail hearing. Cabrera must demonstrate his eligibility for any bail amount given the gang allegation, Burdick said. ### He was appointed public defender Ken Azevedo. He did not enter a plea on Thursday. ### Authorities said Cabrera and Jose Cabrera knew each other, but were not related. Santa Cruz County sheriff”s deputies said the two were in Oscar Cabrera”s car before the shooting, and that Cabrera complained to gang leaders that Jose Cabrera had disrespected him. ### Three days after the killing, deputies identified Cabrera as a suspect. He was added to Santa Cruz County”s Most Wanted list on a murder warrant. ### Authorities learned he was living with relatives in Michoacan, Mexico, about two years ago. ### Thursday in court, Cabrera said he was working as a butcher on his family”s property. ### Investigators say Cabrera allegedly organized a meeting of neighborhood Norteño gang leaders at a barbecue near Mount Madonna, at which he asked them to unite and join a larger Watsonville “crew.” ### He is credited with being one of the first Nuestra Familia members to establish direct contacts for his gang to Mexican drug cartels, according to court documents. ### In Mexico, according to court testimony in a 2007 federal prosecution of the gang”s leaders in Salinas, Cabrera briefly lived in Rosarito Beach with one of the gang”s Salinas crew bosses, Robert “Bubba” Hanrahan, who at the time was wanted on Monterey County drug charges. ### The gang in Salinas wired money to Cabrera and Hanrahan in the Mexican states of Sonora, Michoacan and Durango, in part to pay the men”s cellphone bills, which sometimes exceeded $500 a month, according to court exhibits and the testimony of Mario Diaz, a former gang leader from Castroville. ### Cabrera was the “more fruitful” of the two exiles, according to the testimony, because he “was establishing a line of drugs down there.” ### Monterey County Herald staff writer Julia Reynolds contributed to this report. ### Sign up for email newsletters",060119,1,"Investigators say Cabrera allegedly organized a meeting of neighborhood Norteño gang leaders at a barbecue near Mount Madonna, at which he asked them to unite and join a larger Watsonville “crew. ”###He is credited with being one of the first Nuestra Familia members to establish direct contacts for his gang to Mexican drug cartels, according to court documents.###In Mexico, according to court testimony in a 2007 federal prosecution of the gang”s leaders in Salinas, Cabrera briefly lived in Rosarito Beach with one of the gang”s Salinas crew bosses, Robert “Bubba” Hanrahan, who at the time was wanted on Monterey County drug charges.###The gang in Salinas wired money to Cabrera and Hanrahan in the Mexican states of Sonora, Michoacan and Durango, in part to pay the men”s cellphone bills, which sometimes exceeded $500 a month, according to court exhibits and the testimony of Mario Diaz, a former gang leader from Castroville.###Cabrera was the “more fruitful” of the two exiles, according to the testimony, because he “was establishing a line of drugs down there. ”","[33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]","<p>Investigators say Cabrera allegedly organized a meeting of neighborhood Norteño gang leaders at a barbecue near Mount Madonna, at which he asked them to unite and join a larger Watsonville “crew. ”</p><p>He is credited with being one of the first Nuestra Familia members to establish direct contacts for his gang to Mexican drug cartels, according to court documents.</p><p>In Mexico, according to court testimony in a 2007 federal prosecution of the gang”s leaders in Salinas, Cabrera briefly lived in Rosarito Beach with one of the gang”s Salinas crew bosses, Robert “Bubba” Hanrahan, who at the time was wanted on Monterey County drug charges.</p><p>The gang in Salinas wired money to Cabrera and Hanrahan in the Mexican states of Sonora, Michoacan and Durango, in part to pay the men”s cellphone bills, which sometimes exceeded $500 a month, according to court exhibits and the testimony of Mario Diaz, a former gang leader from Castroville.</p><p>Cabrera was the “more fruitful” of the two exiles, according to the testimony, because he “was establishing a line of drugs down there. ”</p>"

Yankees' Brett Gardner and DJ LeMahieu scored on the hit. Associated Press ### New York Yankees starting pitcher J.A.

Associated Press ### New York Yankees catcher Gary Sanchez, left, and relief pitcher Aroldis Chapman congratulate on another after the Yankees defeated the Boston Red Sox 4-1 during a baseball game Friday, May 31, 2019, in New York. Associated Press ### New York Yankees' DJ LeMahieu, right, is greeted near home plate by Luke Voit (45) after hitting a solo home run off Boston Red Sox starting pitcher Chris Sale during the fifth inning of a baseball game Friday, May 31, 2019, in New York. Associated Press ### NEW YORK -- Don't let DJ LeMahieu's professional demeanor fool you. ### ""He's out there to rip your heart out,"" New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, ""and he plays with an edge."" ### A pumped-up LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. ### Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single , and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. ### ""A really good, clean game and probably a game you need to play when you're up against Sale and the Red Sox,"" Boone said. ### Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1Â½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay - and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. ### Rafael Devers homered early for the third-place Red Sox (29-28), who fell 8Â½ games back in the division. That's the furthest they've been behind the Yankees since finishing the 2015 season nine games in the dust. ### ""As much as you can point a finger at anybody in this clubhouse, you can point them at me, too,"" Sale said. ""We've got to find a way to start winning games, get some zip back in us and rolling some wins out. ### ""We just have to find that something. Whatever it is, where it is - change of socks, frozen pizza, I don't know."" ### New York has won 14 of 17 and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. ### After the teams were rained out Thursday night, the Yankees tagged Sale for four runs and seven hits in six innings. The left-hander struck out 10 for a sixth double-digit strikeout game in his past eight starts, but pounded his fist into his glove in frustration after LeMahieu's opposite-field homer in the fifth. ### Batting leadoff, LeMahieu also doubled off the right-center wall in the third and clapped at second base after driving in New York's first run following singles by Gio Urshela and Brett Gardner. ### ""The way the fans are in it, it feels pretty close to the playoffs and you don't get that in too many places,"" said LeMahieu, who made a sprawling defensive play at second base as well. ""It's a big game. Just the atmosphere out there, the rivalry. Just excited."" ### A two-time All-Star, 2016 NL batting champion and winner of three Gold Gloves, LeMahieu left Colorado to sign a $24 million, two-year contract with the Yankees last winter. ### ""I think he does loving playing in this environment,"" Boone said. ""Good to see him go out there and kind of set the tone for us."" ### The 30-year-old Sale entered with a 1.87 ERA versus the Yankees, the lowest mark in the live ball era for any pitcher with at least 100 innings against New York. ### But after signing a $160 million, six-year contract in March, he's tied for the major league lead in losses. ### ""It's not where we want to be. It's not where I want to be. It's not who I am. It's not who I've ever been,"" Sale said. ""I've got to find a way to be better."" ### Happ gave up one run and three hits with five strikeouts in five innings , improving to 9-4 with a 3.00 ERA against Boston. ### Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. ### ""That's the way they drew it up in the offseason and so far, it's working,"" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. ""I know they don't have their big guys, but what they have right now is good. ... They're playing great baseball."" ### BIG MISTAKE ### With two runners on and Andrew Benintendi up, Eduardo NÃºÃ±ez was picked off second base by catcher Gary SÃ¡nchez to end the fifth. ### ""He knows that can't happen. Seems like the last seven, eight days, we've regressed back to being sloppy around the bases,"" Cora said. ""It was a big play in the game."" ### BEAST OF THE EAST ### New York is 17-4 versus AL East opponents, the best mark for any team against its own division. ### TRAINER'S ROOM ### Red Sox: RHP Nathan Eovaldi threw 22 pitches to teammates Brock Holt and Michael Chavis in a simulated game, the first hitters Eovaldi has faced since April 23 surgery to remove a loose body from his right elbow. His next step will be determined Saturday. ... 1B Steve Pearce, the 2018 World Series MVP, was pulled in the second inning with back spasms and replaced by Chavis. Pearce is day to day. ... LHP Eduardo RodrÃ­guez was available out of the bullpen after being rescheduled to start Tuesday in Kansas City. Prior to Thursday night's rainout, RodrÃ­guez (5-3, 5.04 ERA) was slated to start Friday, but the Red Sox simply pushed back Sale instead. ### Yankees: CC Sabathia (right knee inflammation) is set to come off the injured list and start the series finale Sunday night against LHP David Price. ... RHP Dellin Betances (right shoulder impingement) played long toss and said his arm felt good following Thursday's bullpen. His third bullpen is scheduled for Sunday and if that goes well, the next step could be facing hitters. ... Didi Gregorius (Tommy John surgery) went 0 for 5 and played all nine innings at shortstop in a rehab game with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... OF Giancarlo Stanton, sidelined since March 31, is getting close to facing pitching and starting a rehab assignment, Boone said. ### UP NEXT ### Red Sox: RHP Rick Porcello (4-4, 4.41 ERA) is 4-1 with a 2.94 ERA in his last eight starts, and Boston has won seven of them. The 2016 AL Cy Young Award winner, from nearby New Jersey, is 10-8 with a 3.11 ERA in 22 games versus the Yankees. He went 2-0 with a 2.31 ERA in four starts against them last year - and also won a playoff series clincher at Yankee Stadium. ### Yankees: RHP Domingo GermÃ¡n (9-1, 3.43) leads the majors in wins. He won six straight starts before getting hammered for a career-high seven runs and nine hits, including four homers, over five innings Sunday in a no-decision at Kansas City.

9466,"Police had warrant to search journalist's phone before raid ### Raid may have violated shield law ### By Rick Hurd ### Posted: 9:16 AM, June 01, 2019 ### Updated: 9:16 AM, June 01, 2019 ### An image from surveillance footage at Bryan Carmody's home on Friday, May 10, 2019. ### SAN FRANCISCO - The San Francisco police department obtained a warrant to search the phone of the freelance journalist at the center of a controversy over a leaked report, and were authorized to conduct monitoring on the device months before a raid on his home and office, documents released Friday showed. ### In a statement emailed to this newspaper Friday, an attorney for the journalist, Bryan Carmody, accused police of obtaining the warrant illegally. Police raided Carmody's home earlier this month after unflattering reports about late San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi were leaked to Carmody, who in turn sold them to news stations. ### Related stories ### Reuters journalists jailed in Myanmar released ### Adachi died in February and was a staunch critic of police. ### ""Mr. Carmody received today a previously undisclosed search warrant obtained secretly and illegally by the San Francisco Police Department on March 1, 2019,"" Carmody's lawyer, Ben Berkowitz said in the statement. ""The SFPD appears to have used the illegal warrant to spy on Bryan's movements, phone calls and communications."" ### Late Friday afternoon, Police Chief Bill Scott announced that he has reached out to outside agencies to take over the investigation ""into the unauthorized release of the Jeff Adachi police report."" ### ""At the request of San Francisco Mayor London Breed, we are seeking an independent, impartial investigation by a separate investigatory body,"" Scott said. ### The case has generated controversy, because California has a shield law that protects journalists from being bullied by police into revealing confidential sources. ### ""This is an alarming and deeply disturbing attack on the free press in an attempt to unmask Mr. Carmody's confidential source,"" Berkowitz said. ""The warrant provided for ongoing surveillance of a journalist. The SFPD's actions are plainly illegal under the First Amendment and California's Shield Law. This is outrageous conduct by the SFPD. We are calling on city officials to hold the SFPD accountable."" ### Scott addressed the shield law in his statement. ### ""I am specifically concerned by a lack of due diligence by department investigators in seeking search warrants and appropriately addressing Mr. Carmody's status as a member of the news media,"" Scott said. ""This has raised important questions about our handling of the case, and whether the California shield law was violated."" ### Scott also said the department will continue its own investigation into the obtaining of the warrant. ### ""I am committed to leading a department that is transparent, accountable and reflects the values of [San Francisco]. The residents ... our mayor and city leaders, news media and the hardworking men and women of the police department deserve better. We understand that faith in the SFPD has been shaken, and we will work hard to restore it."" ### Scott last week apologized for the raid, calling it improper. Days earlier, he announced that Carmody was under criminal investigation for conspiring with a police department employee to steal a report about Adachi, saying Carmody ""crossed a line."" ### Scott made those comments hours after agreeing to return the equipment from Adachi that police seized in the raid. ### After Scott's reversal and apology, the San Francisco Police Officers Association called for his resignation. ### Staff writer Thomas Peele contributed to this report. ### The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

80066,"Read More By : Alexey Sukachev ### Eastern Europe Update: Vlasov, Khatchikian, Gurguliani Win ### By Alexey Sukachev ### In what has come a little bit under the radar, two Russian participants of the recent World Boxing Super Series in the cruiserweight division, got back to the winning columns a week ago in Krasnodar, Russia, against relatively soft opponents. The show took place at Cortesia Hall on May 19 under SJV Boxing Promotions. ### IBF #9 and WBC #13 ranked Ruslan Fayfer, who has lost to Andrew Tabiti, outboxed rugged Ukrainian Sergiy Radchenko (7-4, 2 KOs) over ten rounds with wide scores: 99-91, 98-92, and 97-94. ### Radchenko, putting his mediocre record aside, is best known for almost knocking out ex-WBO champion KrzysztofGlowacki in February 2018 and bringing another Pole Adam Balski (12-0 at the time) to the limit at the end of 2018. Fayfer is now 24-1, 16 KOs. ### WBO #8 Maxim Vlasov (43-3, 26 KOs) had even less trouble against hard-heating but raw Venezuelan Omar Garcia (14-2, 12 KOs). Garcia has upset previously undefeated Movsur Yusupov just a month ago but was hugely overmatched by one of the Russia’s finest. Vlasov scored a stoppage in the fourth, while decking Garcia once in the third. ### Timex Boxing Promotions, led by Marcel and Mariusz Grabowski staged a nice-packed local show with a single world title fight this past Saturday in Jelenia Gora, Poland. ### In the main event, local female star Ewa Brodnicka (17-0, 2 KOs) barely retained her WBO Super featherweight title and unblemished record with a hard-fought, close majority decision over former WBA/IBF bantamweight champion Janeth Perez of Mexico. Perez, 29, gave her all as she always does (she has never lost one-sidedly previously in her career), but lost just barely: 95-95, 94-96, and 93-97. Her record goes down to 24-5-2, 6 KOs, while Brodnicka, 34, retained her belt for the third time. ### Welterweight Michal “Pike” Lesniak (11-1-1, 3 KOs) was also seen in a close fight, digging deep to overcome always tough Russian import Maxim Churbanov (8-4-1). Scores were: 78-74, and 77-75 (twice) for the Pole. ### In an all-Polish encounter, junior welterweight Michal Chudecki continued his W-streak by getting the better of Kamil Mlodzinski (11-4-4, 6 KOs) on a close unanimous decision: 78-74, 78-75, and 77-75. ### Finally, speaking of fight of note, heavyweight Marcin Siwy (19-0, 8 KOs) accomplished a somewhat historical feat by putting Ukrainian veteran and former two-time (2000 and 2004) Olympian Alexey Mazikin below 0.500 with a stoppage win in round four. Siwy dropped Mazikin down with a left hook in the second and repeated this trick thrice more in the third, ending the fight at 1:18 of the round. Mazikin, who was once ranked in top-15, has scored just a single win (against 0-1 opponent) over the last ten years and has lost his ninth straight, going down to 14-15-2, 4 KOs. ### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ### On the same date in a much bigger Polish city of Poznan, albeit in at a far lesser event, another Ukrainian Olympian (class of 2008) Olexander Stretskiy, now 33, avenged the sole loss of his pro career, which he suffered in September 2017, by outpointing Bartolomiej Grafka (22-34-3, 10 KOs) with a single score by the referee: 77-75. Stretskiy is now 8-1-1, 3 KOs. ### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ### Netherlands-based Armenian middleweight Gevorg Khatchikian continued his winning road on Saturday night at de Bonte Wever in Assen, scoring a wide points victory over Ukrainian journeyman Ruslan Schelev (15-12-1, 8 KOs), who was dropped in the seventh round. The score was 100-89. Khatchikian, best known for his losses to James DeGale and Gilberto Ramirez, is now 29-2, 14 KOs. ### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ### It’s amazing how one’s career can change over a short period of time – both to the worse and to the better. Arif Magomedov, who debuted as a pro in 2013, was once one of Russia’s top prospects, with one-sided wins over 16-0 Alex Theran and Michael Zerafa and the first-round blowout of dangerous gatekeeper Darnell Boone. ### Magomedov was up in the stars before being mercilessly brought down – firstly by little-known Andre Hernandez (11-4 at the time), and then being stopped by Luis Arias.

Magomedov wasn’t his first victim, as he soundly outboxed 25-3 Nuhu Lawal just half a year before that. Then Gurguliani missed a year only to strike again.

But he said that would be possible only if the Census asked every household about its members' immigration status for the first time since 1950. ### The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on that question as early as next month. But Republicans who support adding the citizenship question have rarely acknowledged any partisan political motive. The emergence of the documents now could figure heavily in the case the court is considering. ### To civil liberties lawyers suing to block the question, it's now clear that partisan politics were at work all along. They assert in court filings that Hofeller not only laid out the political benefit for the GOP but also ghost-wrote a U.S. Department of Justice letter calling on the Census Bureau to add an immigration question to next year's survey. ### The Justice Department denied the allegations in a statement on Thursday, saying Hofeller's Texas analysis ""played no role in the Department's December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census."" In that 2017 letter, Justice said it needed citizenship information to protect the voting rights of minorities. ### The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the citizenship question in April and is expected to rule by July whether it will be allowed. ### ""What it would result in is outrageously overpopulated and underpopulated districts,"" said Matt Angle, a Democratic redistricting strategist, adding that the resulting maps would harm Texas' booming Hispanic population with the aim of benefiting Republicans. ### Many of the state's top Republicans, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , have publicly expressed support for a citizenship question on the Census. On Friday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's office did not respond to questions about whether he would endorse using citizenship data to draw new maps, although a spokeswoman said last year that the Census question would provide greater transparency and was dismissive of fears of under-reporting. ### Opponents contend that many noncitizens and their relatives will shy away from being counted, fearing that law enforcement will be told of individuals' citizenship status. That could cause undercounts in places with large Latino populations, including parts of Texas, California, Florida and Arizona, and could cost them seats in Congress as well as federal funding. ### But the political impact of the citizenship question could go beyond an undercount if states use citizenship information to draw the maps for state legislative districts. The concept was introduced in legislation over the last few years in Missouri and Nebraska, where the state constitution already calls for excluding ""aliens"" from its apportionment. And Alabama has sued the federal government saying it should supply citizenship information. ### In Texas, Hofeller calculated in his report that about a half-dozen Latino-dominated districts would disappear, including a portion of one in the Dallas area, up to two in Houston's Harris County and two or three in the border counties of South Texas. ""A switch to the use of citizen voting age population as the redistricting population base for redistricting would be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,"" he wrote. ### There's a question of whether the switch would be legal. ### The U.S. Constitution specifies that congressional districts should be based on how many people — not citizens — live there. But it's murkier for many state legislative districts. ### The case at the heart of Hofeller's 2015 report was brought by Texas voters who contended it was unfair that noncitizens and minors were counted in making legislative districts because it gave a bigger voice to a smaller number of eligible voters in places with a lot of noncitizens and children. In response, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that states could not be forced to use voting-age citizens as the basis for districting. ### Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with that decision but wrote a separate opinion that seems to invite states to do it on their own.

34301,"Trump's tariff plan shows the risks he's willing to take ###  ### Zeke Miller And Jill Colvin, The Associated Press ### Friday ### May 31, 2019 at 6:13 PM May 31, 2019 at 10:06 PM ### WASHINGTON (AP) "" Exasperated by reports of a flood of illegal border crossings, President Donald Trump summoned his top immigration advisers to demand action. Responding to his mounting concern, including his extreme threats to entirely close the U.S.-Mexico border, they prepared an alternative but still-inflammatory plan to levy escalating tariffs on all Mexican imports to the United States. ### Thursday night's surprise announcement of the plan by Trump, threatening to upend ratification chances for his own revised North American free trade pact, demonstrated the lengths to which the risk-taking president is willing to go to crack down on illegal immigration, even in the face of bipartisan criticism, legal challenges and polarized public feelings. ### He's setting the tricky politics of immigration and trade "" the two issues that defined his candidacy and bedevil his presidency "" on a collision course and injecting new tensions into his relations with political allies as he struggles to show results in his campaign for a second term. ### ""Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades,"" Trump declared anew in a tweet on Friday. That was the morning after he announced the 5% tariff would kick in on June 10 "" and increase monthly to 25% ""until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied."" ### ""Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!"" he said. ### Debate over solutions aside, indicators at the border have indeed been getting worse. For May, officials said Thursday, apprehensions are expected to hit their highest level in more than a dozen years and ""significantly surpass the record 109,000 in April,"" said acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan. ### On Wednesday, a group of 1,036 "" including families and unaccompanied children "" was appended after crossing from Juárez. That was the largest group ever apprehended at the border. ### Nonetheless, Trump's tariff prescription for the problem was instantly panned across the political spectrum . Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a usual Trump ally and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said it was a ""misuse of presidential tariff authority"" that would burden American consumers and ""seriously jeopardize passage"" of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada pact to modify the North American Free Trade Agreement. ### ""Imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico is exactly the wrong move,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the establishment lobbying giant that now is exploring legal action to block the tariffs. ### ""These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border,"" Bradley said, imploring Congress and the president to work together to address border problems. ### To both allies and critics, the tariff escalation marks the latest manifestation of Trump's increasing reliance on instinct and his aides' increasing unwillingness or inability to constrain an impulsive leader. Many of the people who had once talked Trump out of going through with his most radical ideas, such as completely shutting down the southern border or renewing the controversial immigrant child separation policy, have been pushed out of the administration, including former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. ### The tariff announcement was made with a striking amount of secrecy for the leak-prone Trump administration, with barely two dozen officials in the West Wing aware of what was to transpire. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer and other officials with trade portfolios were not included in the final discussions Thursday and privately expressed opposition to the move, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. ### Trump is mindful that many of his efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration have been stymied by courts or Congress, and that his promise to build a border wall will be far from fulfilled by the time voters decide his political fate next year. With his campaign depending on even more of his hard-core supporters turning out in 2020 than in 2016, Trump's team is worried that the spike in crossings could prove to be a political headache with his base. ### But in aiming for progress on that front, Trump is now throwing into the wager another campaign promise: approval of his renegotiated North American trade pact. ### Sandwiched between two presidential foreign trips, and with senior adviser and Mexico liaison Jared Kushner out of the country, the tariff announcement caught many in the White House and on Capitol Hill unawares. Press secretary Sarah Sanders insisted that the White House had briefed key lawmakers and allies on the plan before it was announced, though some complained they found out only at the last moment, with no time to provide feedback. ### While the announcement was a surprise, Trump's ire over a sharp increase in southern border crossings and his demand for increasingly drastic action were not. Trump attorneys, including White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, had been studying how to fulfill the president's wish for weeks and settled on the tariff plan as a more legally-sound move than Trump's push to close the border. ### White House officials assert that the tariff announcement was a negotiating tool, designed to get Mexico to act. And, perhaps seeking to calm anxious markets, they suggest the taxes might never take effect. ### ""We fully believe they have the ability to stop people coming in from their southern border and if they're able to do that, these tariffs will either not go into place or will be removed after they go into place,"" said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. ### Asked what Mexico can do to avoid the levies, press secretary Sanders said a good start would be for Mexico to send home Central American migrants crossing through their country to get into the United States. ### ""They can return them back home,"" she said. ""They can stop these massive caravans from coming through their country into ours. That would be a very big first step."" ### ___",060119,1,"On Wednesday, a group of 1,036 "" including families and unaccompanied children "" was appended after crossing from Juárez.

82369,"Worsfold, a war-time coach, faces a battle to hang on ### Very large text size ### Loading ### John Worsfold has been Essendon's version of a war-time prime minister, having led the Bombers through their darkest hour of 2016, when they might have been torn apart by the year-long suspensions to players and the financial, legal and moral morass that ensued. ### Worsfold was a calm and commanding presence, helping the club avert upheaval. Game plans and team selection were lesser priorities than rebuilding trust and providing composed leadership in what was an unprecedented set of circumstances. ### If he's hardly Winston Churchill with words, honest John Worsfold was still a coach for the tumult of the times. ### Essendon's chairman has more than once cited Nathan Buckley and Damien Hardwick when defending Worsfold. ### Credit:AAP ### But Essendon are in peacetime today and, as with post-war Britain, the masses want to see a new prosperity. They've had enough of the rations. ### Advertisement ### No longer in the midst of an existential struggle, the Dons are facing a mini-crisis and another kind of challenge – to win games and play a consistent brand of football. ### Loading ### So Worsfold's future is on the line in the coming weeks. He is neither ""gone'' nor safe (I had wrongly assumed the latter). That he has a contract for 2020 gives him only a measure of protection, because the Bombers can find a way to reach a settlement if they want a change. ### In peacetime, fiscal rectitude is less critical than football results, particularly at a club with Essendon's capacity to conjure dollars from their endless coteries and cashed-up fans. The soft cap on footy spending isn't necessarily a deterrent. ### Following the club's abysmal loss to Richmond, Worsfold pleaded for time, comparing his position to that of the formerly imperilled Nathan Buckley and Damien Hardwick and saying that last year was really his first season of clean air, post the drug scandal. ### Interestingly, Essendon chairman Lindsay Tanner also has more than once cited Buckley and Hardwick when defending Worsfold, suggesting that those calling for Worsfold's head were the same critics who'd demanded that Collingwood and Richmond guillotine their coaches. ### While Worsfold has had much less time than those coaches, it seems unlikely that Essendon will be as patient. The club has traded out first-round picks for 2017, 2018 and 2019, bringing in Devon Smith, Jake Stringer, Adam Saad and Dylan Shiel. Nothing than less finals is acceptable this year. ### Bomber Joe Daniher's 2019 was over before it had a chance to really get going. ### Credit:AAP ### Worsfold must earn the right to his 2020 contract. And he can only do this by demonstrating that, in the face of injuries to stars, the Dons have a method and mettle that does not waver, regardless of who's sitting in the stands with Joe Daniher. ### It's undeniable that Essendon and their coach have been shirtfronted by injury. The absence of Daniher and now Smith for the season, the frequent sidelining of Orazio Fantasia and Jake Stringer's hamstring have left them with a pop-gun attack, almost bereft of game-turners and goalkickers. ### The Essendon hierarchy must take this medical misfortune into account, although they also have to work out if the conditioning and treatment of sore stars - especially Daniher – has played any role in prolonging their time out. ### Worsfold's problem is that Richmond, Collingwood and West Coast have all coped with significant or worse injury tolls, yet have developed a system and culture that transcends personnel. Their method rarely wavers. ### Worsfold's problem is that Richmond, Collingwood and West Coast have all coped with significant or worse injury tolls, yet have developed a system and culture that transcends personnel. Their method rarely wavers. ### If, prior to the season, you'd known that the Tigers would be without Trent Cotchin, Jack Riewoldt, Alex Rance and Toby Nankervis for the Dreamtime game, you'd assume the Bombers – even without Daniher, Smith and Fantasia – would get up. They weren't close. ### In a competition as equalised as the AFL, teams have no choice but to develop systems and interchangeable parts (read: players) that can be plugged in and keep them competitive. Collingwood went to a grand final with a glued-together Tyson Goldsack at full-back and Jeremy Howe as the other key defender; the Eagles didn't have Nic Naitanui or Andrew Gaff. ### Essendon hired Ben Rutten from the Tigers to teach team defence. To date, progress has been sluggish. ### So, if it's clear what Worsfold must do to keep his job (but unclear how), the Essendon board, led by ex-Bomber and footy director Sean Wellman and chief executive Xavier Campbell, have three options for dealing with the coach and an underperforming team: ### 1. Steady as she goes ### This means comparatively little changes over the post-season; that the club believes they are on track and make only minor adjustments. This seems improbable, unless results come quickly – starting on Sunday against the Blues. ### 2. The coach-saving, Richmond/Collingwood review ### The coach is ultimately retained after a forensic, root-and-branch review of football operations. Assistant coaches – particularly those who have been there for a quite a while – are moved on and others brought in who help offset the coach's weaknesses. The game plan is (eventually) revamped, the coach redresses his own weaknesses after frank feedback. Essendon's head of football, Dan Richardson, was at Tigerland for the 2016 review, so he would be well-placed to follow the Tiger template. That said, every club is different and it might be that the Bombers decide their assistant coaches, support staff and organisational structure are fine, which leads to the third way ... ### 3. Worsfold goes ### Historically the simplest, easiest answer, the major query on sacking the coach will be his replacement. Essendon have the innate big club's bias towards the alpha coach - someone with a track record or brand name (or a favourite son), rather than an anonymous assistant. ### It's possible that Sunday's opponents Carlton will jump to jettison Brendon Bolton in order to get into the market first and secure their man, whether that's Brad Scott or another candidate. Will Essendon get twitchy too? Essendon's meeting with Carlton is freighted with greater consequences for the Dons coach than his Carlton counterpart, for whom a victory might only provide temporary relief, a Panadol in the context of his season. ### Worsfold has asked for time. Given the circumstances of Essendon – so different from the war time Woosha walked into in 2016 - he might only get a dozen weeks, at most, to prove he's a coach for all seasons.",060119,1,"3.

Liberty Hill (33-5-1) hadn’t lost since a 5-0 setback to Lorena on March 2. Despite this, the Bears were confident. ### “They pitched their best guy (Thursday), and we knew we could past get the next guy and once we got past him, we knew we were going to be able to go all-out today,” said Parrish, whose team lost to Oklahoma State signee Wyatt Cheney on Thursday. ### Clayton Chadwick and his La Vernia teammates hoist the Region IV trophy after the Bears swept Liberty Hill on Saturday at Dripping Springs High School to clinch the school’s first state tournament berth. ### Clayton Chadwick and his La Vernia teammates hoist the Region IV trophy after the Bears swept Liberty Hill on Saturday at Dripping Springs High School to clinch the school’s first state tournament berth. ### Photo: Photos By Tom Reel /Staff Photographer ### Photo: Photos By Tom Reel /Staff Photographer ### Image 1 of / 1 ### Close ### Image 1 of 1 ### Clayton Chadwick and his La Vernia teammates hoist the Region IV trophy after the Bears swept Liberty Hill on Saturday at Dripping Springs High School to clinch the school’s first state tournament berth. ### Clayton Chadwick and his La Vernia teammates hoist the Region IV trophy after the Bears swept Liberty Hill on Saturday at Dripping Springs High School to clinch the school’s first state tournament berth. ### Photo: Photos By Tom Reel /Staff Photographer ### La Vernia defeats Liberty Hill twice to advance to state ### 1  /  1 ### Back to Gallery ### The Bears will be joined by Argyle — the reigning state champions who are ranked No. 2 nationally by USA Today — Sweeny and Kilgore in the 4A tournament that begins Wednesday at UFCU Disch Falk Field in Austin. Pairings will be announced Sunday. ### La Vernia rode strong pitching performances by seniors Clayton Chadwick and Hunter Homeyer in both games. Parrish was a combined 5 for 7 on Saturday. ### Homeyer earned a save in the first game by striking out Kory Schmidt —the only batter he faced — to clinch the 5-2 victory. Chadwick, who didn’t allow a hit until the fifth inning, earned the win as he allowed five hits and struck out three. ### The Bears forced the third game by scoring three runs in the first three innings against the Panthers’ TCU-bound starter Kaden Dydalewicz. Homeyer scored two on a double in the first. The Bears made it 3-0 when Parrish doubled in Chadwick, who led off the third with a triple. ### “Momentum,” Homeyer said. “That’s what baseball is, and the team just backed me up after that. That’s all you could ask for … Jumping on (Dydalewicz) got in his head and got in his team’s heads, and that was the biggest deal right there.” ### The Panthers cut it to 3-1 in the bottom of the fifth when Ryan Leary drew a bases-loaded walk with no outs. La Vernia added two in the top of the seventh after Colton Swize scored on Koy Carpenter’s single. Parrish singled in John-Michael Kadrmas for the other run. ### Homeyer got the start in Saturday’s second game and was perfect through four innings as La Vernia led 5-0. ### The Bears scored four in the second on five hits. Homeyer singled in Parrish, who opened the inning with a triple. Homeyer scored on a grounder to the shortstop and Kadrmas had a two-run double. ### La Vernia added a run when Chadwick scored on Lance Kruse’s grounder to first. ### “It makes us feels comfortable and we can just sit back and do what we do,” Chadwick said of getting a big lead in Saturday’s second game. “Those five runs were important.” ### The Panthers cracked Homeyer in the sixth with four straight hits that led to four-run inning. Pudge Carlisle drew the Panthers to 5-4 with a two-run triple. ### Kruse pitched a perfect seventh in relief of Homeyer to earn the save. ### dhinojosa@express-news.net",060119,1,Back to Gallery###The Bears will be joined by Argyle — the reigning state champions who are ranked No. 2 nationally by USA Today — Sweeny and Kilgore in the 4A tournament that begins Wednesday at UFCU Disch Falk Field in Austin.

13417,"Delingpole: How President Trump Can Out-Green the Prince of Wales ### ATTILA KISBENEDEK/AFP/Getty ### 1 Jun 2019 ### Dear President Trump, ### We’re so looking forward to your state visit to the UK next week: it will annoy all the right people and delight all the right people — a win/win, and I know you like winning. ### Before you arrive, I’d like to give you some friendly advice on how to win some more. It pertains to what could be a very sticky meeting you’re going to have on Monday with our future king, the Prince of Wales. ### Prince Charles will no doubt insist on lecturing you about climate change and your supposed failure to take it seriously. ### Your inclination may be to ignore him because though you’re no scientist — nor by the way is he — your perfectly-formed bullshit antennae enabled you to see the truth of the matter long ago: “climate change” is a scam being pushed by the radical left to make their mission to destroy Western industrial civilisation look like it’s caring and scientifically justified and inevitable. ### But wait a second. You can do better than make this meeting an uneasy draw between two implacable opponents. Play this one right and you can come away with another victory. ### There’s nothing eco-loons like Prince Charles love more than taking the moral high ground. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to demonstrate convincingly that in fact you are the one with rightness, truth and justice on his side. ### Here is how: ### You’re Rescuing the World from the Biggest Bill in History ### More than $1.5 trillion every year is currently being spent on the global warming industry. Not a cent of this expenditure will be necessary if you can prove that the man-made climate change scare is #fakenews. And that’s just what you’re doing step by step : withdrawing from the UN Paris climate accord; restoring rigour to the science at the U.S. Geographical Survey and the National Climate Assessment; appointing world-class physicist William Happer to head a new Climate Review Panel. ### Imagine if, instead of lining the pockets of junk scientists and crony capitalists, those trillions could be spent on problems that really exist: eradicating disease and malnutrition; enacting Bjorn Lomborg’s scheme to ensure that everyone in the world has access to clean drinking water. ### Saving the Children ### As a victim of the world’s second-biggest #fakenews story — Russiagate — you’re just the man to tackle the world’s biggest #fakenews story: environmental catastrophism. Unlike the lying, legacy media, you’re not afraid to take on the real bad guys and call them out for the dangerous charlatans they are. Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old autistic kid (and tool of green lobbyists ) who can literally see ‘carbon’ — or so she claims — and who has bewitched politicians and influencers across the world into imagining that yet more taxpayers’ money should be chucked at a non-existent problem. Sir David Attenborough, whispery-voiced gorilla-hugging Malthusian, slayer of walruses . The fact that they come across well on telly and appeal straight to people’s emotions is what makes them so dangerous. Global policy should not be based on muh feelings. Still less should it be based on “facts” which, on closer examination, turn out to be derived not from evidence or data but Ice Age 2. We owe it to the world’s children to tell them the truth about global warming — and related #fakenews scares like ‘ocean acidification’ and mass species extinction. Too many of them have been brainwashed into thinking they have no future; they are resentful and pessimistic where they should be positive and informed. ### Conservatives Don’t Kill the Planet — Environmentalists Do ### Yes, there have been terrible man-made environmental disasters but most of them happened either in developing nations — Bhopal etc — or behind the Iron Curtain — Chernobyl, the Aral Sea, etc. In the West, much of the damage to the planet is being done by environmentalists trying to save it: wind turbines slicing and dicing birds and bats; rainforests being chopped down to grow palm oil; American hardwood forests being chopped to make wood chips to fuel Britain’s Drax power station. The problem with so much environmental legislation is that it’s designed by green ideologues who are more interested in wrecking Western industrial civilisation than they are in saving the planet. The more quickly you roll back this counterproductive legislation — together with the subsidies paid to the destructive, inefficient renewables industry — the more prosperous the world will become; and consequently, the more money the world’s poorer nations will have available to live — as the cant green term has it — ‘sustainably.’ ### Trees ### This is your jujitsu moment: where you unbalance your opponent by using his own apparent strength against him. Does Prince Charles care about the trees? Of course he does. He probably talks to them and hugs them every day before breakfast. But what you can show is that you care more — and that you are taking more practical steps to care for them. ### I asked Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace about this: what causes can we true conservationists support to do our bit for the planet. He says that better tree management — silviculture — would be maybe the most important step. Trees and forests comprise over 90 per cent of the world’s biomass. Before we start lecturing countries like Brazil on how to use their natural resources sustainably, we first need to take care of the problems on our own doorstep. In the U.S., for example, forests on federal land have been badly mismanaged as a result of wrongheaded green policies. This needs to change: forests need to be managed, not preserved in aspic. They need to be thinned and occasionally they need controlled burning. Only this way will we have healthy trees and avoid the fires like the ones which devastated parts of California last year. ### Among the practical measures that could be taken, making you, Mr President, the greenest since Teddy Roosevelt: ### An aggressive programme of fighting tree diseases and insect pests to stem the onslaught of deciduous tree deaths. ### Major research funding to find new environmentally friendly fungicide, biocides, and insecticides that won’t harm pollinating insects. I know a guy working on this: can put you in touch. ### Additional support of colleges focused on forest management, forest ecology, plant pathology, scholarships — all designed to circumvent the pernicious influence of ideology-driven environmental degree courses and turn out practically-minded conservationists who actually know useful stuff. ### Triple federal support for preventing and controlling wildfires and forest fires with more staff, equipment, customised fire fighting planes, and helicopters. ### Greenies love to portray themselves as the only people who care about the environment, those Truffula trees. Don’t concede them territory they don’t deserve. ### Plastics in the oceans ### Sure you care about plastic pollution. Doesn’t everyone? The difference is that you understand that the latest moral panic about plastics — with cynical or naive politicians flailing around to see who can ban them most quickly — is just a proxy for the green movement’s war on fossil fuels. Plastic is actually extremely versatile, useful, and a boon to mankind. The vast majority of plastic pollution comes from the third world and the developing world — mainly Africa and especially Asia. If you want to stop plastic waste, put a price on it. Help incentivise polluting countries to dispose of their waste effectively and profitably. According to Patrick Moore — who really knows his stuff: you should meet up — by far the best way to do this is waste-to-energy. The U.S. can provide the technological advice and the loans or funding. Job done; whales and turtles saved. ### I hope these tips prove useful, Mr President, not just for your meeting with the Prince of Wales but for your conflicts with those Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who are determinedly trying to reposition green issues as the key ideological battleground of our age. We cannot allow them to take the moral high ground. These people are anti-science, anti-human, anti-prosperity, anti-freedom, and — ironically — anti-environment. If they win the planet loses. So let us never let them get away with it. ###  ###  ### James Delingpole",060119,1,"As a victim of the world’s second-biggest #fakenews story — Russiagate — you’re just the man to tackle the world’s biggest #fakenews story: environmental catastrophism.

27014,"Israel Preparing For Large-Scale Offensive in Gaza – Reports ### 11 months ago ### The state of Israel has given Hamas until Friday to stop its flaming kite attacks on Israeli territory. The report comes as Israel’s Parliament has stripped the prime minister of the right to declare war. ### By Sputnik International ### Israeli leadership has reportedly instructed the country’s military forces to prepare to invade the Gaza Strip if the flaming kite attacks don’t cease by this week, according to a Channel 10 news report cited by The Times of Israel. ### According to the report, Israel has given Hamas until Friday to stop its flaming kite and balloon attacks; if Hamas fails to comply with the demand, Israel might decide it has no choice but to start a large-scale military operation. ### Israel sent the message directly to Hamas via Egyptian intelligence services, Channel 10 reported. The report also says Hamas responded by saying its forces will work to stop the rogue attacks by Friday. ### On Sunday, the Israeli 162nd Armored Division launched a military exercise simulating an attack on the Gaza Strip and a capture of Gaza City. While the Israeli military claims the exercise had been planned in advance and was not related to current events, some saw it as an indirect threat to Hamas. ### On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the IDF’s Gaza Division. During the visit, he said that the country is already in the midst of a “military campaign.” ### “We are in a military campaign in which there have been exchanges of blows. I am prepared to say that the Israel Defense Forces is prepared for any scenario,” Netanyahu said. ### The report comes right as the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, has stripped the country’s prime minister and defense minister of the ability to declare war. The new legislation adopted Tuesday delegates this power to the Security Cabinet — a body of several officials, including the ministers of foreign relations and finance. ### During the last few months, Israel has suffered numerous attacks by kites, balloons and other objects that act as flying incendiary bombs. Thousands of acres of land are reported to have been burned by these attacks. In addition, Israel reports numerous sporadic clashes with Palestinians and mortar and rocket fire at Israeli territory. The Times of Israel has noted that the level of tension between Israel and the Gaza Strip has reached an apex not seen since the 2014 Gaza war. ### This article ( Israel Preparing For Large-Scale Offensive in Gaza – Reports ) was originally published on Sputnik International and syndicated by The Event Chronicle . ### You may also like",060119,1,"On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the IDF’s Gaza Division.

The interbank market was closed on Saturday, but in the open market where retail clients buy and sell foreign exchange, the US currency lost another Re1 and was traded at Rs149. ### “The depreciation of the dollar has many reasons but the main reason was the price decline in the interbank which halted the rapid increase in the open market,” said Zafar Paracha, Secretary General Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan. ### He said increased supply of dollars created ample availability in the open market helping the local currency to recoup some of the earlier losses. ### Open market sees Re1 fall in greenback price amid improved availability ### “The exporters who were anticipating further increase in dollar price also returned to the interbank after falling trend in exchange rate,” he said, adding that demand also dropped. ### He said those who invested in dollars have started selling their holdings as the price started falling. ### Currency experts said another reason for declining demand for dollars was the recent interest rate hike. “Investing in banking products is much more attractive than in dollars,” he remarked. ### The current policy rate is 12.25pc and the government offers more than this rate through Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) and Savings Certificates. ### Sources in financial sector said the big banks are still offering less than 10pc on deposits, but small banks are offering up to 14-15pc return per annum on deposits as they depend largely on deposits. ### “If the government sells PIBs through stock market and lets other outlets like exchange companies, it will make it easier for general public to invest in these bonds, pressure on the dollar would vanish. Also, the government will directly raise liquidity from the public,” said Paracha. ### At present, usually big banks invest in government securities including PIBs.

90967,"Waived by Portland, Mallory Weber finding a home with Utah Royals FC ### email ### (Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Portland Thorns FC forward Mallory Weber (26) and Utah Royals FC defender Becky Sauerbrunn (4) go for the ball, in soccer action between Utah Royals FC and Portland Thorns FC, at Rio Tinto Stadium, Saturday, April 28, 2018. ### ·  Published: 1 day ago ### Updated: 21 hours ago ### Sandy • At the beginning of the month, Mallory Weber lived in Portland. She had built a life and a home there with her dog, Meeko, and played for the Thorns for the past three years — the entirety of her National Women’s Soccer League career. ### Then in one moment, her life changed in an instant. The Thorns waived Weber and it would be an excruciating 48 hours until she knew where her career would take her next, if anywhere at all. ### “It’s just something that comes out of nowhere without much explanation,” Weber recently told The Salt Lake Tribune. ### But Laura Harvey and the Utah Royals FC were waiting in the wings to pick up the Novi, Mich., native. The Royals signed Weber about two weeks ago to replace Taylor Lytle and Brittany Ratcliffe , both of whom suffered season-ending injuries. ### Weber made her season debut on the road in the late stages of the tie with North Carolina and also played 23 minutes in the win over the Orlando Pride . It’s only been two games, but so far, so good. ### “I think that for Mal, she’s fitted in seamlessly, honestly, and works hard every day in training,” Harvey said of Weber. “She’s a fantastic teammate and a really easy person to coach, honestly. It’s been a seamless transition to bring her into this group.” ### Weber started 21 of 45 games for Portland and scored one goal in her three-plus seasons there. She even won an NWSL title there in 2017. But her departure left a bitter taste in her mouth. By the end of her tenure, she had lost confidence in herself as a player, she said. ### But since arriving in Salt Lake City — she drove herself and Meeko from Portland — and joining the Royals, her spirits have risen. She’s been impressed by the twice-daily meals provided to the players, the furnished apartments, the team vehicles and the setup in the team locker room. In Portland, she thought the Thorns set the standard for how an organization treats its professional women’s soccer players. Her opinion has since changed. ### “This is above and beyond that,” Weber said of URFC’s amenities. ### Weber said the most difficult aspect of being waived by Portland was having to leave her teammates, who had become close friends during the time she spent with the Thorns. So far in Salt Lake, it appears she is on the path to making new friends with those on the Royals roster. ### Article continues below ### Related Articles ### Utah Royals FC defender Rachel Corsie makes Women’s World Cup roster for Scotland ### “The team has been really welcoming and supportive and I’m actually very happy that Utah picked me up and that I’m here,” Weber said. ### With six Royals players on international duty for the upcoming Women’s World Cup, Weber has a good opportunity to not only break the rotation, but perhaps earn starts as well. And while just a few weeks ago she didn’t know whether or not she would be out of the league, she is relishing the opportunity to make URFC her new home. ### “To wait those 48 hours to see what was going to happen was probably the most stressful thing I’ve been through in my career so far,” Weber said. “But totally worth the wait and I think this is a better place for me to be to push my career soccer-wise, for sure.” ### UTAH ROYALS FC AT WASHINGTON SPIRIT ### At Maryland SoccerPlex in Germantown, Md. ### Kickoff » Saturday, 5 p.m. MDT ### TV » KMYU",060119,1,"(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Portland Thorns FC forward Mallory Weber (26) and Utah Royals FC defender Becky Sauerbrunn (4) go for the ball, in soccer action between Utah Royals FC and Portland Thorns FC, at Rio Tinto Stadium, Saturday, April 28, 2018.###·  Published: 1 day ago","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]","<p>(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Portland Thorns FC forward Mallory Weber (26) and Utah Royals FC defender Becky Sauerbrunn (4) go for the ball, in soccer action between Utah Royals FC and Portland Thorns FC, at Rio Tinto Stadium, Saturday, April 28, 2018.</p><p>·  Published: 1 day ago</p>"

(AP) — Wisconsin is lagging behind most of its Midwest neighbors in attracting highly educated workers, according to a new study. ### The Wisconsin Policy Forum's analysis of federal data from 2017 found that 20% of Wisconsin natives ages 31 to 40 who had moved away from the state were highly educated. The nonpartisan research group defined ""highly educated"" as those who have earned a bachelor's degree or higher. ### In comparison, less than 10% of people in that age group who were born elsewhere and moved to the Badger State were considered highly educated, Wisconsin Public Radio reported. ### The findings show Wisconsin's skilled worker gap is the eighth highest in the country, only behind Iowa in the Midwest. Neighboring Illinois and Minnesota saw net gains in highly educated workers in the same age group. ### ""Relative to other states, Wisconsin's pretty strong at retaining people, but doesn't attract people into the state that have college degrees, for example,"" said Joe Peterangelo, the organization's senior researcher. ### ×",060119,1,"Updated: June 1, 2019 @ 5:17 pm###Study: Wisconsin will need to attract more educated workers###May 31, 2019","[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]","<p>Updated: June 1, 2019 @ 5:17 pm</p><p>Study: Wisconsin will need to attract more educated workers</p><p>May 31, 2019</p>"

Houston St. holds furnishings and items dating back to the early 1800s that belonged to the influential and politically active family who lived there. ### Sarah McClendon (1910-2003), one of the first female news reporters to cover the White House, was raised there. McClendon’s career in Washington spanned from presidents Roosevelt to Clinton. ### The McClendon House is located on land owned by Judge M.H. Bonner, a Texas State Supreme Court associate justice from 1878 to 1882. Bonner’s son-in-law and daughter, Harrison and Mattie Whitaker, built the house known for its fine furnishings and as the site of social gatherings. ### The Whitakers sold the house to Mattie’s sister, Annie, and her husband, Sydney McClendon, who raised nine children there. Their youngest child was Sarah McClendon. ### In 1981, two elderly family members donated the house to the Society for the Restoration and Historic Preservation of the Bonner-Whitaker-McClendon House, a nonprofit organization. ### The house, a well-preserved example of Victorian-inspired architecture, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ### McClendon House Society members later learned some of the family’s personal belongings were stored in several large boxes off-site, Daye Collins, a longtime board member, said. ### Some of the items that had been stored are now on display in a new exhibit in the Archives Room on the second floor. ### “These items have never been seen (by the public) before,” Collins said. ### The exhibit covers the period after World War I, when Sydney and Annie McClendon lived in the house, and includes clothing worn by the women and cases filled with photographs, letters and documents. ### It is a follow-up to a previous exhibit on the family during the war. ### “This picks the story up where the other one left off,” Collins said. “It was a changing world.” ### The exhibit draws attention to the work of Sydney as Democratic Party chairman in Smith County and Annie as an enthusiastic suffragette who took part in “Votes for Women” rallies, Collins said. ### Photos show some of the McClendon daughters wearing the more revealing flapper-style dressers. Letters and papers chronicle the sons advancing post-war professional interests. ### “This was what was going all over the United States,” Collins said. ### Collins said items recovered from storage shed new light on experiences of the family and their contributions to society. ### “We are still uncovering things (from the boxes),” Collins said. ### There is enough new material to keep putting together exhibits chronicling the family’s lives through future decades, she said. ### The McClendon House is open for tours from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. each Friday and Saturday.

46594,"Associated Press ### CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The attacker who killed two students and wounded four others in a  North Carolina university classroom  may have recorded video of the classroom carnage on his cellphone, a Charlotte television station reported Saturday. ### A new arrest warrant described former student Trystan Andrew Terrell telling police he recorded video at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte on April 30, WSOC  reported  . Two students were killed and four were wounded. ### A police spokeswoman said Saturday she would not provide The Associated Press with a copy of the warrant filed in court, citing the ongoing investigation. ### The arrest warrant indicates that the first officer on scene thought the accused shooter may be one of the victims and asked Terrell, 22, if he had been shot. He told the officer he was lying on the ground because he had been tackled, the warrant said. A gun was found nearby, WSOC reported. ### Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said last month that 21-year-old  Riley Howell  , who was killed, saved a number of lives by charging and tackling the gunman when he opened fire in a classroom in the school’s Kennedy Building. Ellis Parlier, 19, was also killed inside his anthropology lecture hall. ### Survivor Drew Pescaro, 19, said he was shot in the back near his spine almost as soon as the gunman entered the classroom and started firing. ### “I was on the ground. The other two kids that were shot and didn’t make it was on the ground, and the shooter himself was on the ground as well,” Pescaro  told  WNCN. ### “I just remember I heard the first shot and then pretty much everything went deaf after that,” he  told  WTVD. ### Pescaro was home this week in the Raleigh suburb of Apex after the latest of several returns to the hospital. UNCC chancellor Philip DuBois said on Twitter on Monday Pescaro had most recently suffered an infection and spent several days at Duke University’s hospital near his home. Pescaro said he expects another hospital visit next week to have stitches removed, but he’s thankful to be alive. ### Survivor Rami Alramadhan , 20, of Saihat, Saudi Arabia, recently had a bullet removed from his abdomen but is improving, the university said on Twitter last week. ### (Copyright (c) 2019 The Associated Press.

47416,"When They See Us True Story: Accuracy, Photos, & More ### Updated ### Jun 1, 2019 at 7:59pm ### The new Netflix show When They See Us has been released to critical success . But how accurate is the show on the story it’s rendering? According to Ava DuVernay, who created the four-part series, the story is “100% real.” ### In a tweet to a fan asking if the show was drama or based on true events, DuVernay tweeted back , “Not drama. 100% real. The real rapist is Matias Reyes. I shot the prison yard scene just as Korey told it to me. And the words Matias says to Nancy Ryan are almost word for word from his real confession. Wild, I know.” ### DuVernay tweeted to someone else, ### You witness no more than 10 minutes of who the boys were before they’re ripped out of their youth. Then you’re plunged into their nightmare. The voices you hear as they are being chased by police in the park are the actual 911 tapes from April 19, 1989. ### Here’s a brief summary of the Central Park Five story: ### In 1989, a woman running through Central Park was attacked, raped, and brutalized within an inch of her life. The Central Park Jogger was a woman named Trisha Meili . Her attack led to the wrongful conviction of the Central Park Five. ### The Central Park Five are four black men and one Hispanic man who were arrested and wrongfully committed for the rape of a white woman named Trisha Meili in 1989. They were eventually exonerated after one of the five, Korey Wise, met serial rapist Matias Reyes during his time in prison. Reyes would go on to admit that he committed the crime, and a subsequent DNA test would prove he was at the scene of the crime. ### Following the exoneration of the five men, the City of New York agreed to pay them a settlement of $41 million, which was approximately one million for each of their years spent in prison. When They See Us, a four-part series on Netflix directed by Ava DuVernay, explores the experience of these five men: Korey Wise, Raymond Santana, Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, and Kevin Richardson. ### Here’s what you need to know about how accurate the show’s rendering of the Central Park Jogger case was, what the original Central Park Five think, what the crime scene photos look like, and more: ### What Do The Central Park Five Think of When They See Us? ### Antron McCray, 1989 / New York City Law Department ### The members of the Central Park Five are Korey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Antron McCray. The men, now well into their 40s, have sat down with a number of publications leading up to the release of the show. ### They’ve confirmed, in a number of ways, how accurate the show is to their story, and how involved they were in the creation with it. ### Kevin Richardson, 1989 / New York City Law Department ### Santana was actually the one who first reached out to DuVernay with the idea of covering the famous case. On April 21, 2015, Santana tweeted to DuVernay , “What’s your next film gonna be on?? #thecentralparkfive #CP5 #centralpark5 maybe???? #wishfulthinking #fingerscrossed” ### To  The New York Times , Santana said, ### [Reliving these events] brings back the pain; it brings back the memories. But it’s necessary. I was ready and I was willing to relive, to go through that pain again, to cry — because it’s necessary. It’s a sacrifice. You want to change the culture, you’ve got to be engaged. This is how we got engaged. ### Korey Wise 1989 / New York City Law Department ### Salaam also spoke with the publication about his experience watching the show, and his reckoning, in particular, with Wise’s experience. Wise was the only one of the five to be tried and sentenced as an adult; as a result, he spent over a decade in prison. ### Salaam also talked to the publication about the guilt he felt for being the reason Wise was implicated in the crime to begin with. ### Raymond Santana 1989 / New York City Law Department ### He said: ### When I saw this series, I immediately realized that we were in paradise compared to the hell that Korey was in. His was unrelenting. I went to jail and I was able to get a college degree. He never got an opportunity to breathe, to meditate, to just say, ‘Phew, man, that was really crazy today. Let me kick my feet up a little bit and read this magazine.’ That reality — pain, I think, is a better word — is knowing that he came because of me. Offering an “I’m sorry” doesn’t seem adequate. And I’ve been able to say that to him, but I also realized that that’s not adequate enough to know what he went through, or that he could have been killed in prison. He almost was. It’s not enough. And I have a direct role to play in that. ### Crime Scene Photos & the Matias Reyes Confession in Real Life [Warning: GRAPHIC] ### Matias Reyes / New York City Law Department ### The Central Park Five were eventually exonerated after one of the five, Korey Wise, met serial rapist Matias Reyes during his time in prison. Reyes would go on to admit that he committed the crime, and a subsequent DNA test would prove he was at the scene of the crime. ### Meili’s identity remained anonymous for 14 years; during those 14 years, the Central Park Five were arrested and wrongfully convicted for her assault and rape. In 2002, a year before Meili spoke out publicly to confirm her identity, Matias Reyes (a serial rapist) admitted to the crime. ### Here are the crime scene photos from the attack of the Central Park Jogger, as released by the New York City Law Department: ### ‌New York City Law Department ### The photo above shows a totally bloodied jacket. Meili lost 75 percent of her body’s blood during the attack. Her recovery was considered a miracle. ### ‌‌New York City Law Department ### Reyes decided to come forward after he met Korey Wise in prison. Wise was one of the Central Park Five, and the only one of the group who was tried and convicted as an adult for the crime. ### In 2002, Reyes, then 30, said at the time per The New York Daily News , “I know it’s hard for people to understand, after 12 years why a person would actually come forward to take responsibility for a crime. I’ve asked myself that question. At first, I was afraid, but at the end of the day I felt it was definitely the right thing to do.” ### ‌‌New York City Law Department ### According to  The New York Times in 2002, Reyes had a troubling childhood history, he claimed, where his mother sold him to his father for $400 and he was sexually assaulted when he was seven years old. Reyes’ criminal history leading up to his conviction in the Central Park jogger case was incredibly graphic: he raped and stabbed 24-year-old Lourdes Gonzalez in 1989 (the same year Meili was raped), while her three children were listening in the other room. ### ‌‌New York City Law Department ### During his confession in 2002 (which you can listen to in full here ), Reyes said that he “wanted so bad to approach” Wise while they were in jail together, “and to speak to him and to tell him that it was me that did the crime he’s in jail for, that if he could forgive me.” He added, “But there was a thing in the back of my head that was saying, ‘You don’t know what this kid has gone through in 12 years of his life.” ### He said in his confession, ### “I struck her from behind, back of the head. She fell down. After she fell down, I dragged her to the bushes. I violated her – raped her. And after I’m finished she’s struggling. I beat her with a rock…I went off. I hit her a lot of times. I heard bones crushing.” ### New York City Law Department ### After hearing news of the exoneration of the Central Park Five and the conviction of Reyes, Meili spoke out, maintaining she remembered nothing of the evening but that she was surprised that only one man would have been involved. She said to 20/20 , “When [Reyes] said that he and he alone had done it, that’s when some of the turmoil started, and [me] wondering, ‘Well, how can that be?'”",060119,1,"The members of the Central Park Five are Korey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Antron McCray.

Yes, all of the world, and definitely all of the Tri-State too. ### Summer theater season has descended upon us and the hills will be alive with the sound of music and iambic pentameter. ### Here's just a few of the shows this weekend and those being worked up just over the horizon. ### Park it for a Shakespeare beach party ### A few years back when Mike Murdock was at ARTS they had a great run of Murdock and that fine (now defunct) company of actors putting modern twists on a string of Shakespeare shows including ""Macbeth,"" ""Julius Caesar,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing"" as well as a straight-up version of ""As You Like It."" ### Murdock, back from a two-year stint with Greenbrier Valley Theater in Lewisburg, has rallied the Alchemy Theatre Troupe to present a two-weekend run of William Shakespeare's romantic comedy ""Twelfth Night (or What You Will)"" at 8 p.m. Saturday, June 1, and 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, June 7-8, at Barboursville Park Amphitheater. ### The show is being presented as part of the second annual WV Shakes Fest. ### All tickets are general admission and are $20 to see the play which is about two hours with a short intermission. ### On Saturday, June 8, an extra $5 pays for your ticket to the WV Shakespeare Festival in the same location. ### Since the 1602 written romantic comedy takes place on an island, Murdock, who is directing the play, has re-imagined its as an 70s/80s beach resort vibe. ### ""Because we were outdoors and because this is set on an island we wanted to go with a beach resort vibe with a very late 1970s, early to mid 1980s resort style,"" Murdock said. ""There's going to be a lot of Hawaiian shirts and an Magnum PI, a very Jimmy Buffett like vibe."" ### Murdock said for all shows they are encouraging folks to bring their own chairs or blankets to sit on and also to feel free to bring their own picnics and drinks to make a party of it. ### The two-weekend run will crescendo on Saturday, June 8, with a full-blown WV Shakes Fest that will start at 1 p.m. and feature a full days worth of fun including arts and crafts vendors, food vendors and entertainment throughout the day including some Shakespeare and some not Shakes related activities including bands, dance by Fourth Avenue Arts, some snippets from The Rusty Mechanicals (a touring Shakespeare Company out of Clarksburg) and something from the Albans Art Center as well. ### Murdock said he hopes folks will come out and embrace WV Shakes, a fest he hopes to grow as the state's only Shakespeare Fest. ### ""We want to make it bigger every year,"" Murdock said. ""A lot of my acting training is classical with Shakespeare and so I am ways drawn to it and have directed quite a bit of it in town and at Marshall and it is sort of in my wheelhouse. I like spreading The Bard's word."" ### Jeslyn Brings Magical Russian Folk Tale to Life ### At 6:30 p.m. Saturday, June 1, and at 3:30 p.m. Sunday, June 2, enjoy a one-night only performance by Jeslyn Dance Company at Fourth Avenue Arts (the old Camelot Theater). ### Jeslyn will weave their version of this tale inspired by Russian folklore as well as the author, Patricia Polacco and her children's book, 'Babushka Baba Yaga'. ### Performers include 4th Avenue Arts students, Jeslyn Dance Gallery Youth Ballet Company, local professional dancers of JDG: The Migration Project and a very special guest artist, Carli Mareneck, from Lewisburg, who will portray Baba Yaga herself. ### There will be something for everyone...Dancing, storytelling, fairies, wolves, babushkas (grandmothers) and fun. There will also be a Babushka Bake sale during the show, magical treasures for sale in the shoppe handcrafted by local artisans, and ""Baba Bouquets"" (homemade flowers) for purchase as a memento. ### Get tickets at https://squareup.com/store/4th-avenue-arts and go online at https://www.facebook.com/4thAvenueArts/ for more information. ### ""Mamma Mia!"" Outdoor Drama at Chief Logan ### Get whisked away to the Greek isles at the beautiful Liz Spurlock Amphitheater in Chief Logan State Park as The Aracoma Story, Inc., dials up the disco-fueled romantic comedy, ""Mamma Mia!"" ### Based on the hit, sing-a-long songs of the pop group ABBA, ""Mamma Mia"" tells the story about a mother, her daughter who is getting married, three possible fathers and a trip down the aisle with such tunes as ""Dancing Queen,"" ""Take a Chance on Me,"" ""The Winner Takes it All,"" ""SOS"" and many others. ### The show opened Thursday. It runs 8:30 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays through June 16. ### Advance tickets can be purchased from Gatti's at the Fountain Place Mall or online at www.brownpapertickets.com . ### Tickets are $15 and will be available at the gate, starting at 7:30 p.m. the evening of each show.

""And because music was so much a part of his life, he felt the need to contribute somehow."" ### Before his death in March at age 77, Joel became the impetus behind the Northeast Iowa School of Music's Healing Harmonies Chorus, an ensemble with an eye toward providing an outlet for non-care-center Alzheimer's disease patients in the tri-states, along with their caregivers. ### Thanks to Tracey Rush, Northeast Iowa School of Music founder, a part of Joel remains with the ensemble, which recently began its weekly rehearsals. ### In 2018, after Gorun had approached Rush with the idea for the group, Rush had been selected in a competitive process to participate in the National Guild's Catalyzing Creative Aging program, an initiative designed to support new creative aging programs at nonprofit arts education organizations nationwide. ### Through that support, Rush was able to help see Joel's dream through. ### ""Joel loved to sing, and he wanted to keep singing,"" Rush said. ""Something like this was just on his heart. And there can be limited creative outlets for people going through dementia and even for people in that 65 and older group."" ### The Healing Harmonies Chorus is a fitting ensemble for the Northeast Iowa School of Music, joining the roster alongside the New Horizons Band for those 50 and older. Rounding that out are music groups dedicated to youth, as well as the women's ensemble Sweet Adelines International and the Dubuque Community String Orchestra. ### ""When I started the school 18 years ago, I did it with the idea of music for all,"" Rush said. ""It's not just for kids. It's not just for adults. It's also for people with needs. It might not be therapy, but it can be therapeutic."" ### Healing Harmonies is led by Callie Mescher, a certified neurologic music therapist and piano and voice teacher in the Dubuque area. She specializes in working with those with disabilities, as well as those dealing with memory loss. ### ""This group isn't just about singing but about building relationships,"" said Mescher, who slowly warms the group up before working with them on good breath support, loosening their jaws, counting out rhythms and making music out of the small dots sitting upon staves on the page. ""And that's really what music is about as well."" ### The group sings memory-infused melodies such as ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" as well as patriotic tunes in preparation for an upcoming Fourth of July concert. ### ""Memory loss is a scary thing,"" Mescher said. ""There is no predicting it. So to see people picking up old melodies they knew and having an exposure to something creative, it just shows how powerful the mind and music are. A outlet like this is very exciting for our community."" ### The group currently fluctuates between six and nine people. Among them are former music teachers, as well as those who have never sung or played an instrument. ### Front and center is Marilyn, who admitted that it's difficult to be there without Joel singing alongside her. Yet, she's comforted in experiencing how his dream is benefiting others. ### ""My voice isn't anywhere near what Joel's was, but I'm enjoying getting back into singing,"" she said. ""And it's a way for me to keep connected to Joel."" ### Marilyn also is eager to see the group continue to grow as more people become familiar with it as a community offering. Those interested are encouraged to sign up, with a caregiver. ### ""There is one gentleman who has been in music for a long time, so it's rewarding to see that at this stage of his life, it's still something that he can enjoy,"" she said. ""Joel would have loved to have sung with this group. We owe a lot to Tracey and the Northeast Iowa School of Music. Without them, this might have died with Joel."" ### ___ ### Information from: Telegraph Herald, http://www.thonline.com ### An AP Member Exchange shared by the Telegraph Herald.",060119,1,""" Joel loved to sing, and he wanted to keep singing,"" Rush said.

62644,"New Canaan police hand out flyers for missing mom; state police expand search ### Posted: ### Updated: ### NEW CAANAN - ### New Canaan police handed out flyers Friday near Waveny Park in an effort to locate Jennifer Dulos, and in a major development state police say they are currently searching areas in Hartford in connection to the case. ### Officers were stopping drivers and handing out flyers on Lapham Road behind Waveny Park, where her car was found abandoned last Friday. Police were questioning drivers if they saw anything suspicious in the area a week ago. The checkpoint was done in the same three-hour window as when authorities believe her car was brought to the spot. ### Divers also searched a small pond in the park this morning. It was the third day crews covered some portion of Waveny. ### Dulos was last seen dropping her kids off at school on Friday. Friends reported her missing after she failed to show up for two appointments. ### New Canaan police released a statement saying they are classifying the case as both a missing persons case and a criminal case.

He is not the least bit stressed. ### And he has plenty of company among contenders at the Memorial for whom winning has become more of a memory than a habit. ### Kaymer was bogey-free Saturday at Muirfield Village for a 6-under 66 that gave him a two-shot lead over Adam Scott, setting up a final pairing of two major champions and former No. 1 players in the world in the midst of long droughts. ### Four shots behind and very much in the mix are Jordan Spieth — a three-time major champion and former No. 1 — and Hideki Matsuyama, both winless since 2017. Joining them was Patrick Cantlay with a skill set that suggests he should have more than his one victory that came in the fall of 2017. ### ""We can all play good golf, and it's quite nice for tomorrow because no one is really holding back,"" Kaymer said. ""I think you only hold back if you don't know the situation because then you don't know how to react and you play safe, defensive. ... No one is playing like that in that group."" ### Kaymer was at 15-under 201 in his first appearance at the Memorial in 10 years. ### The German was on the verge of falling out of the top 200 in the world ranking until a tie for eighth in the British Masters last month. His road back began with an emphasis on the short game, and it paid off in a big way on a course that slowly getting faster. ### He holed par putts of 8 feet and 20 feet on the front nine to keep within the leaders, took the lead with a wedge into 3 feet for birdie on the par-5 11th, saved par from a scary bunker shot behind the 12th green with water in front of him, and then holed a 35-foot birdie putt on No. 13 that breaks sharply over the last few feet. Spieth, playing with Kaymer, raised his putter as he watched it break, appreciating the difficulty of it. ### Scott had only one blemish on the ninth hole and did enough right to pile up birdies on the par 5s and a few other holes that he's in a spot to win again. A year ago, Scott left the Memorial and had to go through U.S. Open qualifying. While he hasn't won, he chased Brooks Koepka all the way to the finish line at Bellerive in the PGA Championship last summer and feels comfortable where he is. ### ""I'm just going to play as good as I can tomorrow,"" Scott said. ""I like where it's all at. I feel like the last few times I've been in with a chance, going back to the PGA Championship last year, I felt comfortable. So I'm not worried. I feel like this is the spot I'm meant to be. ... I feel like my game is at a level that if I put it all together properly and control myself out there, I can win."" ### Matsuyama won the Memorial in 2014, the start of his road to stardom. He finished strong on both nines to give himself a chance with a 64. ### Spieth has put together his best three-week stretch since the end of the 2017 season, and he was most pleased that he is keeping his tee shots in play and overcame some spotty iron play with a short game that appears to have returned full force. He finished with a 15-foot par putt on the 18th. ### ""Just trying to hit plenty of greens in regulation and let the flat stick work itself on Sunday,"" Spieth said. ### Cantlay, a former No. 1 amateur in the world whose career was slowly by a back injury so severe he thought he might not return, had a chance to win the Memorial last year when he took a two-shot lead into the back nine and then failed to make another birdie, missing a playoff by one shot. ### He had a 68 to give himself another chance. ### Tiger Woods also started strong by holing a bunker shot, nearly holing another and making the turn in 32. But on the 10th, his fairway bunker shot didn't get out and came back in his footprint, leading to a double bogey. That slowed momentum, and Woods finished with a bogey for a 70 that left him 11 shots out of the lead. ### Kaymer looked like a world beater in the summer of 2014 when he won The Players Championship in a Sunday duel against Spieth, and then won by eight shots at Pinehurst No. 2 for his second major. Where it all went is as mysterious as the game of golf, though Kaymer spoke about his focus being on the wrong things. ### He feels as though he's back, or close enough to contend in the U.S. Open in two weeks, and Sunday could be a barometer. Either way, he was satisfied with his game and his position and what he's done. ### ""Tomorrow is playing brave, playing the way I can play, enjoying the capability of my game,"" he said. ""Everything is there. I don't need to hold back with anything. I don't need to be afraid of something that could happen. I just look forward to whatever happens tomorrow.""",060119,1,"7:40 pm EDT, Saturday, June 1, 2019###Martin Kaymer, of Germany, tees off on the third hole during the third round of the Memorial golf tournament Saturday, June 1, 2019, in Dublin, Ohio.###Martin Kaymer, of Germany, tees off on the third hole during the third round of the Memorial golf tournament Saturday, June 1, 2019, in Dublin, Ohio.###Photo: Jay LaPrete, AP###Close###Image 1 of 10","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]","<p>7:40 pm EDT, Saturday, June 1, 2019</p><p>Martin Kaymer, of Germany, tees off on the third hole during the third round of the Memorial golf tournament Saturday, June 1, 2019, in Dublin, Ohio.</p><p>Martin Kaymer, of Germany, tees off on the third hole during the third round of the Memorial golf tournament Saturday, June 1, 2019, in Dublin, Ohio.</p><p>Photo: Jay LaPrete, AP</p><p>Close</p><p>Image 1 of 10</p>"
97719,"JTA riders don't embrace fare increases ###  ### Saturday ### Jun 1, 2019 at 12:01 AM Jun 1, 2019 at 12:34 PM ### People who spend hours each day on Jacksonville buses may be stuck paying more to get around the city despite not wanting an increase. ### Most have no other option. ### The Jacksonville Transportation Authority announced Tuesday it may increase fares for the first time since 2012. In a statement, the authority said any price changes will be reviewed to determine how price changes could impact some groups. ### Customers who depend on public transportation for everyday tasks can receive discounted or free passes while others may struggle to factor a slight increase into their budgets. ### Marlena Roberts would struggle. ### Roberts' typical day revolves around the bus. ### She waited Wednesday on the Green Line bus to arrive at the Rosa Parks Transit Station on Union Street downtown and take her family of four to a Dollar Tree. Since moving to Jacksonville from Atlanta a month ago, Roberts lives with her children Zoey, Amel and Tariq at the City Rescue Mission shelter. ### She spends, on average, 2½ hours daily on the bus. As a homeless mother, she said increasing bus fares will make her daily commute more difficult. ### If the increases go into effective, a single-trip fare will jump from $1.50 to $1.75, a one-day pass from $4 to $4.50, a three-day pass from $10 to $12, a seven-day pass from $16 to $20 and a 31-day pass from $50 to $65 among other changes. ### Roberts, 40, uses one-day passes, which currently cost $4. The proposed increased price would be $4.50. ### ""When I get $5, I can get back and forth like I want to,"" Roberts said. ### An increase would hurt. ""You're already struggling,"" she said. ### She primarily uses the Rosa Parks station to take her kids to day care, school and get to appointments and stores. Four to five times a day, she climbs on and off JTA buses. ### ""I understand they're dishing out for cleaner air, more routes. But I think there's a better way to do it,"" Roberts said. ""Some buses are running every five minutes. Maybe if you decrease some to every 10 minutes instead of five, that's not bad. You can save that way too."" ### Roberts said she hasn't experienced issues using JTA and enjoys her rides, but she already struggles to have enough money for her family. ### She worked the night shift at a Waffle House but quit since her family moved into City Rescue Mission shelter. She takes her kids to school, then day care and back to City Rescue Mission each day. ### When working the night shift, she took two buses to get there, the ride taking 45 minutes. To get Zoey, Amel and Tariq to school, requires another 15-minute route. ### If fares increase, Roberts could spend $3.50 more each week for her daily pass, not including her kids' fares as the prices are per rider. Roberts suggested single parents may be one group who will struggle with a fare increase. ### ""If this is your only transportation, it's hard,"" she said. ### Without the bus, Roberts said she would have trouble getting around the city. Though she doesn't want to see a fare increase, Roberts admitted the routes and buses are more efficient and prompt than what she was used to in Atlanta. ### ""I don't know how I would do it because you're going to have to get around, but it would be a pinch in my pocket,"" Roberts said. ""It's expensive already."" ### Public meetings to discuss fare changes for all fixed-route bus lines, First Coast Flyer routes, curb-to-curb service with ReadiRide and the St. Johns River Ferry will be held from June 10 to June 14. ### JTA said its outreach team will be at busy bus stops to collect feedback and answer questions starting Monday. Riders can find the outreach teams at the top three stops: the Rosa Parks station, Regency Square Hub and the Gateway Hub. From 6 a.m. to noon Monday and Thursday, an outreach team will be at the Rosa Parks station. A team will be at the Gateway Hub on Tuesday from 6 to 9 a.m. and at Regency Square from 6 to 9 a.m. Wednesday. ### The authority's board then will decide whether to hold a public hearing after talking to customers. If the board moves forward with the changes, a date for them to take effect will follow. ### ""The [fare] changes will allow the JTA to maintain sustainable financial plans in order to protect the authority from fluctuating sales, gas tax revenues and changes in consumer behavior,"" CEO Nathaniel Ford said when announcing the proposal Tuesday. ### After traveling from El Centro, Calif., to visit Key West, Jeff Burnette, 51, had less than $3 left in his pocket by Wednesday afternoon. ### He wouldn't typically consider a $4 one-day bus pass expensive, but since camping on beaches from the Keys up the coast, he sat at the Rosa Parks Station deciding whether sleep there for the night or head toward Neptune Beach. ### That trip would cost half of what money he had. For people in similar situations, Burnette said he would like to see JTA have a reduced fare for homeless and low-income riders. Through the MyJTAphone app, customers can access some of these reduced fares according to the statement. ### About 34,000 people use JTA's fixed-route bus lines on an average weekday. ### David Cawton, JTA spokesperson, said in an email any changes would not affect seniors 65 years and older, customers who use Connexion and Connexion Plus or the SkyWay. ### From December 2018 through April 2019, 7,507 riders have used the ReadiRide and 404,663 used the ferry services in 2018. ### In California, Burnette works at a feed store and a ranch and does odd jobs when he can. Each month he receives about $1,100 from a trust fund and used this month's money to travel, he said. ### Burnette only used JTA buses three times since coming to Florida in March. A large green backpack with a tent, Vienna sausage, a loaf of bread and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich inside accompanied him on the bench. He wasn't worried about starving, but he said he wasn't sure if he wanted to spend his money on the bus. ### ""Just ride it out until Friday morning,"" he said. ### The authority may include a 50 percent discount for college students. ### Anthony Nelson hopes to be included in that possible discount soon. The 23-year-old currently works in the kitchen at The Jacksonville Landing Hooters and plans to enroll at Florida State College at Jacksonville to pursue a music and business career. ### Nelson was headed to visit a friend on Jessie Street. He said he spends about $20 monthly on the bus, so a fare increase would not financially affect him. ### ""But it's things like that. Just going to go meet people, going to go meet friends,"" Nelson said. ""I use the bus just to go meet my friend."" ### Nelson said a fare increase may make those who don't entirely depend on public transportation more conscious about using it. But for people like him, they will find a way to continue to ride affordably. ### After 13-minute drive east of Union Street, a screen inside the Regency Square Hub sign displayed arrival times. A couple huddled around the screen that flashed one, two, 17 and 48 minutes until the upcoming arrivals. Behind the bus stop, cars sped by on Atlantic Boulevard while the buses inched in to come and go. ### Giovanny Rodriguez was one of a few people at the stop Thursday morning. ### The 19-year-old said he takes the Red Line toward downtown, transfers to another route and rides to Merrill Road before arriving at Lone Star High School. He is earning his diploma at the tuition-free high school after his grades suffered at Sandalwood High School due to attendance issues. ### The school provided Rodriguez with a monthly bus pass, so he said new fares aren't a main concern for him. ### ""It's not that much but it still adds up,"" he said. ### He relies on the bus because only one of his parents can drive, and he doesn't have a license yet. ### Steven James spends about 90 minutes a day on the bus for a drive that would take about 20 minutes to get to his job at Coop 303 in Neptune Beach. He takes two buses to get there with his seven-day pass, which costs him $16 weekly. The new cost could be $20, totaling about $80 monthly. ### James, a New York native, said he has seen much more substantial fare increases in New York, but he would like to see dispatchers or supervisors at high-frequency stops who log when certain drivers and routes are not on time. ### James said if JTA service is going to remain the same, ""it doesn't make sense to raise the fare if it's going to still be the same quality of service that they're giving."" ### ""[The fare increase] doesn't put me in no type of hole. They just need to have better service.""",060119,1,"Jun 1, 2019 at 12:01 AM Jun 1, 2019 at 12:34 PM###People who spend hours each day on Jacksonville buses may be stuck paying more to get around the city despite not wanting an increase.###Most have no other option.###The Jacksonville Transportation Authority announced Tuesday it may increase fares for the first time since 2012.

Picture: TwitterSource:ABC ### The team trekked into the heart of the Nanda Devi sanctuary “with the ambition of summiting a virgin peak”, adventure company Moran Mountain said in a Facebook post on May 12. ### The complete trip was expected to take about 24 days. ### The company on May 22 wrote the team had reached its second base camp at almost 5000 metres above sea level and “after a recce of the route, they will be making a summit attempt on an unclimbed peak at 6477m”. ### Ruth McCance had only just returned to climbing in “wild places” after previously feeling “overwhelmed by the risks”.Source:Supplied ### The expedition’s British deputy leader, Mark Thomas, remained at the second base camp with three others, according but was in radio contact with the group of eight that pushed higher. ### But when Mr Thomas didn’t hear anything after May 26 he went up to look for them. He reportedly found a single unoccupied tent. ### There was evidence of a large avalanche beyond that. ### Websites linked to Ms McCance reveal an avid adventurer and sailor. The corporate coach, in a blog post, revealed she gave up rock climbing at age 30 because she had “run out of mental and emotional reserves”. “As much as I loved it and saw others climbing safely and well, I became overwhelmed by the risks involved, so I stopped,” she wrote in May 2016 alongside a picture of a rocky cliff. ### “Each time I lead a climb successfully, rather than confirming my competence it became another lucky escape from what I believed was an inevitable accident.” But, at 47-years-old, she returned to the mountains in a bid to find “wild places that nourish my spirit for as long as my body will let me”. She recounted how a 23-day trek in India became “one of the most memorable” trips in her life and how her and a friend were “silenced” by the beauty of the mountains in France following her return to climbing. ### A hiker in the Himalayas.

A rescue team of up to 20 people - including members of the Indian-Tibetan border police and the state disaster management force - left Munsiyari on Saturday morning local time, Mr Chowdhury said. ### But it will take them at least three days on foot to reach the avalanche site.

Can you recommend some stocks that should perform well even if a recession hits? ### I don't want to suggest any individual stocks, but there are some good guidelines if you want to set your portfolio up for success during tough economic conditions. ### The most important thing is to focus on businesses that aren't terribly cyclical, or economically sensitive. In other words, businesses like luxury retailers, cruise lines, resorts, and automakers tend to do really well when the economy is strong, but not so well in bad economies, just to name a few examples. On the other hand, businesses like utilities and grocery stores tend to hold up far better, as these provide goods or services that people need no matter what the economy is doing. ### So if you're trying to build a recession-resistant portfolio, focus on stocks that provide needs, not wants, to consumers. ### Going a step further, you can actually identify some businesses that can do even better when the economy turns sour. For example, discount-oriented retailers were among the best performers during the Great Recession, as they benefited from bargain-seeking consumers. ### By focusing on companies that provide nondiscretionary products or services and businesses that sell things at a discount, your portfolio should be well-positioned to weather any economic storm. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}}  In fact, the newsletter they run, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has quadrupled the S&P 500!* ### Tom and David just revealed their ten top stock picks for investors to buy right now. ### *Stock Advisor returns as of Jan. 31, 2019. ### The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy . ### Subscribe to Breaking News ### Sign up!  ### Love",060119,1,"Ask a Fool: Which Stocks Will Perform Best During the Next Recession?###newsfeedback@fool.com (Matthew Frankel, CFP)###Save###Q: Most experts seem to agree that we're long overdue for a recession, so I want to prepare my portfolio.

A document was filed on 31 May by a woman in the 6th police station in Santo Amaro, a neighborhood outside of Sao Paulo. She is alleging that the incident occurred in Paris, and is not releasing her name at this time. ### According to a Google translation of the article, a friend of Neymar’s called Gallo facilitated a meeting between the two. ### In the document, obtained by UOL Sport, the accusation is that Neymar met the woman through the Instagram. After a conversation, it was agreed, through a friend of the player, called Gallo, that she would receive passage and lodging to travel to France to meet Neymar. According to the report, she stayed from May 15 at the Sofitel Paris Arc Du Triomphe and at around 8pm Neymar would have arrived drunk at the hotel. ### After exchanges of caresses the woman accused Neymar of being aggressive and, through violence, practiced sexual intercourse without the consent of the victim. She said in her testimony that she returned to Brazil on May 17 and that she was emotionally shaken and afraid to record the occurrence. ### Neymar’s legal team will review the document and comment later. Meanwhile, a police investigation has started . The Esporte article states that a Brazilian court can rule that the accusation could be defamation. According to RM Warner , a false accusation in Brazil can lead to heavy legal punishment, including three months to a year in jail. ### Neymar facing very serious allegations – Globo reporting he’s been accused of raping a woman in Paris.

The group and an alliance of non-governmental organisations have gathered in Istanbul to call attention to an escalation of violence in Idlib province in northwestern Syria. Salah said a catastrophic humanitarian crisis is imminent and the Syrian NGO Alliance appealed to the United Nations Security Council to stop the escalation. Lefteris Pitarakis AP Photo ### ISTANBUL ### Ankara and Moscow are again facing an escalation of violence in Syria's last rebel-held territory, a development that puts their cooperation to the test even as they support opposing sides in the eight-year war that has devastated Syria. ### An all-out offensive by Syrian government forces to capture Idlib in northwestern Syria from insurgents could unleash an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, for the area is home to 3 million people. ### Turkey, which is already hosting more than 3.6 million Syrian refugees, is facing strong pressure from Syria, Iran and Russia to deliver on its pledge to control the armed rebel factions in Idlib. ### But Turkey also needs Russia to rein in Syrian President Bashar Assad to prevent a massive outflow of refugees and to keep Turkish soldiers on the ground safe. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to Centre Daily Times content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin ""have an incentive to cooperate and ensure that nobody's interests are totally trampled,"" says Aaron Stein, the director of the Middle East program in American think-tank Foreign Policy Research Institute. ### In September, the two leaders brokered a cease-fire for Idlib in the Russian resort of Sochi, preventing a bloody onslaught, despite the fact that Russia has firmly backed Assad and Turkey supports opposition forces. Nine months later, the truce has failed. ### The agreement called for a 15-to-20 kilometer (9-to-12 mile) demilitarized zone free of insurgents and heavy weaponry and for two key highways crossing through Idlib to be reopened. The demilitarized zone has been breached and the highways are at the center of the current government offensive. ### Syrian ground forces have been advancing from the south of the rebel stronghold under the cover of Syrian and Russian airstrikes. ### The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said more than 291 civilians and 369 fighters have been killed since April 30 in the rebel stronghold. In the same period, 269 government troops and 22 civilians were killed in government areas by rebel fire. The U.N.'s children's agency said more than 130 children have reportedly been killed. ### Already, more than 200,000 people from the stronghold have been displaced, according to the U.N., with some seeking safety near the border with Turkey while others crammed into crowded camps in Syria. ### Turkey has accused the Syrian government of violating the cease-fire and Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said the country has told Russia ""the regime must be controlled."" ### Russia has launched airstrikes in Idlib and is providing air cover in the Syrian government offensive. It has complained that the militants have increasingly been targeting its military base in the nearby coastal province of Latakia. ### But for now, Moscow is unlikely to support an all-out Syrian operation in Idlib because the benefits of a long-term alliance with Turkey outweigh one military battle. ### ""Russia doesn't want to ruin its relationship with Turkey because of Idlib,"" says Kirill Semenov, a Moscow-based Middle East analyst and expert at the Russian International Affairs Council. ### In late April, Putin said he would not rule out a large-scale assault but ""together with our Syrian friends, we believe that this would not be advisable"" due to humanitarian issues. ### Still, Russia's patience is wearing thin with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which it accuses of targeting its military base. HTS is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Russia and Turkey, despite its claims it has disassociated from al-Qaida. ### Top Russian officials have often called Idlib a ""breeding ground for terrorists."" ### Despite the cease-fire deal, Turkey has been unable to neutralize the extremists. Much of Idlib has come under the control of HTS, which has defeated Turkey-backed armed groups. ### Emre Ersan, an associate professor of international relations and political science at Istanbul's Marmara University, believes Turkey may have overestimated its influence over HTS. He says Turkey's plan to split the group and absorb its more moderate members has not worked. ### Instead, HTS has used Turkey as leverage against Russia and Assad-supporter Iran, according to Ersan. ### Adding to the risks, Turkish troops are in the line of fire. Two Turkish soldiers were wounded in early May in a Syrian government artillery attack on an observation post. Three other attacks have been cited by Turkey's official Anadolu Agency, raising questions if the attacks were accidental or designed to pressure Ankara with Russia's knowledge. ### ""The Turkish Armed Forces will not take a single step back from where it is,"" Akar, Turkey's defense minister, said last week. ### Erdogan and Putin have talked on the phone, agreeing to continue working along the lines of the cease-fire agreement to prevent civilian deaths and a refugee flow. They also agreed to meet on the sidelines of next month's Group of 20 conference in Japan. ### ""Apart from this dialogue and cooperation, there is nothing on the ground that can prevent a catastrophe in Idlib,"" Ersan says. ### The presidents have become close since 2016, rebuilding their relations after a dramatic crisis in 2015 when Turkey shot down a Russian jet near the Syrian border. Their rapport comes amid Turkey's fragile relations with NATO ally United States, especially over Washington's support of Syrian Kurdish-led forces who control large swaths in eastern Syria. Ankara considers them an extension of a Kurdish insurgency operating inside Turkey. ### Erdogan is so far sticking to his promise to buy Russian-made S-400 missiles despite U.S. warnings the system would jeopardize Turkey's participation in the F-35 fighter jet program and compromise its safety. Stein calls this ""a big win for Russia."" Turkey is angling for a way to have both the S-400s and the F-35s. ### Turkey is also talking with the U.S. about a safe zone in northeastern Syria and has repeatedly asked for the U.S. to end its military support for Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. Erdogan will meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the G-20 as well. ### Ersan believes Russia may allow Turkey to grab the northern town of Tel Rifaat from the Kurdish fighters, the last town they control in western Syria. Russian support could help Turkey put pressure on the SDF, widen Turkish influence and strengthen its hand in ongoing negotiations with the U.S. ### In exchange, he argues, Turkey could be open to some limited Syrian operation toward Idlib. ### _",060119,1,"Adding to the risks, Turkish troops are in the line of fire.

50338,"POLITICO ### Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ### SAN FRANCISCO — Sen. Kamala Harris on Saturday pushed back at the emerging narrative that she’s been too timid while campaigning for president, using a POLITICO interview to challenge her naysayers to come watch her field questions on the road. ### Harris’ uneven national TV appearances, in particular a pair of CNN town halls, have drawn repeated critiques from former top Obama strategist David Axelrod, now an influential political commentator and podcast host from his perch as director of the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. ### Story Continued Below ### Last month, after Harris vacillated on several CNN questions — including whether violent felons should be allowed to vote — Axelrod predicted the California senator's lack of directness could backfire. ### “She is an incredibly compelling personality; a very bright and accomplished person,” he said in post-town hall analysis that aired on CNN. “But she’s very cautious — and that caution was pretty apparent in a lot of her answers.” ### In a Los Angeles Times report Friday, Axelrod credited Harris for her tough questions during Senate hearings, but again pounded away at the impression that she plays it too safe. ### “She’s a brilliant person, there’s no doubt about that,” Axelrod told the newspaper. “But what we’ve learned so far is that she’s great at asking questions but timid at answering them. She’s going to have to correct that to navigate this process.” ### The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage.  You can unsubscribe at any time. ### Asked by POLITICO about Axelrod’s concerns — part of a line of criticism that Harris aides and allies broadly believe is tinged with sexism and not applied in the same way to the men running for president — Harris paused for a few seconds before saying, “I don’t know what to tell you."" ### “Axelrod was on the road with Barack a decade ago,” she added. “I’ve invited him to come on the road with me ... (and he’d see) “contrary to what he thinks is happening.” ### As for whether the critiques of her are grounded in sexism, Harris said some of those making the charges about her “should do a better job of performing themselves.” ### Despite the slip-ups, Harris has been fairly crisp at campaign events — and her supporters contend that when her Democratic rivals have been evasive, they’ve received praise for their ability to parry tough issues. They note that unlike some others — particularly Sen. Bernie Sanders, but also former vice president Joe Biden during the early weeks of his bid — she regularly takes questions from reporters and voters. ### And Harris, some argue in a rosier assessment of the candidate, takes the time to consider an issue, unlike President Donald Trump and his shoot-from-the-hip style. ### Axelrod pointed out that national media narratives around a candidate are largely shaped by mass media. ### “Most folks are not on the road, so how a candidate presents on TV matters,” he wrote after POLITICO tweeted Harris’ response. “I was just commenting on what I see. That said, it is early. @KamalaHarris is certainly in the thick of this race.” ### Some allies, though, wished she’d responded differently. ### “I would have said, ‘What did he say? I didn’t read it,’” said Willie Brown, the former San Francisco. “‘Axel-who?’”",060119,1,"SAN FRANCISCO — Sen.

The top two teams from each of the six groups will qualify for the Round of 16, as will the top four third-place sides. ### 16 December 2015: Abby Wambach #20 of the United States reacts to a play during an exhibition game against China at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, LA. (Photo by Tyler Kaufman/Icon Sportswire) (Icon Sportswire via AP Images) Photo Credit: AP/Tyler Kaufman ### In contrast to Canada 2015, which was played on artificial turf, France 2019 will use honest-to-goodness green grass. ### The Lewis rankings ### The eighth WWC boasts the most competitive field of all tournaments since it began in 1991. You can make a case for several teams to take the victory lap at Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Lyon on July 7. ### 1. The defending champion U.S., No. 1 in the FIFA rankings, is the team to beat.  ### 2. As hosts, talented France faces pressure to go deep in the tournament and wants to emulate its men, who captured last year's World Cup in Russia. ### 3. Rio 2016 Olympic gold medalist Germany is always a threat, no matter what players it fields. ### 4. A solid Australia side is buoyed by the amazing Sam Kerr, who can change games in an instant. ### FILE - In this Oct. 14, 2018, file photo, Canada forward Christine Sinclair celebrates after scoring a goal in the second half of a soccer match at the CONCACAF women's World Cup qualifying tournament against Panama in Frisco, Texas.

England hopes winning the 2019 SheBelieves Cup in the U.S. is a harbinger of things to come. ### 7. Canada, which underachieved with a quarterfinal elimination as 2015 hosts, has much to prove. ### 8. Brazil, behind the fabulous Marta (WWC-record 15 goals), can't be counted out because of its imposing individual talent, but historically falls short. ### Mandatory Credit: Photo by JUSTIN LANE/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock (10247504i) United States women's national soccer team players Alex Morgan (L) and Megan Rapinoe (R) attend the media day leading up to the upcoming 2019 FIFA Women World Cup soccer tournament in New York, New York, USA, 24 May 2019.

Sweden has been a thorn in the Americans' side, having eliminated them in the 2016 Rio quarterfinals. ### 10. Much-improved and darkhorse Spain should not be taken lightly. ### Trying for a fourth ### The U.S., winners of record three world championships (1991, 1999, 2015), tries to duplicate Germany’s feat as back-to-back champions (2003 and 2007). After their first two titles, the Americans were a disappointing third. While many teams would love to finish that high, anything less than a championship would be considered a failure. They want to prove what transpired at the 2016 Olympics was an aberration. It was the first time in 13 FIFA-sponsored competitions they failed to reach the semifinals. If history repeats itself in France, get ready for some fireworks. ### MONTREAL, QC - JUNE 09: Marta #10 of Brazil reacts to a call during the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Group E match against Korea Republic at Olympic Stadium on June 9, 2015 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Ettie is a French baby name that means ""keeper of the hearth; rules her household."" ### A team for the ages or for the aged? ### In 2003, the Americans deployed a team that averaged 27 years and six months, finishing a disappointing third. In 2015, the U.S. had one of the oldest teams (28), yet won. The 2019 squad is the oldest of this year's tourney, averaging 29, compared to the average age of the 24 teams (26 years, six months). Brazil is second at 28 years and five months. ### FILE - In this April 5, 2018, file photo, United States' Allie Long (20) blocks Mexico's Renae Cuellar (21) path to the goal during the second half of an international friendly soccer match, in Jacksonville, Fla.

Solo, fired from the team for her off-the-pitch headlines and critical comments, was one of the best women's goalkeepers ever, winning one WWC and two Olympic gold medals. While Naeher has looked solid, she never has been battle-tested on the biggest stage in the world. Can Naeher make the big save as Solo did so many times? If she can, the U.S. can go far. ### The LI connection ### Three players who honed their skills in the Long Island Junior Soccer League will make their WWC debuts. Left back Crystal Dunn (Rockville Centre), a highly versatile player, and midfielder Allie Long (Northport), who can give the team flexibility by playing in the back, will try to help the U.S. defend its crown. Dunn gives the USA a unique attacking option from the back, though she is not a polished defender. Long is trying to crack a talented midfield. Goalkeeper Nicole McClure, born in Jamaica, Queens, backstopped for the East Meadow Shooting Stars and Auburndale S.C. and hopes to see action for the Jamaicans. ### NASHVILLE, TN - MARCH 02: Crystal Dunn #19 of the USA plays in the 2019 SheBelieves Cup match between USA and England at Nissan Stadium on March 2, 2019 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Photo by Frederick Breedon/Getty Images) Photo Credit: Getty Images/Frederick Breedon ### Players to watch (USA) ### Striker Alex Morgan, whose effectiveness in the 2015 WWC was hampered by a knee injury, is healthy. Megan Rapinoe, who turns 34 on July 5, has her brilliant moments. But can she be an impact player in seven games over 27 days (the USA's opener is the latest start date, June 11)? Forward Tobin Heath doesn't look imposing but is one tough cookie. Carli Lloyd, the 2015 Golden Boot winner, has been relegated to the bench as a super-sub (she's 36). She'll be out to prove coach Jill Ellis wrong and could become a lethal weapon down the stretch. ### Players to watch (the rest of the world) ### Aussie striker Sam Kerr is a human highlight reel and a delight to watch, turning ordinary plays into spectacular goals. Canada striker Christine Sinclair turns 36 on June 12, but she still has some magic left as she’s three goals shy of Abby Wambach's all-time international record (184). French captain Amandine Henry (no relation to Thierry Henry), and the 2015 Silver Ball winner, can do it all on both sides of the ball. Japan midfielder Saki Kumagai, who plays for French powerhouse Olympique Lyonnais, is revered in her home country for scoring the winning PK in the 2011 final. Defender Lucy Bronze, the backbone of England's 2015 third-place finish, was dubbed the best player in the world by coach Phil Neville. ### Games to watch ### England vs. Scotland (Group D) on June 9, Germany vs. Spain (Group B) on June 12, Australia vs. Brazil (Group C) on June 13 on June 19 and U.S. vs. Sweden (Group F) on June 20. If form holds, the game of the tournament could be the USA vs. France in the quarterfinals in Parc des Princes Stadium in Paris on June 28. It would be a shame to see one of those teams eliminated early, but you can blame FIFA for this scheduling anomaly. ### Where fans are going to watch ### Unlike the 1998 men's World Cup in which there were 15 matches in Paris, this tournament won't revolve around the capital. Paris will host seven games with other contests in Nice, Montpellier, Rennes, Le Havre, Valenciennes, Reims, Grenoble and Lyon, which will host only three matches (July 2 and 3 semifinals and July 7 final). ### GROUP F SCHEDULE ### Chile vs. Sweden – June 11, noon ### United States vs. Thailand – June 11, 3 p.m. ### Sweden vs. Thailand – June 16, 9 a.m ### United States vs. Chile – June 16, 12 p.m. ### United States vs. Sweden – June 20, 3 p.m. ### Thailand vs. Chile – June 20 , 3 p.m. ### By Michael Lewis Special to Newsday",060119,1,"Sweden vs. Thailand – June 16, 9 a.m###United States vs. Chile – June 16, 12 p.m.###United States vs. Sweden – June 20, 3 p.m.###Thailand vs. Chile – June 20 , 3 p.m.###By Michael Lewis Special to Newsday","[133, 134, 135, 136, 137]","<p>Sweden vs. Thailand – June 16, 9 a.m</p><p>United States vs. Chile – June 16, 12 p.m.</p><p>United States vs. Sweden – June 20, 3 p.m.</p><p>Thailand vs. Chile – June 20 , 3 p.m.</p><p>By Michael Lewis Special to Newsday</p>"

73793,"Patrick Kane and fellow Blackhawks star Jonathan Toews are inspirations for many prospective NHL forwards. ### Getty ### BUFFALO, N.Y. — On and on they went, all weekend long, naming Chicago Blackhawks legends. ### And not Stan Mikita or Bobby Hull, either. ### Alex Turcotte, an Island Lake, Illinois, native projected to be a top-five pick in this year’s NHL draft: “I bring the same qualities as [Jonathan] Toews, and I compete and play a 200-foot game. I want to be there and be similar to him one day.” ### Trevor Zegras, a New York native and another likely top-10 pick: “Growing up, watching a lot of hockey, my favorite player was Patrick Kane, and his passes are way better than mine. I’m just trying to do what I can to emulate a little bit of him.” ### Toews and Kane were popular names in Buffalo, even though neither has participated in an actual NHL combine for over a decade. ### For these 18-year-old prospects, who came of age right when the Hawks’ dynasty began in 2010, they’re more like larger-than-life role models than soon-to-be teammates — though for at least one combine attendee, Kane and Toews will soon be both. ### “[Toews is] definitely an idol of mine, watching the Hawks all the way up,” Turcotte added. “I’d be lucky just half as good as him.” ### The Hawks’ two most recognizable forwards weren’t the only current stars receiving shoutouts. Defenseman Marshall Warren, another New York native and projected middle-round pick, mentioned Duncan Keith as his favorite NHL player. ### NHL draft prospects completed numerous physical testing drills in Buffalo on Saturday. ### Podkolzin emphasizes commitment to NHL ### Russian winger Vasili Podkolzin, once a popular Blackhawks pick in mock drafts but now thought to be trending towards the middle of the first round, stressed Saturday that he fully intends to come to North America once his KHL contract expires in two years. ### “Of course he understand why they’re scared [of the contract situation] — there is that ‘Russian factor’ — but he’s actually excited to develop in these next two years and be ready for the NHL,” he said through a translator. ### Podkolzin experienced a tumultuous 2018-19, playing at three different levels within the SKA St. Petersburg organization and also on two different Russian national junior teams, but has shown a lot of rough-around-the-edges promise. He’s a tenacious net-driver with good puckhandling ability and playmaking skill. ### Still, even a mere two years’ wait will deter some teams, but Hawks director of scouting Mark Kelley has downplayed that factor of the Podkolzin decision. ### “Realistically, when you talk about all these players, none of them are going to be really impact players for the next two seasons, so it becomes a little short-sighted if you’re saying that,” Kelley said. “Some of these players might play in the next two years, but their real impact is going to three, four years down the road.” ### Next Up In Blackhawks",060119,1,"BUFFALO, N.Y. — On and on they went, all weekend long, naming Chicago Blackhawks legends.###And not Stan Mikita or Bobby Hull, either.###Alex Turcotte, an Island Lake, Illinois, native projected to be a top-five pick in this year’s NHL draft: “I bring the same qualities as [Jonathan] Toews, and I compete and play a 200-foot game.

With 10 earned runs allowed in his past two starts, German’s ERA has ballooned by more than a full run to 3.66. ### The Royals had hit four homers and scored seven earned runs in five innings against German in another no-decision last Sunday, but Aaron Boone said before Saturday’s start, “I still feel like he’s throwing the ball really well.” ### The manager also didn’t believe the 26-year-old righthander’s confidence was shaken by what easily was his rockiest outing of the season. ### “No, because I think he understands how good he is and still can be,” Boone said before the game. “And I think the ability, he knows he’s got three pitches that he can strike in any count, three above-average major league pitches that he can strike in any count. I think that gives him comfort. And I expect him to go out against a very tough lineup and if he makes his pitches, he has a chance to have real success.” ### German struck out Andrew Benintendi and Rafael Devers on curveballs in the first inning and fanned three more despite surrendering a run on three singles in the second. ### After the Yankees gave him a 3-1 lead with five singles in the bottom half, German whiffed Benintendi and Devers again in the third for seven strikeouts through three innings (of his eight overall).  ### Sign up ### By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy . ### But Xander Bogaerts tagged German’s hanging changeup for a solo homer to left in the fourth, an inning he would not survive. Brock Holt followed Bogaerts’ blast with a single and scored later in the inning on Sandy Leon’s full-count single to center to tie it. Reliever Chad Green replaced German and recorded the final out of the frame to maintain the tie. ### German’s recent shakiness only underscores the likelihood that the first-place Yankees will seek to upgrade their starting rotation ahead of the July 31 trade deadline. Free agent Dallas Keuchel remains unsigned and Madison Bumgarner — a proven postseason performer — and others figure to be available on the trade market. ### Severino, a 19-game winner in 2018, hasn’t made a start this season because of rotator cuff inflammation in his right shoulder and a lat injury, and lefties James Paxton and CC Sabathia also have spent time on the injured list. Paxton (knee) returned from the injured list with four shutout innings Wednesday against San Diego; Sabathia (knee) is slated to be activated to start the series finale against Boston on Sunday night. ### By Peter Botte Special to Newsday",060119,1,"“ No, because I think he understands how good he is and still can be,” Boone said before the game. “ And I think the ability, he knows he ’s got three pitches that he can strike in any count, three above-average major league pitches that he can strike in any count.

Should the government start regulating sales? ### Today 9:15 AM ### By Jonathan D.

NJ Cannabis Insider features exclusive, premium content for those interested in getting in on the ground floor or expanding their operation. View a sample issue . ### WASHINGTON — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration heard Friday from more than 100 people representing marijuana businesses, lawyers, state agencies and patient groups as it considers whether, or how, to regulate hemp-derived cannabidiol, better known as CBD. ### The day-long hearing came at a time when manufacturers are adding CBD to numerous consumer products and some are making unsubstantiated health claims about the ingredient. The agency also is accepting written comments through July 2. ### “Finally, the federal government is taking meaningful steps to get a grasp on the industry,” said Mike McQueeny, who co-chairs Genova Burns’ cannabis law practice group. “Regulation takes time and in the interim there is a huge flood of products in the marketplace.” ### Legislation allowing banks to provide services to legal cannabis businesses is likely to be the first marijuana-related bill signed into law if it can pass the Senate. ### While hemp, the non-psychoactive cousin of marijuana, was legalized in the 2018 farm bill, the FDA said the bill specifically preserved its authority to regulate all products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. ### A lot is riding on the FDA’s decision. The National Cannabis Industry Association estimated that the CBD industry could grow to $16 billion in five years, directly or indirectly supporting as many as 278,000 jobs. ### “Hemp-derived CBD products are in very high consumer demand and the industry is eagerly awaiting FDA’s regulatory framework for these products,"" said Andrew Kline, the NCIA’s policy director. ""We strongly recommend that FDA act quickly to clarify the regulatory environment because there is significant confusion in the market.” ### The FDA already has approved hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein and hemp seed oil in products such as soups, dips, baked goods, snacks and nutrition bars. ### But companies can’t tout the unproven health benefits of CBD, and the FDA said in announcing the hearing that it had taken action against companies selling products that claimed to prevent or treat diseases or were marketed as dietary supplements. ### “Selling unapproved drug products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims is not only a violation of the law, but also can put patients at risk as the marketing of unproven treatments raises significant public health concerns,” the FDA said. ### McQueeny and Charles Messina, the other Genova Burns co-chair, said there are many other issues for the FDA to address, such as setting standard doses of CBD, looking at whether warnings need to be placed on labels, establishing expiration dates for products, and ensuring that manufacturing processes for cannabidiol products do not contain THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana. ### The FDA isn’t the only agency involved. The U.S. Agriculture Department said it will regulate hemp production and Congress could decide to act as well. ### Jonathan D. Salant may be reached at jsalant@njadvancemedia.com .

50302,"Scandal, indictments, promises of reform: Will Ald. Edward Burke’s indictment bring real change? ### Jose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune ### Ald. Edward Burke, 14th, attends a City Council meeting in Chicago on May 29, 2019. ### Ald. Edward Burke, 14th, attends a City Council meeting in Chicago on May 29, 2019. (Jose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune) ### Privacy Policy ### For decades and decades, Chicago’s City Council has followed a cycle as predictable as the seasons: scandal, indictments, promises of reform. Scandal, indictments, promises of reform. ### After the latest indictment, this time of Ald. Edward Burke , new Mayor Lori Lightfoot says things will be different. But she knows she’s butting up against history and tradition. ### “Council exists in a world that’s a little bit different than, I think, ordinary citizens. I hope that there is distress and concern about what the indictment suggests is the way in which Ald. Burke conducted himself as a matter of course over many, many years,” Lightfoot said. “And I hope this is a cautionary tale for any alderman, particularly the newly minted aldermen, that this is not the path they should go on.” ### Since 1972, 30 Chicago aldermen have gone to prison for various acts of public corruption. The Silver Shovel series of indictments in the 1990s ensnared six aldermen for pocketing bribes. And Hired Truck in the 2000s caught city officials trading jobs and promotions for campaign help. ### The latest scandal to rattle City Hall was outlined Thursday in a federal indictment against Burke , for racketeering and other alleged abuses of power. ### For Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, Burke’s legal problems helped catapult her from a long-shot candidate to mayor as she battered better-known opponents with ties to him en route to winning each of the city’s 50 wards. ### Now, Lightfoot says city leaders must approach this scandal differently . There’s “great desire all across the city for change,” she says. ### “Folks need to get the message. This is a different day, and we’re not going to stand for people who compromise themselves, a lack of integrity in the discharge of their responsibilities,” Lightfoot said. “It’s not going to happen, and I’m going to do everything I can to stand for a different set of standards and hopefully encourage other elected officials, other appointed officials, to model this behavior.” ### The 59-page indictment against Burke outlined a series of alleged schemes in which prosecutors say the 50-year alderman abused his City Hall clout to extort private legal work from companies and individuals doing business with the city. ### Mayor Lori Lightfoot calls on Ald. Edward Burke to resign after corruption indictment » ### According to the indictment, Burke was meeting with then-Ald. Daniel Solis in October 2017 when he allegedly expressed his displeasure over the way developers of the old main Chicago post office had so far failed to throw any business to Burke’s private law firm. ### “As far as I’m concerned, they can go f--- themselves,”  Burke told Solis, who was working undercover for the FBI and secretly recording the conversation, the indictment said. ### In addition to the attempted extortion of the old post office developers, the 14-count indictment accuses Burke of trying to muscle developers of two smaller projects into hiring his law firm as well. ### Burke has denied wrongdoing. ### Speaking about the Burke indictment, Lightfoot said it “marks another moment of reckoning for us as a city and us elected officials to think about what it means to be a public servant, think about what integrity in government means.” ### “That indictment is pretty devastating,” Lightfoot said. “It paints a yearslong series of criminal activities that were done as a matter of course.” ### Even before prosecutors unveiled the new allegations, Lightfoot made ethics reform a centerpiece of her administration, campaigning against Chicago’s reputation for graft and promising in her inaugural address that “restoring trust in our city’s government and finally bringing some real integrity to the way this city works” would be a top priority. ### Jose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune ### Mayor Lori Lightfoot chats with new Ald. Daniel La Spata, 1st, left, as they both arrive for their first City Council meeting in Chicago on May 29, 2019. ### Mayor Lori Lightfoot chats with new Ald. Daniel La Spata, 1st, left, as they both arrive for their first City Council meeting in Chicago on May 29, 2019. (Jose M. Osorio/Chicago Tribune) ### Already, there’s a rash of proposals. Lightfoot said this week she wants to pass restrictions to prevent officials from profiting off their elected positions, strengthen the city inspector general’s office and raise penalties for ethics violations, all during her first 100 days. ### The Board of Ethics also proposed banning aldermen from representing clients in Cook County property tax cases, an expanded nepotism ban and new limits on campaign contributions, among other measures. ### But passing a meaningful reform package could be a challenge, as some aldermen’s private businesses may be affected by restrictions on the sort of work they do in their private time, and not everyone in the City Council shares the former federal prosecutor’s zeal for criticizing how Chicago works. ### Still, several aldermen said it’s time for meaningful change. ### “Words are not enough. Anything that we can say can only be exercised through action,” said Ald. George Cardenas, 12th. “Changing our ethics, our rules, and restoring public integrity is our priority. That’s where we’re at right now. It’s the beginning, not the end, of those efforts.” ### Ald. Michele Smith, 43rd, who heads the newly created ethics committee under Lightfoot, said the allegations against Burke “highlight the reasons for many of the ethics reforms that we are proposing.” ### “If proven, this is of course criminal activity, but we’re committed to working together to change the reputation of our City Council,” Smith said. ### Ald. Scott Waguespack, 32nd, Lightfoot’s pick to take over as chairman of the Finance Committee that Burke ran for decades, said the indictment supports Lightfoot in her crusade. ### “It’s pretty clear, looking at the ethics changes Mayor Lightfoot’s pushing and the changes she talked about at her inauguration that got loud applause from the crowd, that she’s going in the right direction that Chicagoans are demanding to stamp this kind of behavior out,” Waguespack said. ### Ordinances can’t single-handedly eliminate corruption, Waguespack said, but they can help make changes in a town that’s seen dozens of aldermen go to prison in recent decades. ### “Maybe you can’t kill the whole hydra, but you have a responsibility to tighten the rules on lobbying and conflicts of interest as much as possible,” the alderman said. “Somebody can always try to find a way to commit these kinds of crimes, but we can try to cut off as many avenues as we can.” ### The indictment against Burke came a day after Lightfoot’s public tangle with him at her first City Council meeting — when Lightfoot silenced him during a tense exchange. Burke tried to lodge a complaint about the use of “he” instead of gender-neutral pronoun constructions in Lightfoot’s proposed package of City Council rules. ### But Lightfoot cut him off. “Sir, we’ll take your issue under advisement, we’re going to move forward,” she said. ### When Burke tried to make another point, Lightfoot stopped him short: “Alderman, please. Alderman, I will call you when I’m ready to hear from you.” ### Cardenas said Lightfoot now carries a more forceful position in the city after the encounter. ### “The rules that are so abused by Ald. Burke, and others perhaps, must be curtailed tremendously and used and exercised only when it merits,” Cardenas said. “Her hand is strong. At the end of the day, the public is demanding change, the public is demanding action, and I think that’s what’s happening.” ### New Ald. Byron Sigcho Lopez, who succeeded  Solis after revelations that the powerful former Zoning chair wore a wire against Burke, said the sort of schemes Burke is alleged to have tried have repercussions all over Chicago. ### “This type of corruption affects the way small businesses can operate across the city,” Sigcho Lopez, 25th, said. “That’s why I support the efforts of the mayor to try to change the way the City Council operates. It’s obviously a shame this happened. Now it’s up to us to try to change it.” ### He said reform is “at the top of my agenda and of many other new members of the council.” ### Fellow freshman Ald. Samantha Nugent, 39th, said she’s eager to serve on the ethics committee to help make changes. ### “I support reform,” Nugent said. “I want to make sure that we can do our job and that the city can have confidence in us because they know we’re adhering to a strict moral compass and following the rules.” ### Longtime Ald. Patrick O’Connor, who lost his re-election campaign in April, said he doesn’t think the indictment will change much of the council’s dynamic from what it’s been since Burke was charged in January. ### But O’Connor, who had a long relationship with Burke and served as floor leader for former mayors Rahm Emanuel and Richard M. Daley added, “I feel bad for the city. I feel bad for the individuals that are involved, I think it’s just unfortunate all the way around.” ### Echoing O’Connor, Ald. Carrie Austin, 34th, said she was “saddened” to hear the news of her colleague’s indictment. ### “I’m sorry that to hear that about Ed, because I’ve worked with him for the last 24 years and I’m saddened that it’s sunk to that because I did have a great amount of respect for him,” said Austin, the city’s second longest-serving alderman behind Burke. “I’ll say it like how my mother said: ‘When you’re wrong, wrong will follow you.’ ” ### Former Ald. Joe Moore, who in April’s election lost the seat he’d held for 28 years, said the indictment and surrounding controversy gives Lightfoot “an upper hand against the City Council.” ### “She’s used Burke’s problems effectively to basically have the City Council bend to her authority. There’s been very little pushback on her efforts to rein in so-called aldermanic prerogative,” Moore said. “I think there’s a good chance that she’ll be able to use this effectively to rein in their power over zoning.” ### Moore said the ongoing criminal cases and revelations about Solis wearing a wire could heighten already palpable mistrust among aldermen. ### “I think most of my former colleagues would already be pretty circumspect not only in talking with their colleagues but with anyone else, for that matter, that they don’t know or even those they do know,” Moore said. “Frankly, hopefully it scares them into not doing anything improper. That would be the public benefit to all of this.” ### At a news  conference Friday where she reiterated her call for Burke to resign, Lightfoot said the long history of aldermen going to prison should be enough of a “cautionary tale.” ### “But clearly sometimes power intoxicates people and makes them lose their way and their north star,” Lightfoot said. ### Lightfoot said her administration will be rolling out more ethics proposals for the City Council to consider. But Lightfoot, who personally prosecuted corrupt Ald. Virgil Jones as part of Silver Shovel, acknowledged that change will need more than new ordinances. ### “Fundamentally, if somebody wants to violate the law, and thinks that it’s their right to monetize their position, there’s not much that we can do, but that’s why we need the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office to be diligent,” Lightfoot said. “I don’t want the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office to in effect be our HR manager, but there is a need for law enforcement, because people aren’t getting the message.”",060119,1,"“ As far as I’m concerned, they can go f--- themselves,”  Burke told Solis, who was working undercover for the FBI and secretly recording the conversation, the indictment said.###In addition to the attempted extortion of the old post office developers, the 14-count indictment accuses Burke of trying to muscle developers of two smaller projects into hiring his law firm as well.###Burke has denied wrongdoing.###Speaking about the Burke indictment, Lightfoot said it “ marks another moment of reckoning for us as a city and us elected officials to think about what it means to be a public servant, think about what integrity in government means. ”","[44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]","<p>“ As far as I’m concerned, they can go f--- themselves,”  Burke told Solis, who was working undercover for the FBI and secretly recording the conversation, the indictment said.</p><p>In addition to the attempted extortion of the old post office developers, the 14-count indictment accuses Burke of trying to muscle developers of two smaller projects into hiring his law firm as well.</p><p>Burke has denied wrongdoing.</p><p>Speaking about the Burke indictment, Lightfoot said it “ marks another moment of reckoning for us as a city and us elected officials to think about what it means to be a public servant, think about what integrity in government means. ”</p>"

(AP) - Alabama lawmakers ended the 2019 legislative session on Friday. Here’s a look at some of the proposals that passed and failed this year. ### WHAT WAS APPROVED: ### ___ ### GAS TAX ### Gov. Kay Ivey called lawmakers into special session to approve the gas tax increase to fund road and bridge construction. The 10-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase will be phased in over three years beginning with a six-cent increase on Sept. 1 ### ___ ### ABORTION BAN ### The ban makes it a felony to perform an abortion unless the mother’s life is in danger. It is anticipated that it will be blocked by the courts. A lawsuit has been filed challenging the ban. ### ___ ### THIRD GRADE READING ### The legislation will require third graders to meet reading benchmarks before moving to fourth grade. The bill also spells out initiatives, such as requiring regional reading specialists to work with struggling students, to boost test scores. ### __ ### STATE SCHOOL BOARD ### Alabama voters will decide next year whether they want to abolish the elected state school board and replace it with a nine-member commission. Members would be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Alabama Senate. ### ___ ### PAY RAISES FOR TEACHERS, OTHERS ### Teachers and other public school employees will receive a 4% pay raise. State employees will receive a 2% raise. Lawmakers also voted to raise the pay for correctional officers as the state faces a federal court order to add officers. ### ___ ### PAROLE BOARD OVERHAUL ### The bill makes multiple changes at the state parole board, including making a gubernatorial appointee who could be dismissed at will by the governor. The board currently hires the director. ### ___ ### EQUAL PAY ### The legislation prohibits businesses from paying workers less than employees of another race or sex for the same work unless there are reasons such as seniority, a merit system or productivity to account for the difference. ### ___ ### JAIL FOOD ### Alabama lawmakers voted to end a practice that allowed some sheriffs to pocket leftover jail food funds. The bill requires the food allowance to go into a separate account that can only be used for feeding prisoners. ### ___ ### CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE ### The measures would track how often prosecutors use civil actions to seize a person’s property for suspected criminal activity. State prosecutors agreed this year to track the forfeitures, but the legislation would mandate it. ### ___ ### MEDICAL MARIJUANA STUDY COMMISSION ### Lawmakers voted to create a medical marijuana commission that would make recommendations for legislation that lawmakers might consider in 2020. ### ___ ### BROADBAND ACCESS ### The governor signed into law two bills aimed at expanding broadband access. One bill expands an existing grant program for broadband providers in rural communities. Another allows electricity providers to use existing infrastructure to provide broadband services. ### ___ ### MARRIAGE LICENSES ### Marriage licenses would be replaced with a new form called a marriage certificate. The change comes after several probate judges stopped issuing marriage licenses so they don’t have to give them to gay couples. Judges wouldn’t have to sign the new forms before a wedding. ### ___ ### BACKSEAT SEATBELTS ### The measure would require a person to wear a seat belt in the backseat of a moving vehicle. The legislation is named for a Montgomery teen killed in a car crash. ### ___ ### ___ ### LOTTERY ### A proposal to start a state lottery cleared the Alabama Senate, but it did not get a vote in the House. ### ___ ### PERMITLESS CARRY ### A bill to allow a person to carry a concealed handgun without getting a special permit failed to win approval in a Senate committee. The bill was backed by gun rights groups but opposed by state sheriffs. ### ___ ### MARIJUANA DECRIMINALIZATION ### The bill would have made possession of small amounts of marijuana punishable by a fine instead of jail time. An Alabama Senate committee advanced the bill, but it did not get final approval. ### ___ ### MEDICAL MARIJUANA ### The Senate approved a bill that would allow people with certain medical conditions to purchase medical marijuana with a doctor’s approval. However, the measure stalled in the House. ### ___ ### PAYDAY LOAN ### The proposal would extend the time that people have to repay a payday loan to 30 days. The proposal was designed to give borrowers more opportunity to raise the funds needed to repay a loan. ### ___ ### MANDATORY KINDERGARTEN ### The proposal would have required student to attend kindergarten before starting first grade. Most students do attend kindergarten, but it is not mandatory. ### ___ ### ETHICS OVERHAUL ### A Senate committee shelved a proposal that would have done away with a ban on gifts to public officials but replaced it with a requirement to report everything that was given. ### ___",060119,1,"_ __###PAY RAISES FOR TEACHERS, OTHERS###Teachers and other public school employees will receive a 4% pay raise.

48166,"May 31, 2019 at 4:21 pm ### | UPDATED: ### June 1, 2019 at 6:13 am ### Love stories can be tricky, even insidious things. When all the messaging around you is all about finding Mr. Right, you can start to feel like something isn’t right with you if your story doesn’t work out like that. ### That’s certainly the case for Jordan in the show “Significant Other” at San Francisco Playhouse. Written by Joshua Harmon (“Bad Jews” at Magic Theatre), the play premiered off-Broadway in 2015 and hit Broadway in 2017, and it’s now making its Bay Area premiere. ### Jordan is a 29-year-old gay man whose only friends, for whatever reason, are a trio of straight women. As those friends get boyfriends and get married in remarkably close succession, Jordan feels more and more alone. His friends are moving on and becoming couples, and he’s never had that and worries that he never will. At times the play feels like a riff on the themes of the musical “Company,” which SF Playhouse did a few years back. ### Laura (played by Ruibo Qian, left), Jordan (Kyle Cameron), and Vanessa (Nicole-Azalee Danielle) attend a wedding in “Significant Other.” (Jessica Palopoli/SF Playhouse) ### Kyle Cameron is often hilariously but also cripplingly anxious as Jordan. He’s in his element making snarky repartee with his friends, but whenever a cute guy is in the picture he gets borderline-stalker obsessive, with an undercurrent of self-loathing that keeps sabotaging any semblance of confidence he might be able to muster. ### Jacquelyn Scott’s set is curiously cold, its tall faux-marble walls like the lobby of a fancy business building, with little bits of scenery sliding in from the sides to suggest other locations. Maybe this setting is intended to accentuate Jordan’s sense of isolation, but it mostly makes it look like all the bachelorette parties, weddings and painting-gazing scenes in this play take place in a bank. ### Hayley Lovgren is amusingly blithe and devil-may-care as Kiki, the first to get married, projecting the kind of breezy confidence that makes it look like it’s never occurred to her to doubt anything. Nicole-Azalee Danielle is coolly blasé and cynical as Vanessa. Ruibo Qian exudes an easygoing, down-to-earth quality as Laura, Jordan’s closest friend; she seems easily like the most grounded character, in an unassuming, low-key way. ### As important as they may be to Jordan and his friends, the guys they meet and match up with are much less important, so they’re all played by a pair of actors in multiple roles. In fact, most of the friends’ new husbands are pretty clearly considered nonentities from the start. ### August Browning is brooding and unreadable as the hunky new guy in Jordan’s office who instantly becomes an object of obsession, and he’s almost insidiously nice as Laura’s new boyfriend. Greg Ayers is entertainingly obnoxious as a gossipy coworker and quietly amiable as a possibly feasible romantic prospect. ### Jordan (played by Kyle Cameron, right) shares a moment with his grandmother (Joy Carlin) in “Significant Other.” (Jessica Palopoli/SF Playhouse) ### Bay Area theater veteran Joy Carlin is sweetly placid as Jordan’s grandmother, a character so awkwardly and halfheartedly incorporated into the play that you start to worry after a while that something terrible is going to happen to justify her inclusion in the story. Not to worry, though — she’s just there as a narrative device to provide another, much needed perspective in Jordan’s increasing self-absorption. ### It’s a tricky thing to depict a personal crisis that mostly only seems like a crisis because of the protagonist’s youth and lack of perspective, despite a penchant for over-analyzing everything, and director Lauren English and the cast mostly pull it off without making Jordan seem too ridiculous. Or rather, he often does seem ridiculous, but in a ruefully funny and sympathetic way. ### A lot of that has to do with Harmon’s dialogue, packed with snappy dialogue and pithy philosophizing with just enough of a dash of inanity that it comes off as more funny than overly dramatic: “Being alive is so weird.” It’s a smart, bittersweet and unflinching look at how sometimes the happiness of loved ones somehow only fosters vicarious misery. ### Contact Sam Hurwitt at shurwitt@gmail.com, and follow him at Twitter.com/shurwitt. ### ‘SIGNIFICANT OTHER’ ### By Joshua Harmon, presented by San Francisco Playhouse ### Through: June 15 ### Where: San Francisco Playhouse, 450 Post St., San Francisco ### Running time: Two hours and 15 minutes, one intermission ### Tickets: $35-$125; 415-677-9596, www.sfplayhouse.org",060119,1,"It’s a tricky thing to depict a personal crisis that mostly only seems like a crisis because of the protagonist’s youth and lack of perspective, despite a penchant for over-analyzing everything, and director Lauren English and the cast mostly pull it off without making Jordan seem too ridiculous.

(Getty Images/iStockphoto/ Representative Image) ### A Florida man who posed as a Saudi royal for three decades and cheated people out of $8 million will spend 18 years in prison for fraud, authorities said Friday. ### Anthony Gignac, 48, constructed a personal world of luxury from his regal scam involving fake diplomatic credentials and a coterie of bodyguards. ### Posing as Khalid Bin Al-Saud, he lived in a condo on Miami’s posh Fisher Island, drove a Ferrari with a forged diplomatic license plate and eagerly courted investors and gift-givers. ### He was accompanied by bodyguards carrying fake diplomatic papers and demanded to be treated according to royal protocol, which he used to justify demands for gifts from potential investors. ### Dozens of people deposited money into his bank accounts, thinking Gignac, whose apartment bore a sign on its door reading “Sultan”, would invest it. ### Instead, he spent it on everything from designer clothes to yachts to private jet rides. ### Gignac moved to Miami in 2017 but Prince Khalid emerged long before then. ### Born in Colombia, Gignac was adopted by a family in Michigan at age seven, with his alter-ego first emerging ten years later when he was 17 years old. ### Since then, Gignac has been arrested and convicted several times for fraud, but that wasn’t enough to stop Prince Khalid. ### Amazingly, his years as a fraudster started to collapse like a house of cards around him when a real estate developer saw Gignac happily eating ham, bacon and other pork products that would normally be off-limits for a devout Muslim prince, according to the Miami Herald. ### In November 2017, he was arrested and charged with 18 counts, including electronic fraud and aggravated identity theft. ### “Over the course of the last three decades, Anthony Gignac has portrayed himself as a Saudi Prince in order to manipulate, victimize, and scam countless investors from around the world,” US Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan said in a statement. ### “As the leader of a sophisticated, multi-person, international fraud scheme, Gignac used his fake persona... to sell false hope,” she said. “Dozens of unsuspecting investors were stripped of their investments, losing more than $8 million.” ### Judge Cecilia Altonaga handed down the hefty sentence, saying Gignac’s life of luxury crime had been “really extraordinary.” ### (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Some people misunderstand their legal responsibilities when they receive these benefits, which can lead to a commission of fraud. By ### A Columbus manufacturer is closing a plant near the end of July that could leave nearly 100 workers without a job. ### Gildan Yarns, LLC, a division of the Montreal-based corporation Gildan, will close its plant at 3313 Fourth Ave. on July 28. Workers were notified about the closure Wednesday afternoon, said Garry Bell, Gildan’s Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Communications. ### The Fourth Avenue site produced yarn for athletic socks sold under the Gildan family of brands. The demand for those socks has decreased, resulting in the plant’s closure, according to company officials. ### “We’ve looked at a lot of options and what we could do with the facility,” Bell said. “There was no path forward.” ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to Ledger-Enquirer content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### A federally-required layoff/closure notice that Gildan filed with the Georgia Department of Labor stated that an estimated 97 employees would be affected. ### The company owns two facilities in Columbus — the Fourth Avenue site and another at 16 Corporate Ridge Parkway in east Columbus. Gildan also owns five other yarn-spinning facilities in the country— four in North Carolina and one in Cedartown, Georgia. ### Some workers at the Fourth Avenue location could get positions at the company’s other locations, but some will be let go, Bell said. ### “If they can’t move or new positions don’t open at the (other) facilities, then 97 people at the end of July would lose their job,” he said. ### The layoffs come more than a year after Gildan said it was adding 80 jobs in Columbus in response to increased demand for products that use the brand’s specialty yarns. ### Most of those new positions went to the Corporate Ridge Parkway location, which produces specialized yarn for t-shirts — a growing market for the company. About 30 Columbus employees had been moved from the Fourth Avenue site to the Corporate Ridge Parkway location to fill open positions and meet demand, Bell said. ### Gildan acquired Swift Spinning Mills in July 2017, according to the online site, eTextile Communications. Swift was a Columbus-based company that had been in operation since 1906. ### Gildan is a clothing manufacturer whose brands include Gildan, American Apparel, Comfort Colors and several others. The company’s U.S. yarn spinning operation employs about 1,500 and is the largest domestic consumer of American cotton, Bell said.",060119,1,"A federally-required layoff/closure notice that Gildan filed with the Georgia Department of Labor stated that an estimated 97 employees would be affected.###The company owns two facilities in Columbus — the Fourth Avenue site and another at 16 Corporate Ridge Parkway in east Columbus.

At the time of the filing, Sizmek said it will ""explore all available options, including a potential sale of our business."" ### Prior to its transaction with Amazon, Sizmek has already sold off its data and programmatic platforms DSP and DMP to marketing firm Zeta Global. In a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, Sizmek stressed that its creditors ""must sell the DSP on an urgent, expedited basis to avoid the complete collapse of the DSP going concern value."" ### Most recently, Sizmek confirmed on its website that it agreed to sell its two units to Amazon, adding that upon closing of the deal, the company will continue to operate separately from Amazon Advertising. ### Meanwhile, Amazon said it will continue serving the clients of Sizmek's two platforms when the transaction closes. ### Amazon, which now offers other technological solutions outside its legacy retail business, is up against Google in the battle for ad spending.  In 2018, Google recorded $32.64 billion in advertising revenues, up from $27.23 billion in 2017, while Amazon generated $10.11 billion from sales of advertising services and businesses related to other service offerings. ### This story may contain affiliate links. ### Don't miss these new Advertising News Reports ### Loading...",060119,1,"Photo Credit: Tobias Dziuba from Pexels###The deal is expected to boost the e-commerce giant's ad offerings as it battles with Google in attracting ad spending.###Amazon is acquiring two ad-serving technologies from bankrupt advertising firm Sizmek for an undisclosed amount.###In a brief statement May 31, the U.S. e-commerce giant said it entered into a definitive agreement to buy Sizmek Ad Server and Sizmek Dynamic Creative Optimization, confirming earlier reports about the deal.###Sizmek DCO allows clients to create ads that are targeted to specific audiences, while the Ad Server offers a range of advertising solutions, such as ad serving and creative authoring.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]","<p>Photo Credit: Tobias Dziuba from Pexels</p><p>The deal is expected to boost the e-commerce giant's ad offerings as it battles with Google in attracting ad spending.</p><p>Amazon is acquiring two ad-serving technologies from bankrupt advertising firm Sizmek for an undisclosed amount.</p><p>In a brief statement May 31, the U.S. e-commerce giant said it entered into a definitive agreement to buy Sizmek Ad Server and Sizmek Dynamic Creative Optimization, confirming earlier reports about the deal.</p><p>Sizmek DCO allows clients to create ads that are targeted to specific audiences, while the Ad Server offers a range of advertising solutions, such as ad serving and creative authoring.</p>"

34535,"Police searching for missing Houston girl Maleah Davis say body of child found in Arkansas ### By Juan A. Lozano ### May 31, 2019 | 9:49 PM ### | HOUSTON ### This undated file photo released by the Houston Police Department shows 4-year-old Maleah Davis. (Houston Police Department via AP) ### The remains of a child were found Friday near a freeway in Arkansas where a community activist says a man told him he had dumped the body of a missing 4-year-old Houston girl, police said Friday. ### Houston police went to Arkansas on Friday after community activist Quanell X told authorities the man arrested in connection with the disappearance of Maleah Davis confessed he disposed of her body there just before he reported her missing in early May. ### Advertisement ### Houston Police Commander Michael Skillern, one of the officers who traveled to Arkansas, told reporters that authorities had found a child's remains in a garbage bag near Interstate 30 close to Hope. ### Quanell X said he spoke on Friday in jail with Derion Vence, the ex-fiance of Maleah's mother, who had claimed Maleah was abducted. Quanell X said that Vence told him he dumped her body in Arkansas. ### Sheriff James Singleton in Arkansas' Hempstead County said workers found the bag, which had a foul odor coming from it, near Hope, about 30 miles northeast of the Texas-Arkansas border. ### Singleton said the medical examiner's office in Little Rock likely will have to identify the remains. ### ""If this is the little girl, we want to make sure that we treat it with respect and dignity,"" Singleton said. ### At a news conference in Houston, Executive Assistant Police Chief Troy Finner said authorities won't be able to confirm if the remains are those of Maleah until an autopsy is performed. ### It was unclear how long the identification process would take, Finner said. ### By Lindsay Whitehurst ### May 30, 2019 | 9:06 AM ### ""Do we believe that it's possibly her? Yes. But can we confirm it right now? No,"" Finner said. ### Finner said Maleah's family had been notified of Friday's developments in the case and he expects a murder charge will be filed in the case. ### ""We are here to make sure that little angel receives some justice and whoever is responsible we are going to hold them accountable,"" he said. ### Advertisement ### Vence, 27, had claimed he, Maleah and his 2-year-old son were abducted on May 4 by a group of men in a truck. He said he and his son were freed the next day but the kidnappers kept Maleah and his silver Nissan Altima.

But, it said it suspended the funding after discovering recent tweets that violated those terms and would not resume it until the contractor responsible for the account ensures that all future activity meets the guidelines. ### The identity of the person or group contracted to run the account or how much money it had received was not immediately clear. ### When its funding was suspended, the year-old account, which says it was created with the goal of ""exposing and countering disinformation from the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" had only a modest audience with fewer than 2,000 followers. At least some of those followers are fierce opponents of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal from which President Donald Trump withdrew last year. ### × ### Already a subscriber? Log in or Activate your account . ### Loading&hellp; ### {{featured_button_text}} ### The funding suspension was announced Friday after several people targeted by @IranDisinfo pointed out what they called harassment by a U.S. government-linked account. They suggested they were being targeted for criticizing or questioning the Trump administration's hardline stance on Iran. ### Among those criticized by the tweets, which have now been deleted, were a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a Washington Post columnist, a BBC journalist and a professor at Georgetown University, according to Negar Mortazavi, an Iranian-American commentator who was also targeted. ### Subscribe to Breaking News ### Sign up!  ### Mortazavi published a lengthy series of tweets with screenshots of the offending @IranDisinfo posts on Thursday. ### The project is funded by the State Department's Global Engagement Center, which was created by Congress to run online efforts to combat extremism.

3632,"The AFL ain't broke, so why do they keep trying to fix it? ### The AFL ain't broke, so why do they keep trying to fix it? ### By Sam Duncan ### Very large text size ### It seems Australian sports just can’t shake their cultural cringe. ### At a meeting of the AFL’s competition committee last week, the American-inspired wildcard round was back on the agenda. Apparently it received ""general support"" from those in the room. ### Melbourne would have benefited from a wildcard round in 2017. ### Credit:AAP ### The proposal would see 7th play 10th and 8th play 9th at the end of the 23 round AFL season, with the two winners securing the final two prized positions in the top 8 and play finals. ### Of course, various forms of the wildcard round have been adopted by many US and overseas-based competitions for some years, including Major League Baseball and American football’s NFL, to add another layer of razzmatazz and excitement to the pointy end of their seasons. ### Advertisement ### Loading ### From an AFL perspective, the rationale is simple. It’s a matter of money. The wildcard weekend will create two extra matches with a lot at stake for the competing teams. Depending on who plays, the matches could attract huge crowds and millions of extra television viewers, ultimately making the AFL product all the more valuable. ### However, beyond the actual two extra matches, it will also serve to make more games in the later stages of the long home and away season more interesting. Teams towards the bottom of the ladder will remain in contention to finish 10th and therefore make the finals, making their games more meaningful. ### Currently, those games are dead rubbers with dwindling crowds, lower television ratings and limited commercial appeal. Football is built on hope and while fans still have hope, they’ll walk across broken glass to watch their team play. ### So the wildcard round is a money-grab designed to excite consumers to keep them interested for longer. And given how hard it’s becoming to make a buck in a crowded sports market, maybe this sort of American-inspired gimmick actually serves a greater good. ### Yet no matter how many different ways you look at it, the idea smacks of Australia’s famous cultural cringe rearing its ugly head again. ### It seems we’re forever peering abroad, particularly to America, wondering what they’re doing and, disturbingly, constantly assuming they’re doing it better than we are. ### It’s this inferiority complex that drives proud Australians, of all sports, crazy. Former Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou detests it, claiming it has corrupted soccer in Australia. ### He writes in his book Changing the Game that, “The subconscious attitude even among some football people is of inferiority; that whatever happens here is somehow second rate, held with a ‘that’s not how they do it in Europe’ sort of sneer.” ### He goes on to state, “The self-loathing has reached such intensity that the sport lashes itself to within an inch of its life, its raw flesh dangling and dripping.” ### It’s also this kind of inferiority complex that so often leads to self-conscious AFL fans gushing over overseas innovations and calling for our game to adopt ideas such as making player salaries public, introducing ""Super Bowl like"" grand final entertainment, insisting on mid-season trade periods and implementing wildcard weekends. ### Apparently, it’s ""immature"" not to embrace such worldly and widely accepted conventions. But why? ### Perhaps it comes from an underlying, angst-ridden perception that our game is quaint, reduced to just one small corner of the world. My English mate Graham is often surprised by the rabid support Melburnians have for their favourite AFL teams given they can never compete against teams from around the world. For him, pure joy comes from being crowned the best in the world. ### But this ought not be a surprise. After all, it’s the game we love, regardless of who it’s played by, not the idea of being world champions. And so we wonder just how many overseas gimmicks we need to adopt before we’re allowed to feel good about ourselves, and proud of our game. ### I think we’ve got it all wrong. For as much as we convince ourselves that we need to run to keep up with the rest of world, we might end up being the poorer for it. After all, as the saying goes, there’s no point trying to be something we’re not. ### Sam Duncan is a regular columnist and a lecturer in sports media and marketing.",060119,1,"It seems Australian sports just can’t shake their cultural cringe.###At a meeting of the AFL’s competition committee last week, the American-inspired wildcard round was back on the agenda.

4958,"Riddle of agency’s Sh800m ‘sub-standard’ power poles ### Nzau Musau 01st Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT +0300 ### A Kenya Power personnel at work along Kiambu Kirigiti road on February 2 ,2015. [File, Standard] ### The battle to stop a state agency from disposing Sh800 million worth of electricity poles has spilled over to the courts and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI). ### What started as a mere complaint from one supplier - Inter Tropical Timber Ltd- to Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter, has since morphed into a court order by Justice J A Makau stopping Rural Electrification Authority (REA) from interfering with the 51,238 substandard poles. ### And now, the law firm of Kinyua Njagi & Company Advocates has written to DCI alerting them of the preservation orders granted by the courts and seeking an update on an earlier complaint in March on the same matter. ### “Kindly note the court issued the orders for the preservation of the substandard poles as the same are exhibits which your office needs to urgently examine and scrutinise to guide the court on the criminal culpability of the respondents,” the lawyer’s letter dated May 16 to DCI says. ### Collusion ### Before Justice Makau issued the orders on May 8, the petitioner told the court that REA, now renamed Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC), was returning the poles to their suppliers despite an ongoing investigation as to how they were accepted in the first place. The petitioner alleges collusion of top REREC officials and suppliers in approval of substandard poles before he disapproved them in tests. Besides, he argues that firms which supplied the poles ought to return the public monies paid to them before collecting them. ### “It is hereby ordered that pending hearing and determination of the application interpartes, a conservatory order be and is hereby issued suspending the first respondent decision to return 51,238 substandard treated power transmission wooden poles currently held at Makuyu, Mariakani and Kisumu-Awasi,” Justice Makau ordered. In February, Inter Tropical wrote to Kenya Bureau of Standard (Kebs) complaining that the life-span of power poles had suddenly dropped from 30-40 years to less than 5 years. The complaint caught the eye of Energy Principal Secretary Joseph Njoroge and the CS who ordered a probe to ascertain the claims. ### “Please take note of the contents of the subject letter and revert with the comments on the issues raised therein for further necessary action,” PS Njoroge wrote on February 28. ### A few days earlier, Mr Keter had, in a handwritten note asked REA to “confirm and urgently get me a quick response and if true those involved must face the law.” ### A report by REA for the CS on the claims and dated March 5, lifted the lid on the operations of REA with regard to acceptance or rejection of poles on the basis of treatment. For instance, of all the 7,649 ten metre poles received in Mariakani’s REA stores since July 1, 2018, none had been rejected. ### “Poles that do not meet the minimum requirements are rejected and set aside for the affected suppliers to collect within fifteen days. The suppliers whose poles fail the inspection are immediately notified of the inspection outcome,” Mbugua said in the report sent to CS, PS and the complainant. ### But Inter Tropical claimed REA stores were infiltrated by quacks cum inspectors not accredited and who care less about specifications, safety and standards. REA gave in to the idea of external quality inspection by Kebs or “any other authorised body to conduct tests” on the poles in their stores. It is this acceptance of external inspection that has landed the matter to court whose hearing has been fixed for June 19. The first inspection done only at Makuyu store and to the exclusion of Kebs and Kenya Power was rejected by the petition as biased. ### Reject biased report ### “The petitioner did reject the biased report and sought the involvement of KP and Kebs in the re-inspection in all the stores which report by KP and countersigned by the 1st respondent inspection and acceptance officials confirmed that all the poles were substandard/rejects having failed the minimum retention of 20kg/m3,” an affidavit tabled in court states. REA on Monday moved to court seeking to lift the conservatory orders, saying the petitioner concealed important facts including that they could return substandard poles for re-treatment and re-supply under the terms of the contract. ### Through lawyer Dennis Mosota, the State agency said the conservatory order has affected the rural electrification program and the realisation of the government’s last mile connectivity programme. In an affidavit sworn by Legal Affairs Manager Sharon Tugee, REA said the order was obtained in bad faith. On Tuesday, Justice Makau certified REA’s concerns as urgent and set mention on June 4. ### Register to advertise your products & services on our classifieds website Digger.co.ke and enjoy one month subscription free of charge and 3 free ads on the Standard newspaper. ### Related Topics",060119,1,"Riddle of agency ’s Sh800m ‘sub-standard’ power poles###Nzau Musau 01st Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT +0300###A Kenya Power personnel at work along Kiambu Kirigiti road on February 2 ,2015.

He said Mr Makhlouf has not offered his resignation. ### As a chief executive within the civil service Mr Makhlouf is accountable to government ministers. However, the state services commissioner is responsible for issues of job performance. ### State Services has already called an inquiry into the data breach at Treasury. Although its exact terms of reference have not yet been set, the department said its purpose is to consider only Treasury’s information security; Mr Makhlouf’s conduct is a separate matter. ### Leak ### New Zealand’s opposition National Party is demanding Mr Makhlouf resign following Treasury’s unwitting leak of budget details ahead of the official release date last week. ### Last Tuesday, Mr Makhlouf said Treasury had been hacked. Deputy prime minister Winston Peters accused the opposition National Party – which published the embargoed information – of using material that was illegally acquired. On Thursday, police confirmed that nothing illegal had taken place and said Treasury’s own website search tool was used to access budget information. ### Incoming Irish Central Bank chief caught up in New Zealand controversy ### National leader, Simon Bridges, said Treasury was “sitting on a lie” after saying it was hacked on Tuesday. He said Mr Maklouf “either knew or ought to have known” the information was legally obtained. ### Mr Makhlouf’s conduct, rather than the actual leak, raises the most concern, according to Jordan Williams, executive director of the Taxpayers’ Union. “The cover-up is worse than the cock-up,” Mr Williams said. “It is clear he [Mr Makhlouf] misled New Zealanders...he must resign.” ### Dr Bryce Edwards, political scientist at Victoria University Wellington, said the situation is “very serious,” for Mr Makhlouf. “There’s a problem of deception and with Makhlouf more than anyone else. It’s not going to be fixed by an apology.” ### The inquiry called by State Services is expected to run over a period of months. The department has not yet appointed someone to lead it. ### ‘Trust and confidence’ ### “This is an important issue because it goes to the trust and confidence in the public service and in the security of government information,” Mr Hughes said. ### Mr Robertson said Mr Makhlouf apologised to him for the data breach. ### Mr Makhlouf is slated to leave his job at Treasury on June 27th and take up his position at the Central Bank of Ireland on September 1st. He will succeed Philip Lane, who is moving to a post with the European Central Bank next month. ### A spokeswoman for the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said the controversy would not affect Mr Makhlouf’s appointment as governor of the Central Bank. ### Mr Makhlouf has been the subject of opposition criticism in New Zealand already this year. In February, his department revealed it had placed a dollar value on facets of social wellbeing including friendship and good neighbours. National called the effort irrelevant. ### The calculations underpinned last week’s so-called Wellbeing Budget which aimed to move beyond GDP and financial indicators to gauge national progress. ### However, the budget details released on Thursday were largely eclipsed by the furore, first over allegations of hacking, and later over the acknowledged lapse of security at Treasury and allegations of a cover-up.",060119,1,"Mr Makhlouf’s conduct, rather than the actual leak, raises the most concern, according to Jordan Williams, executive director of the Taxpayers’ Union. “ The cover-up is worse than the cock-up,” Mr Williams said. “ It is clear he [Mr Makhlouf] misled New Zealanders... he must resign. ”###Dr Bryce Edwards, political scientist at Victoria University Wellington, said the situation is “very serious,” for Mr Makhlouf. “ There’s a problem of deception and with Makhlouf more than anyone else.

79020,"PLAY YELLOW! Spectators asked to wear yellow to Memorial Tournament Sunday for children's hospitals ### By: ### Posted: May 31, 2019 04:16 PM EDT ### Updated: May 31, 2019 04:16 PM EDT ### DUBLIN, OH (WCMH) -- To say Jack and Barbara Nicklaus have a passion for helping children would be an understatement. One of the best Children's Miracle Network hospitals in the country is named for the couple--Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami—and the couple has raised millions of dollars for CMN, which includes Columbus' Nationwide Children's Hospital. Their new goal is to help raise $100 million over the next five years for the kids through the Play Yellow campaign. ### ""Jack and I are so excited about the Play Yellow campaign. We announced it at the TPC Championship this year. Partnering our foundation, Children's Miracle Network, and the PGA Tour on a Play Yellow campaign-- it's very personal for Jack and me, and we're really thrilled about it."" ### The campaign will be on full display at the Memorial Tournament Sunday. They want to see a ""yellow out"" at Muirfield. ### ""It's a very personal thing. We're just so thrilled. And hopefully we're having Sunday Day on Play Yellow Day on Sunday. I hope I'll see a lot of yellow out here on Sunday and raise lots of money for Children's Miracle Network,"" said Mrs. Nicklaus. ### Jack is famous for wearing yellow on Sundays, but for a long time the reason why was a mystery. It's in honor of family friend Craig Smith who was battling a rare bone cancer. Craig passed way in 1971. ### ""Jack probably called him once a week for the next two years until we lost Craig at age 13. One call Jack made was a Sunday night after he had won a tournament, and Craig said to him ‘Jack, you know why you won?' and Jack said, ‘well, what are you talking about?'

This will widen its common equity tier 1—a key indicator of a bank’s financial strength. The fresh funds will allow PNB “to sustain its asset growth.” ### According to the filing, the rights offer will run from June 26 to July 5 this year. The offer price and entitlement ratios have yet to be determined, PNB added. ### FEATURED STORIES ### SEC makes permanent cease-and-desist order vs KAPA ### The bank’s consolidated risk-based capital adequacy ratio (CAR) exceeds the minimum regulatory requirement of 10 percent to date.

27247,"It's Time to Get Greedy With These Growth Stocks ### Even as these companies face challenges, they represent compelling bargains near their recent lows. ### Danny Vena ### ( TMFLifeIsGood ) ### Jun 1, 2019 at 12:33PM ### Investors looking to succeed in investing have no better example than legendary Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE:BRK-A ) ( NYSE:BRK-B ) CEO Warren Buffett. Since 1965, his company has generated compounded annual gains of more than 20%, increasing by the end of 2018 a whopping 2,472,627%. ### One particularly useful piece of advice from the Oracle of Omaha is this gem: ### I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful. ### Every company goes though rough patches, leaving investors fearing for the worst, when perhaps they should be seeing an opportunity to get greedy. With that in mind, let's look at three growth companies facing short-term challenges that might represent compelling opportunities: NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Activision Blizzard ( NASDAQ:ATVI ), and IPG Photonics ( NASDAQ:IPGP ). ### Image source: Getty Images. ### A chip off the old block ### NVIDIA had been riding high, experiencing a trifecta of growth catalysts: strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) from gamers, increasing adoption for data centers and artificial intelligence, and significant demand generated by those mining cryptocurrency -- all contributing to the stock's multi-year run. The bottom dropped out late last year when growth in two of sources seemed to dry up. The cryptocurrency bubble burst, reducing demand for GPUs and leaving excess inventory in the channel. Then, weaker demand from its booming data center segment caused a year-over-year decline of 10% -- after years of double- and even triple-digit gains in the segment. ### This one-two punch caused revenue to fall 31% and 24% year over year, respectively, in the two most recent quarters. This dismal performance sent investors running for the exit, and the stock shed more than half its value. ### All is not lost, however. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said on a recent conference call , ""The entire reason for [the] Q4 and Q1 [shortfall] is attributed to oversupply in the channel as a result of cryptocurrency."" Once this excess inventory is cleared out, the company expects GPU sales to return to ""normal levels for gaming."" NVIDIA also addressed the ""pause"" in data center spending, explaining that hyperscale customers bought excess supply last year. The company expects the situation to persist into the second quarter but expects the second half to be ""sizably larger"" than the first, with the data center segment returning to growth. ### In all, these challenges should be short-lived, and NVIDIA stock should soon resume its upward trajectory. ### Image source: Getty Images. ### Play the game ### Activision Blizzard was on the heels of a multiyear sprint, with the stock price quadrupling since 2015. Suddenly, the company was in freefall, over fears that free-to-play battle royale titles like Epic Games' Fortnite were eating into its results. Revenue fell by 7% year over year during the third quarter of 2018. Even worse than the disappointing sales were the three consecutive quarters of falling monthly active users -- a metric that helps measure engagement -- which declined about 12% during the same period. ### It's worth noting that the engagement and revenue difficulties began just about the same time Fortnite Battle Royale was released in September 2017. ### Activision Blizzard isn't taking the news sitting down. On a conference call early this year, the company announced a massive restructuring of its development efforts, increasing the number of developers assigned to key franchises. This will result in a more consistent flow of content including up-front releases, in-game content, and mobile and geographic expansion, as well as eliminating investment in disappointing titles. ### These efforts are beginning to bear fruit. While revenue declined 7% year over year in the most recent quarter and earnings fell 11%, both top- and bottom-line metrics exceeded management's guidance from three months ago. ### Activision just got some love from analysts , citing increased investment in core games, further expansion into mobile gaming, and new content for under-monetized titles as catalysts that are expected to drive the stock higher. ### Image source: Getty Images. ### Big trouble in Greater China ### IPG Photonics was achieving all-time highs early last year, before the trade war took its toll. The laser maker was hit by softer demand in China and Europe that were ""driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors rather than competitive dynamics,"" causing the stock to lose more than half its value from recent highs. ### The saber-rattling continues between Beijing and Washington, D.C., but things are beginning to look up. Even though revenue fell 12% year over year, IPG CEO Dr. Valentin Gapontsev noted that during the quarter, ""business trends improved in China driving sequential growth in orders."" The company also took the situation as an opportunity to substantially reduce component and manufacturing costs, which will benefit not only the current quarter, but also many more in the future. ### The current political climate won't go on forever. China is one of IPG's biggest markets, and once the trade war runs its course, it will once again be business as usual for the laser pioneer. ### The inevitable disclaimer ### While these are solid companies facing temporary setbacks, there are no guarantees things will turn around any time soon. That said, the time to be greedy is when others are being fearful, and initiating positions in these companies or adding to them now look like pretty solid bets for investors with a long investing horizon. ### Author",060119,1,"Image source: Getty Images.###A chip off the old block###NVIDIA had been riding high, experiencing a trifecta of growth catalysts: strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) from gamers, increasing adoption for data centers and artificial intelligence, and significant demand generated by those mining cryptocurrency -- all contributing to the stock's multi-year run.

LOUIS - Matt Carpenter knew exactly what he needed to do. ### Carpenter hit a game-ending single against an unusual defensive alignment in the 10th inning, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs 2-1 on Friday night. ### ""They had their entire 25-man roster on the right side of the field,"" Carpenter said, ""so I just knew that hitting pull side on the ground — pull side in the air, that's fine, we could still score — pull side on the ground was not an option. ### ""So my approach in that at-bat was to look for something to hit the other way and get something in the air and was able to do it."" ### The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage for May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). They went 8-18 in May 1980. ### ""A lot of guys in here that are not performing like they wish they would, myself included,"" Carpenter said. ""I have a feeling we're all going to get going at the same time. Hopefully, tonight was the start of that."" ### Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. ### Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter, and put four players on the right side of the infield. But Carpenter drove in Wong with a fly ball that found the grass in the left field corner. ### ""You're in a tough spot there, on the other side, of what you want to defend,"" Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said. ""Clearly, it's bases loaded. Winning run at third with one out. (Carpenter) had a good approach, didn't try to do too much, which I appreciated."" ### Maddon said Maples clearly struck out Bader on a pitch that umpire Laz Díaz ruled was ball four, and the missed call changed the complexion of the entire inning. ### ""It wasn't even a borderline pitch; it was a strike,"" Maddon said. ""That's the kind of stuff you want to see something done about and I'm still not advocating an electronic strike zone, I'm just advocating let's go, let's go. You cannot miss that pitch in that situation."" ### Cardinals right-hander Miles Mikolas gave up one run in seven innings. He allowed six hits and walked two while throwing 104 pitches, matching his season high. ### Carlos Martínez pitched a perfect eighth for St. Louis, and Jordan Hicks (2-2) worked two scoreless innings. The last pitch Hicks threw in the ninth registered at 104.3 mph, which is the fastest in baseball this season. ### Cubs starter Yu Darvish permitted three hits through six innings, but still picked up his sixth straight no-decision. He walked his first two batters, leading to Marcell Ozuna's sacrifice fly. ### ""That was some really electric stuff by him all night long,"" Maddon said. ""His confidence is beginning to soar and I believe you're going to see that a lot more often."" ### Chicago had a chance to break the tie after Jason Heyward and Addison Russell led off the fourth with singles, but Mikolas got Albert Almora Jr. to ground into a double play to end the threat. ### ""I was kind of the middle of the zone and worked around that,"" Mikolas said. ""Made some frustrating two strike pitches early in the game, cleaned it up a little bit as the game went on and found a groove there towards the later innings."" ### STILL STREAKING ### Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo singled in the first to extend his hitting streak to 12 games, two shy of his career-high streak in June 2017. ### TRAINING ROOM ### Cubs: RHP Pedro Strop (left hamstring strain) could be activated as soon as Saturday, but Maddon said the team is still discussing the next move. ### Cardinals: C Yadier Molina (strained right thumb tendon) was placed on the 10-day injured list. ""It's just a slight little tear between the thumb and the webbing, his right finger rather,"" Shildt said. ### UP NEXT ### Left-hander José Quintana (4-4, 3.73 ERA) takes the mound for the Cubs on Saturday night against right-hander Jack Flaherty (4-3, 3.77 ERA).

58995,"Trump tariffs on Mexico would likely mean Americans paying more for cars, avocados ### Share: ### ABCNews ### By SOPHIE TATUM ### From cars to avocados, the biggest hit from President Donald Trump 's threatened tariffs on imports from Mexico would likely be on American consumers' wallets. ### The tariffs are expected to start at 5% beginning June 10 and could end up going as high as 25% by October, according to the White House. ### ""These tariffs, unlike previous tariffs that we've seen, where they're targeted maybe at particular imports, these are broad based,"" said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president for the pro-business U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ### ""It's everything that the United States imports from Mexico and so, in that respect, the harm both to businesses and consumers is going to be really broad based. And as they escalate, significant,"" he said. ### The administration on Thursday announced sweeping tariffs in what Trump described as an effort to force Mexico to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking across its border with the U.S. Instead, Bradley said, the tariffs will raise the price of various everyday items for U.S. consumers. ### ""The White House is right, there's a real problem at the southern border. Unfortunately, tariffs won't do anything to solve that problem and what we don't want to do is see self-inflicted pain on American families and our economy when that pain won't do anything to solve that very real problem,"" Bradley said. ### Bradley confirmed that the Chamber was ""exploring"" all of its options in response to the administration's announcement, including potential legal action and what could be done legislatively. ### Senior research fellow Sherman Robinson at the Peterson Institute for International Economics said there will be many products that could see price increases. ### ""In terms of where they hit, the first one everybody understands is guacamole's going to be more expensive,"" Robinson said. ### Some other goods that Robinson noted that could be affected include beer, parts for air conditioners and refrigerators, and medical, surgical and dental instruments. ### But the industry that will most likely see the biggest effect, Robinson said, is the auto industry, calling the North American auto industry ""incredibly integrated."" ### ""The really big one will be the motor vehicle industry in North America,"" Robinson said. ""That's probably the largest single traded good across North America."" ### He later added: ""Having us withdraw from global trade is not going to help automobile workers, it's going to just damage the automobile industry."" ### Senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities Mark Vitnern said he estimated that ""car and light truck prices would rise 4% to 6% if tariffs were increased to 25% and remained there for several months."" ### ""Imports of Mexican-made vehicles account for around 15% of U.S. sales. Prices for other vehicles - made in the US and elsewhere - would also rise,"" he said in an email.",060119,1,""" It's everything that the United States imports from Mexico and so, in that respect, the harm both to businesses and consumers is going to be really broad based.

Both of those causes are extremely crucial to our future, so I really find it important to invest time into supporting them."" ### Cara also says laughter is one of the best ways to stay positive and she gets her daily fix from watching hilarious viral videos via her Instagram account. ### When asked what makes her laugh, she said: ""Viral videos on Instagram. Sometimes the viral videos make me laugh so hard I cry."" ### Cara previously admitted she thinks it's ""important"" to talk about ""mental illness"" and she included the subject in her young adult novel 'Mirror, Mirror', in a bid to make young people realize they're not alone if they're suffering from any condition. ### She previously said: ""I think it's really important that in this book, and generally, that mental illness is talked about. I think my depression came from a mixture of things, whether it was from pressure from, not only myself, but ... to do well in school, from my parents to get good grades, and to be someone I thought I was that I wasn't. ### ""You bottle so much up, you end up going mad. When you bottle emotions up that's when it leads to [your] downfall."" ### This article originally ran on celebretainment.com .",060119,1,Thank you for Reading!

For men, life expectancy is 76.3 years; for women, it’s 81.2 years. The Kaiser Family Foundation points out that nearly 71 percent of men are at risk of being overweight or obese, compared to 59 percent for women. Far more women than men are likely to go to a physician office visit, according to the Centers for Disease Control. ### These statistics may be worrisome for men and their loved ones, but many of the health risks men face can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle and getting recommended and timely preventive health screenings. ### “It’s important for men to take charge of their health,” said Dr. Chad E. Bittner, a chief medical officer of OptumCare. ""And there are a number of things men can do to get and stay healthy."" ### Bittner offers the following tips to help men improve their health and well-being: ### Physical activity: Regardless of gender, Bittner said he gives people the same general health advice, although men often need more reminders. One focus area for patients is physical activity. Regular physical activity can control weight, reduce risks of developing heart disease and some cancers, and can improve overall mental health and mood. ### Nutrition: Another important priority is nutrition. Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables every day, and limit foods and drinks high in sugar, salt, saturated fat and alcohol. ### He points out other important reminders for men: ### Sunscreen: Don’t overlook the importance of using sunscreen. Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in the United States. ### Prescriptions: All patients need to work with their doctors to get a full understanding of the purpose and side effects of the prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs and supplements they take. ### Depression: It’s important for men and those close to them to be aware of the warning signs for depression. ### If you or the men in your life are not making positive health choices, now is the perfect time to take charge of your health. ### More information is available at optumcare.com/menshealth .",060119,1,"Updated: June 1, 2019 @ 9:59 pm###Men’s Health Month in June: A time to take action###Brandpoint (BPT)###Save###(BPT) - The statistics for men’s health are alarming.

Photo Credit: AP/Petr David Josek ### By Colin Stephenson colin.stephenson@newsday.com @ColinASteph ### Updated June 1, 2019 6:02 PM ### fbShare Tweet Email ### Whoever the Rangers end up taking with the No. 2 pick overall in this month’s NHL Draft, whether it is Kaapo Kakko or Jack Hughes, that player will give the Blueshirts’ talent level a turbo boost. ### But could that pick end up proving to be the turning point in the Rangers’ rebuild? Could adding Kakko or Hughes propel the Rangers out of the rebuild and into playoff contention as early as next season? ### “I don’t put a timetable on it,’’ Rangers assistant general manager Chris Drury said when asked that question. “It was extremely exciting to move up and get this pick. We’re getting a very high-quality player, and we’re just kind of taking it one step at a time, and keep trying to get as many good players as we can and develop them as best we can to be full-time, productive, great Rangers. So, that’s how we look at it.’’ ### Drury wouldn’t say that it was a given to expect the No. 2 pick to make the Rangers’ roster out of training camp. “I think you never know,’’ he said. ### But given that Kakko played as a 17-year-old in Finland’s top professional league and set a record for goals in that league (22, in 45 games), and given the way Hughes dominated for a loaded U.S. National Team Development Program side, either would be a good bet to make the club for opening night. ### The Rangers, with new team president John Davidson taking over for the retiring Glen Sather, could be poised to make a huge jump from their 78-point campaign in 2018-19. Vitali Kravtsov, the first of their three first-round picks last year, is already spending the summer in North America, skating and working out to get ready for training camp. Kravtsov, 19, had eight goals, 13 assists and 21 points in 50 games for Traktor Chelyabinsk in the KHL, leading all players younger than 20 in all three categories. He’ll need to adjust to the smaller North American rinks, but if he makes the team, and if Davidson and GM Jeff Gorton can add a free agent like Artemi Panarin, that could give a boost to the offense. Add Kakko or Hughes, and the offense could be much improved. ### The defense could be better with the addition of Jericho native Adam Fox, who was acquired last month in a trade with the Carolina Hurricanes. Second-year pros Libor Hajek and Ryan Lindgren will challenge seriously for a spot on the Blueshirts defense, and the Rangers could look to bring in a free agent defenseman. Goaltender Igor Shesterkin and defenseman Yegor Rykov are also coming over from Russia. ### The Rangers also have a total of nine picks in the draft — including two first-rounders and two second-rounders — and those picks could be chips they could use to make trades for NHL-ready players.

44012,"Clear skies. Low 62F. Winds light and variable.. ### Tonight ### Clear skies. Low 62F. Winds light and variable. ### Updated: June 1, 2019 @ 10:09 pm ### 0602 Fishing Report ### Save ### Lake Greenwood ### Lake Greenwood water levels are at 438.96 (full pool is 440.0) and surface water temperatures are in the lower 70s. The whole lake is fishable, with the lower end clear and the upper end only mildly stained. ### With a SC Bass Federation tournament upcoming on Lake Greenwood there is only so much information that can be given out, but veteran tournament angler Stan Gunter of Saluda reports that the majority of the fish seem to be shallow while a few are just starting to go deep to brush. The topwater bite early around sea walls has been pretty good, and there has also been good action around bream beds during the day. During the day you can also fish docks, where both Senkos and jigs will catch fish. ### Lake Russell ### Lake Russell water levels are above full pool at 475.26 (full pool is 475.00), and water temperatures are in the mid-70s. Most of the lake is clear with only a mild stain in some creeks. ### The bass fishing is good on Lake Russell, and Guide Jerry Kotal (706-988-0860) reports that the fish he is catching are related to both points and pockets. While the bass spawn is basically over the herring are spawning periodically, and throwing to points in 5-6 feet of water you can catch fish on topwaters or worms. You can also fish a floating worm or buzzbaits around the banks in pockets. ### It seems to Guide Wendell Wilson (706-283-3336) that we are about in the middle of the herring spawn, and perhaps because of that he says that the shallow spotted bass fishing is wide open. Both males and females are around the bank on the main lake about as shallow as they ever come, and going down the bank and throwing a Gulp! swimming mullet on a 1/8-ounce jighead into 4-6 feet of water has been a really good pattern. Even though it’s thought of as a saltwater bait the spots have been tearing it up. ### Early in the morning Wendell is also finding a very good bite for largemouth off shallow points with topwaters. ### The striped bass and hybrids are also feeding around the banks and off points, and they will take the same swimbaits as well as free-lined live herring. However, Wendell reports that they have mainly been catching smaller fish up to about 5 pounds. ### Crappie fishing has been good, and they are ganged up on shallow brush in 10-15 feet of water in the creeks. Wendell’s boat is fishing about halfway down the water column with minnows and jigs both working about the same. ### It’s getting to be a really good time for catfish on Lake Russell, and Jerry suggests going into the backs of coves and pockets and fishing cut herring on the bottom. Aim for about 8-10 feet of water. It will not be very long before the fish are spawning. ### Lake Thurmond ### Lake Thurmond water levels are at 328.24 (full pool is 330.00) and water temperatures are in the mid to upper-70s. ### The bass bite has changed a little on Lake Thurmond, but tournament angler Josh Rockefeller of Augusta reports that overall the action is still really good fishing for bass that are targeting spawning blueback herring. Fish are still all over the points in 1-3 feet of water, but Josh has discovered that in addition to the Gunfish he is having to throw swimbaits and swimming flukes on a ¼ ounce jighead. There are still some good fish being caught on topwaters, but overall fish are getting a little more finesse-oriented at this stage of the herring spawn. ### Striped bass and hybrids are also focused on the spawning herring, and William Sasser Guide Service (706-589-5468) reports that in the lower lake they are still pushed up very shallow on points around daylight. A lot of people are fishing free lines and planer boards, but it is also possible to catch them on very shallow down lines. Captain Brad Sasser has found fish in the 6-feet and 18-feet range around daylight along the edges of the channel, but after the sun gets up, they scatter out in the same areas and it is hard to find a concentration of fish. Free-lines and planer boards with weights are working, and there is no big group of fish in 20 or 30 feet of water. Fish seem to be making their way towards the lower end of the lake. ### In the mid-lake, Captain Chris Simpson (864-992-2352) reports that the planer board bite is tapering off but fish are still catchable. The down-line bite is getting better by the day and will soon be easily the best way to generate fast action. The most productive depths in the mid-lake for down-lining are as shallow as 8 feet to 25-30 feet. Fish typically go deeper as the sun gets higher. ### Cut bait is still a good way to pick up a big fish. ### Brad reports that crappie have moved back onto the brush, and the best brush piles seem to be along the river channels and not back in the creeks. Fish are generally 6-10 feet down in 12-15 feet of water. Double anchoring and dropping down minnows has been the best pattern. ### Catfish can still be caught anchoring on red clay points and fan-casting baits at a variety of depths, with Chris reporting that 1- to 10-pound blues and channels in the same shallow areas as striper. Anchoring on humps in the 20- to 35-foot range is the better pattern for bigger, but fewer, blues. Some humps and points will produce a mixed bag of striper, hybrids, blues and channel cats that can fill up a cooler quickly! ### Contact sports writer Skylar Rolstad at 223-1813 or follow him on Twitter @SkyRolSports.",060119,1,"Clear skies.

81057,"Email ### wtvd ### VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- Officials have identified the gunman who killed 12 people and then was shot by officers at a Virginia Beach municipal building Friday as DeWayne Craddock. ### Authorities used a Saturday morning news conference to focus on the victims . They projected photos on a screen and gave each victim's name along with biographical details. ### Officials identified Craddock for the first time after talking about the victims. They said they would name Craddock only once and will not refer to him again. ### EMBED More News Videos ### The city of Virginia Beach identified the 12 victims killed after a longtime city employee opened fire in a municipal building Friday. ### Craddock, who had been employed by the city for 15 years as a city public utilities engineer, stormed the building and opened fire Friday afternoon on three different floors of the city building, according to investigators. Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said Craddock engaged in a ""long gunbattle"" with law enforcement officers. He said officers gave Craddock first aid after he was shot, but he died. ### Hansen said Craddock was still employed at the time of the shooting Friday afternoon and possessed a security pass that allowed him access to nonpublic areas of the municipal building. Neither Hansen nor Cervera would comment on whether Craddock was facing disciplinary or termination proceedings at the time of the shooting. ### Craddock used a .45-caliber handgun with a suppressor in the killings, Cervera said, adding that officers recovered ""additional weapons"" at the scene and at Craddock's home.  Craddock appeared to have had no felony record, which would have made him eligible to purchase guns. ### Unlike some states, silencers are legal in Virginia, though it is illegal to have one in Virginia Beach per local ordinance. ### Joseph Scott, an engineering technician with the department of public works, said he had worked with Craddock before and had a brief interaction with him Friday. Scott said he saw him in the men's restroom about five minutes before the shooting. ### ""He was in there brushing his teeth, which he always did after he ate,"" Scott said. ""I said 'Hey, how you doing? What are you doing this weekend?' It was just a brief conversation."" ### EMBED More News Videos ### Police say 12 people have been killed and six others injured in a mass shooting at a municipal building in Virginia Beach. ### Scott said he left for the day right after and learned of the shooting when a co-worker and then his son called him asking if he was OK. ### ""I couldn't believe that it happened,"" he said. ### Scott said he worked in a different division from Craddock, whom he described as quiet, polite and a ""nice guy."" Scott said he thought Craddock was in good standing at work and had never heard negative reports about him. ### Craddock's neighbors said police swarmed the neighborhood of modest townhomes Friday in Virginia Beach. Some said he had lived there for at least 10 years. ### Several neighbors said Craddock was a clean-cut member of the neighborhood association board whose wife had left him some years ago. ### PHOTOS: Virginia Beach shooting victims ### The Associated Press contributed to this report.",060119,1,Authorities used a Saturday morning news conference to focus on the victims .

The performer scheduled to play Cherubino had gotten sick, and the company wanted the mezzo-soprano to make an unscheduled debut that night in Mozart's ""Le Nozze di Figaro."" ### ""I just need to find a baby sitter,"" Leonard said. ### Three days after her 29th birthday in February 2011, Leonard rushed through a one-woman rehearsal that lasted about 30 minutes per act — ""just add hot water. It's an instant opera"" she said with a chuckle. She took the Staatsoper stage hours later in a cast that included Luca Pisaroni, Erwin Schrott and Dorothea Röschmann. ### Such has been the life of Leonard, a two-time Grammy-winner and, at 37, a single mom and a sought-after singer. ### After starring in three productions at the Metropolitan Opera this season, she appears at Carnegie Hall on Monday night in an all-French program for new music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin. It's his first concert leading the Met Orchestra. ### ""This is probably for me one of the healthiest voices I have ever encountered in my life,"" Nézet-Séguin said. ""The incredible artistry and the attention to words and meaning that she brings to every role she approaches makes it a conductor's dream."" ### A native New Yorker, Leonard married New Zealand baritone Teddy Tahu Rhodes in 2008. They divorced and she has sole custody of Teo, who just turned 9. ### She asked advice once or twice from soprano Renée Fleming, who divorced while her daughters were young. Fleming thought back to what the late soprano Joan Sutherland once told her. ### ""She said, 'Have your children. She said her grandchildren were the greatest joy in her life. And she said it doesn't matter when it happens because you'll have this extraordinary family and you won't even remember the engagements that you lost,'"" Fleming recalled. ### Spending time with Teo caused Leonard to withdraw from the world premiere of ""Marnie"" at London's English National Opera in November 2017, though she sang the U.S. premiere last fall to kick of her Met season, which included a role debut in Debussy's "" Pelléas et Melisande "" and a shattering Blanche de la Force in Poulenc's ""Dialogues des Carmélites."" ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### ""She's one of our major, major artists who we plan to be closely connected to for the seasons to come,"" Met general manager Peter Gelb said, mentioning the role of Octavian in Strauss' ""Der Rosenkavalier"" as a future appearance. ### Growing up in Manhattan, Leonard studied ballet. She attended LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Juilliard. She made her professional debut as Zerlina in Mozart's ""Don Giovanni"" at Bordeaux, France, in 2006, her U.S. debut as Stéphano in Gounod's ""Roméo et Juliette"" in Atlanta the following January and her Met debut as Stéphano that September. ### Leonard has received notable notices in Mozart, Rossini and other composers of the central repertory, and she has impressed in contemporary operas that included "" Marnie ,"" Thomas Ades' ""The Tempest"" and Jennifer Higdon's ""Cold Mountain."" ### ""It's great when you have a living composer because you get so much more input on what their mind was thinking about when they wrote it and what they were hearing,"" Leonard said. ""The theater aspect of what we already do is, I think, why I'm in this in the first place."" ### Her acting can be intense, but deliberate. ### ""She will never throw at you big vocal or acting effects just for the sake of being with an effect, said Nézet-Séguin. ""It's always because it's very, very integrated and thought through. And I find this much more moving than some people who actually just go for the easy effect."" ### She was preparing Cherubino at England's Glyndenbourne Festival in 2012 when she flew back to record what has become a highlight for some opera singers: ""Sesame Street."" Appearing with Murray Monster and Ovejita on a ""People in Your Neighborhood"" segment that aired the following year, she sang an excerpt of ""Una voce poco fa"" from Rossini's ""Il Barbiere di Siviglia."" ### She's performed for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at the Supreme Court and had been cast by Mike Nichols alongside Meryl Streep in an HBO film of Terrence McNally's ""Master Class"" before the director died in 2014. ### ""You're so fortunate to have had that moment in time where that person and you connected just for a moment,"" Leonard said. ### Next season includes ""Werther"" at London's Royal Opera, ""La Cenerentola"" at the Dutch National Opera and ""Barbiere"" in Cincinnati, and a role debut in Bizet's ""Carmen"" is planned in a following season. She and Teo are splitting time between New York and Chicago, where she has a rental apartment near Wrigley Field and cousins who live in the area. ### ""I don't project a lot on myself in terms of where I think I'm going to be. For whatever reason, I never have,"" she said. ""I think it's always left me to be very happy where I am, which is great.

The win set up a matchup against rival Oklahoma State with a semifinals slot on the line. The schools have never played in the World Series. ### ""I think it's going to be a really good game,"" Juarez said. ""I think it's going to be an intense one. We're on the biggest stage in college softball. I think it's going to be a really awesome game tomorrow."" ### The odds appear stacked against Oklahoma State. Top-seeded Oklahoma (55-3) has won 23 straight against the Cowgirls and outscored them 16-2 in three meetings this season. But Oklahoma State beat Florida 2-1 on the strength of pitcher Samantha Show's two homers. And the Cowgirls fearlessly beat defending national champion Florida State on the road to reach the World Series. ### Show said she looks forward to the opportunity and the atmosphere Friday night. ### ""Crazy,"" Show said. ""I mean, it's what we dream of. One, playing in front of a crowd like that. Two, beating OU."" ### Oklahoma had a tough time making the matchup happen, but Juarez helped by giving up just two runs on four hits with nine strikeouts. Sydney Romero had two hits and scored twice for the Sooners. ### Claire Jenkins had two hits and scored twice for the eighth-seeded Crimson Tide (57-9). ### The game was tied at 1-all in the third when Jocelyn Alo's single scored Romero to give the Sooners a 2-1 lead. ### Alabama's Jenkins hit a homer in the fifth inning to tie it at 2. ### Oklahoma's Nicole Mendes tripled in the bottom of the sixth to score pinch-runner Raegan Rogers and give the Sooners the lead for good. ### ""I like to compete,"" Mendes said. ""This is where the biggest teams come to compete. I don't know, it just brings something out in me. I just get really excited and really amped up. It's anybody's game. Any team here can win it. I think that kind of lights a fire in me."" ### Now, Oklahoma has to remember to focus on the overall task — the chase for their third national title in four years. Oklahoma coach Patty Gasso said the Sooners need to ignore the hype about playing their rival. ### ""There's history,"" Gasso said. ""I know everybody wants to see it. We just want to find ways to win. We want to get ourselves to a place where we're playing on Sunday and not playing all day. That's the important thing. That's what we've got to focus on, not get caught up in the hype."" ### Alabama will play Florida in an elimination game on Saturday. ### ——— ### Follow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Under the leadership of Modi ji, I will try my best to fulfil these priorities,"" Shah tweeted in Hindi after assuming the charge. ### Shah also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving him the responsibility of the Home Ministry. ### ""Today, I have taken the charge as India's Home Minister.

Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik is also seen.

The Army has already finalised a blueprint for its reform including right-sizing of the force. ### His predecessor Nirmala Sitharaman had taken on the opposition head-on with her fiery defence of the Rafale fighter jet deal and it will be interesting to see how Singh deals with the issue. ### © Copyright 2019 PTI.

That run also included two victories at Roland Garros after trailing by a set and a break each time. ### But Osaka's mounting mistakes just kept accumulating against Siniakova, who never had reached the fourth round in singles in 18 previous Slam appearances. She is better known for her doubles success, winning championships at the French Open and Wimbledon last year and topping the rankings ### ""I mean, it's incredible. It's amazing. It's the thing I couldn't believe,"" said Siniakova, who will face 2017 U.S. Open runner-up Madison Keys next. ""It was my best tennis."" ### It decidedly was not Osaka's, who quickly gathered her things and headed to the Court Suzanne Lenglen locker room when the lopsided match was finished. ### Sports Videos ### She wound up with a hard-to-believe 38 unforced errors; Siniakova made only 13. ### And Osaka, so good lately at the biggest moments on her sport's biggest stages, wasn't able to come up with the goods on the hottest day of the tournament so far, with the temperature topping 80 degrees (approaching 30 Celsius). ### One key statistic: Osaka compiled seven break points in the first set but failed to convert a single one. She was 0 for 4 on break chances when Siniakova served out that set, then never managed to earn one in the second. ### Clay has never been Osaka's best surface. Her power game is served better by the speed of hard courts, in particular. That's why she still has not made it to the round of 16 at the French Open. ### The first tennis player from Japan to be ranked No. 1 thought she was better suited to contend this time and spoke about eyeing a third consecutive Grand Slam title. ### After going just 9-11 on clay over her career until this season, she was 9-1 in 2019 until Saturday's setback. ### The loss ends Osaka's run of 16 straight wins in Grand Slam tournaments, which included titles at the U.S. Open and Australian Open. ### Osaka's exit, a day after No. 2 Karolina Pliskova lost, leaves defending champion Simona Halep, at No. 3, as the highest-seeded woman remaining. Halep needed only 55 minutes to get to the fourth round with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over No. 27 Lesia Tsurenko. ### Keys, a semifinalist in Paris a year ago, advanced by beating qualifier Anna Blinkova 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-4. ### In men's action, No. 1 Novak Djokovic stretched his Slam winning streak to 24 matches as he seeks his fourth title in a row, eliminating 147th-ranked qualifier Salvatore Caruso of Italy 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. ### Also advancing were No. 5 Alexander Zverev, No. 6 Stefanos Tsitsipas, No. 9 Fabio Fognini and No. 24 Stan Wawrinka, the 2015 champion and 2017 runner-up at Roland Garros. ### Tsitsipas vs. Wawrinka, and Zverev vs. Fogning will be fourth-round matchups. ### ___",060119,1,"Japan's Naomi Osaka gets up after slipping during her third round match of the French Open tennis tournament against Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, Saturday, June 1, 2019.

94055,"BOOK REVIEW: Danger, beauty, suspense in 'The River's' wilderness ###  ### By Julia RubinThe Associated Press ### Saturday ### Jun 1, 2019 at 6:49 PM Jun 1, 2019 at 6:49 PM ### This novel about two Dartmouth College students on a canoe trip gone badly awry is partly an ode to the Northern wilderness, partly a survival how-to, and mostly a thriller — suspenseful and gut-wrenching. ### Best friends Wynn and Jack take a late-summer trip to Canada, paddling down a river that winds through lakes and over rapids on its way to Hudson Bay. Like the river, author Peter Heller's plot often takes its time, digressing to describe how the boys fillet a fish or make camp, or what the Northern Lights look like. But don't get lulled: There's action around the bend. ### The two friends, both country boys, are experts in the woods and on the water, where they are self-proclaimed ""minimalists"" — no phones, no frills. They also share ""a literary way of looking at the world,"" and frequently see it through the lenses of Edgar Allan Poe, Virgil, James Dickey and more. ### Their leisurely trip turns into a harrowing dash toward safety when both nature and other people turn violent. Nature dishes up a massive forest fire that bears down on them. The boys smell and hear the blaze long before they see it — the fleeing animals, the drifting smoke, the popping and hissing of trees. ### Meanwhile, human mysteries lurk: Wynn and Jack hear a man and woman arguing on the bank as their canoe glides by in the fog; when they return to warn the couple about the fire, they find nobody there. Later, a man turns up at their camp downriver, alone. Where is the woman? ### Heller, author of previous novels including ""The Dog Stars"" and ""Celine,"" dives deep into the details of wilderness camping — so deep that sometimes you just want to jump ahead and find out what happens. Likewise with his acute and poetic observations of nature. But he is setting the scene and establishing two likable and memorable characters in Wynn and Jack. Each brings a different perspective to the violence and tragedy they encounter. ### River travel has often been a metaphor for writers. At one point early on, as the boys approach some rapids, Heller writes that ""every river story they had ever read was just beneath the surface of their imaginations and must have fired them with extra energy and braced them, too, because at least half of those stories did not have happy endings."" ### Never miss a story ### Choose the plan that's right for you. ### Digital access or digital and print delivery.",060119,1,"This novel about two Dartmouth College students on a canoe trip gone badly awry is partly an ode to the Northern wilderness, partly a survival how-to, and mostly a thriller — suspenseful and gut-wrenching.###Best friends Wynn and Jack take a late-summer trip to Canada, paddling down a river that winds through lakes and over rapids on its way to Hudson Bay.

91863,"SEC revises conference alcohol policy ### SEC revises conference alcohol policy ### The Southeastern Conference today announced a revision to its existing limitations on the availability of alcoholic beverages at athletics events. ### Under this revised policy, each institution in the Conference now has the autonomy to determine the permissibility of selling alcoholic beverages in its athletics venues, subject to certain Conference-wide alcohol management expectations. ### The revised SEC policy on alcohol availability, which was approved during the Conference’s 2019 Spring Meetings, requires any SEC institution choosing to permit alcohol sales at athletics events to establish policies governing the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages consistent with requirements established and agreed to by the Conference membership. In the past, SEC athletics programs have been prohibited from selling alcohol in public areas of SEC athletics venues. ### The revised policy is not to be construed as a requirement or expectation that SEC institutions will sell alcohol at athletic events. Each institution has the autonomy to decide the permissibility of alcohol sales to the general public and to designate the locations where alcoholic beverages may be available, consistent with Conference-wide alcohol management expectations, each university’s policies, and state or local regulations governing alcohol sales and/or consumption. ### The revised policy adopted by the presidents and chancellors requires institutions to implement a series of Conference-wide alcohol management procedures, including the establishment of designated stationary sales locations, a restriction prohibiting sales by vendors in seating areas, a limit on the number of alcoholic beverages purchased per transaction and designated times that sales must cease specific to each athletics event. ### “We are proud of the great game-day atmospheres the SEC and our member schools have cultivated throughout our history, and no other conference rivals the SEC in terms of our ability to offer an intense yet family-friendly atmosphere for all of our fans,” said University of South Carolina President Harris Pastides, current chair of the SEC Presidents and Chancellors. “This policy is intended to enhance the game-day experience at SEC athletics events by providing our schools the autonomy to make appropriate decisions for their respective campuses while also establishing expectations for responsible management of the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages.” ### The adoption of the revised policy comes after a recommendation by a working group of campus leaders created at the May 2018 SEC Spring Meetings. The group was charged with a review of the existing Conference Game Management Policy governing the availability of alcoholic beverages at SEC athletics events and to identify a direction for consideration by the membership. ### “Our policy governing alcohol sales has been a source of considerable discussion and respectful debate among our member universities in recent years,” said SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey. “As a Conference, we have been observant of trends in the sale and consumption of alcohol at collegiate sporting events and have drawn upon the experiences and insights of our member schools which have responsibly established limited alcohol sales within controlled spaces and premium seating areas. We remain the only conference to set forth league-wide standards for the responsible management of the sale of alcoholic beverages.” ### Any sales of alcoholic beverages in the public seating areas will be limited to beer and wine, and each institution that chooses to sell alcohol will be required to implement a server training program for staff. ### “We are committed as a Conference to ensuring that all changes in policy are implemented in ways that respect and sustain the traditions that make the SEC game-day experience exceptional for all attendees,” Sankey said. ### The policy, which is effective August 1, 2019, does not impact suites, clubs or private leased areas in which the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages was previously permitted under existing SEC regulations. ### Members of the SEC Working Group included Stuart Bell, President of the University of Alabama, Michael Sagas, Faculty Athletics Representative at the University of Florida; Hunter Yurachek, Director of Athletics at the University of Arkansas; Sarah Reesman, Senior Deputy Athletics Director at the University of Missouri; and Troy Lane, Chief of Police at the University of Tennessee. ### SEC Game Management Policy on Alcohol (adopted May 31, 2019; effective August 1, 2019): ### Each institution is permitted to determine the permissibility of selling alcoholic beverages in athletics venues and shall establish a policy governing the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in its athletics facilities. ### Institutions that offer alcohol sales in public areas must incorporate Conference-wide alcohol management expectations, which include: ### – Alcoholic beverages are to be sold and dispensed only at designated stationary locations; ### – Alcoholic beverages may not be sold by vendors within the seating areas; ### – Identification check is required at every point of sale to prevent sales to minors; ### – Alcoholic beverage sales are limited to beer and wine only (no hard liquor or mixed drinks may be sold in public seating areas); ### – Limits must be established on the number of drinks purchased at one time by an individual; ### – Alcohol must be dispensed into cups; ### – Safe server training and additional training for staff to handle high risk situations is required; and ### – Designated stop times for sale and/or distribution of alcohol must be enforced as follows: Football (end of 3rd quarter); Basketball (Men’s-Second half 12-minute TV timeout; Women’s-End of 3rd quarter); Baseball (end of the top of 7th inning); Softball (end of the top of the 5th inning); and Other Sports (At a designated time, no later than when 75% of the event’s regulation length competition is scheduled to be completed). ### Each year, the Conference membership shall review this policy to determine institutional compliance with established expectations and evaluate fan conduct and alcohol-related incidents for the purpose of determining the need to revise the Conference’s alcohol policy. ### Implementation of these management expectations does not include suites, clubs or private leased areas. ### Each institution shall establish a policy for the admission of outside food and beverage into its facilities. ### As with all areas of the stadium, maintaining the safety of patrons and participants and maintaining an atmosphere suitable for families is of utmost importance. ### Advertising displays mentioning or promoting alcoholic beverage shall not be permitted in any playing facility with the exception of common point-of-sale signage. ### (press release courtesy of secsports.com)",060119,1,"Each year, the Conference membership shall review this policy to determine institutional compliance with established expectations and evaluate fan conduct and alcohol-related incidents for the purpose of determining the need to revise the Conference’s alcohol policy.###Implementation of these management expectations does not include suites, clubs or private leased areas.###Each institution shall establish a policy for the admission of outside food and beverage into its facilities.###As with all areas of the stadium, maintaining the safety of patrons and participants and maintaining an atmosphere suitable for families is of utmost importance.###Advertising displays mentioning or promoting alcoholic beverage shall not be permitted in any playing facility with the exception of common point-of-sale signage.###(press release courtesy of secsports.com)","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53]","<p>Each year, the Conference membership shall review this policy to determine institutional compliance with established expectations and evaluate fan conduct and alcohol-related incidents for the purpose of determining the need to revise the Conference’s alcohol policy.</p><p>Implementation of these management expectations does not include suites, clubs or private leased areas.</p><p>Each institution shall establish a policy for the admission of outside food and beverage into its facilities.</p><p>As with all areas of the stadium, maintaining the safety of patrons and participants and maintaining an atmosphere suitable for families is of utmost importance.</p><p>Advertising displays mentioning or promoting alcoholic beverage shall not be permitted in any playing facility with the exception of common point-of-sale signage.</p><p>(press release courtesy of secsports.com)</p>"
6447,"Southwest monsoon: Don’t bet your farm on it ### Southwest monsoon: Don’t bet your farm on it ### Southwest monsoon: Don’t bet your farm on it ### X Share via ### Jun 01 2019, 22:28pm ist ### updated: Jun 01 2019, 22:40pm ist ### The Southwest monsoon is the most anticipated season in India due to the impact it has on agriculture in the country, with its direct and indirect effects on not just the country’s farmers but also the macroeconomy. Agriculture in India is largely rain-fed, and a poor monsoon or drought can have a huge bearing on farmers and the farm-dependent economy of the country. Alarmingly, Skymet has forecast the Southwest monsoon 2019 to be below normal at 93% of the LPA (Long Period Average of June, July, August and September (JJAS) -- 887 mm) with an error margin of +/-5%. ### If we look at the spatial distribution, rainfall in East and Northeast India -- the rainiest pocket in the country during the Southwest Monsoon -- is 92% of the LPA, while in Central India, which stands second in terms of monsoon rain, the probability of rainfall is 91%. In the other two pockets of Northwest India and the Southern Peninsula, the prospect of rain is 91% and 95%, respectively. ### On the probabilities of normal, below normal, drought or excess rain, the following figures are the assessment of Skymet. ### Monsoon 2019 probabilities for JJAS are: ### 0% chance of excess (seasonal rainfall that is more than 110% of LPA) ### 0% chance of above normal (seasonal rainfall that is between 105 to 110% of LPA) ### 30% chance of normal (seasonal rainfall that is between 96 to 104% of LPA) ### 55% chance of below normal (seasonal rainfall that is between 90 to 95% of LPA) ### 15% chance of drought (seasonal rainfall that is less than 90% of LPA) ###  ### El Niño, which is the unusual warming of the Eastern Pacific Ocean, has been impacting monsoon rains in India more often than normal in the recent past. This time, too, El Niño seems to be disrupting the monsoon pattern of the country. Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal in East India, along with central parts of the country, predominantly Vidarbha, Marathwada, southern parts of Madhya Pradesh and some parts of Gujarat, are going to bear the maximum brunt of the El Niño phenomenon. ### Currently, the probability of El Niño condition is still over 60% through summer 2019, which includes the monsoon months. We can expect a decline in El Niño, but chances would still remain as high as 50% during the winter months. ### The months of March, April and May have been fairly warm and with SST (Sea Surface Temperature) maintaining its threshold value, El Niño conditions continue to prevail, though on a devolving note. This clearly indicates a below normal monsoon rain in the country this year. ### According to records, in the past 28 years from 1991 to 2018, El Niño was present in 10 years (1991, 1994, 1997, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2014, 2015 & 2018) during the Southwest monsoon. Two (1991 & 2018) out of the 10 El Niño years witnessed below normal or deficient rainfall while five years (2002, 2004, 2009, 2014 & 2015) witnessed drought. ### Out of the 10 El Niño years, food grain production declined in seven years, with 2002 witnessing the steepest decline of 22%. Pulses (Kharif + Rabi) saw a decrease in production in six years out of 10, with a reduction of 16.7% in 2002. Soybean saw a decrease in production in five years out of 10, with a reduction of 22% in 2002. Rice saw a decrease in production in five years out of 10, with a reduction of 23% in 2002. Scanty rainfall this monsoon season will perhaps put the country in a similar situation. ### About half of the food grain production in India comes from the Kharif output, which stands at around 140 million tons. The quantum and distribution of monsoon have a direct bearing on the sowing operations of Kharif and subsequent crops over many regions of the country. ### According to an analysis carried out by Skymet, paddy production is likely to go down in the upcoming Kharif season (2019-2020) to 97.78 million tons, which is a fall of about 4% compared to the 101.96 million tons produced last year. The area under paddy cultivation would remain the same. However, the vagaries of monsoon are expected to affect the yield primarily in the rain-fed areas. West Bengal, the largest paddy producing state in the country, is at the maximum risk of receiving poor monsoon rain. ### However, soybean production is likely to increase by around 0.14% to 13.71 million tons, compared to 13.69 million tons the previous season. The area under soybean cultivation is likely to go up by 3.2%, but the increase in production will be marginal due to the forecast of below-normal rain. ### Cotton production in the country is also expected to increase by 15.5% to 34.74 million bales in 2019-20, compared to 30.08 million bales last year. Cotton acreage on a national basis is likely to be higher by 2.7% to 12.57 million hectares. This is some good news for the cotton farmers staring at a gloomy monsoon season. ### Agriculture contributes about 16% of India’s GDP. Therefore, a good monsoon is imperative for a bumper farm output, which helps in keeping food prices and inflation under check. High agricultural production also pushes up the incomes of rural people, which in turn boosts demand for consumer goods. Government spending also declines in a good monsoon year. ### But with monsoon 2019 forecast at 93% of the LPA, the scenario does not look too good. ### (The writer is founder and managing director, Skymet Weather Services)",060119,1,"El Niño, which is the unusual warming of the Eastern Pacific Ocean, has been impacting monsoon rains in India more often than normal in the recent past.

(Emilio Naranjo/EPA-EFE) ### comments ### No tears of pain this time, just redemption for Mohamed Salah. ### Only 108 seconds were needed to banish the Champions League final heartbreak of a year ago. ### Once Salah dispatched his early penalty against Tottenham, Liverpool was on the path to a sixth European title with a 2-0 victory on Saturday. ### And a year after defeat in the final to Real Madrid, Juergen Klopp has his first title after four years as Liverpool manager. ### A shoulder injury forced Salah out of the Kyiv showpiece last year. ### WATCH | Liverpool claim 6th Champions League crown ### The Belgian scored an insurance marker in the 87th minute to help lead Liverpool to a 2-0 win over Tottenham in the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final. 1:14 ### This time it was Tottenham midfielder Moussa Sissoko's arm that gifted Liverpool the early penalty opening — blocking Sadio Mane's shot after 21 seconds — and Salah converted from the spot after a video review check. ### ""I have sacrificed a lot for my career,"" Salah said. ""To come from a village, to go to Cairo, and to be an Egyptian at this level is unbelievable for me."" ### Mo Salah, right, scores the game opener from the penalty spot against Tottenham's goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, left. (Tolga Bozoglu/EPA-EFE) ### On a hot and humid night in Madrid, Tottenham came to life only in the final 20 minutes of its first European Cup final. ### But Liverpool completed the job in the 87th minute thanks to one of its semifinal saviours. ### Divock Origi had to accept a place back on the bench despite producing two goals while deputizing for the injured Salah last month. But the substitute had the final big say in the Spanish capital, rifling a left-footed shot inside the far post. ### ""Every single player fought hard today,"" Origi said. ""So it's just special."" ### After two losing finals since triumphing in 2005, Liverpool finally rose to third in the all-time list of European champions behind 13-time winner Real Madrid and AC Milan on seven titles. ### Few fans — even from Liverpool — will want to watch just how it was achieved. ### Both sides had gone three weeks without playing. It showed. ### Spurs' Cinderella season ends ### The sharpness was deficient, as was the ability to string passes together. ### ""When we look back on tonight we aren't going to think it was a sluggish game,"" Liverpool-born defender Trent Alexander-Arnold said. ""We are going to think we have just won the European Cup."" ### Tottenham will have only regrets as its luck run out after a season of comebacks and great escapes in the competition with a squad that had no additions. ### Lucas Moura's goal in Barcelona in December carried Tottenham into the round of 16. The Brazilian's hat trick last month then completed a turnaround against Ajaxe. The reward in Madrid was a watching brief from the bench for two thirds of the game. ### Instead, Harry Kane was thrust into the starting lineup despite 53 days without a game since limping off with an ankle injury in the quarterfinal first leg against Manchester City. ### Liverpool's Georginio Wijnaldum, left, and Tottenham's Harry Kane react during the UEFA Champions League final. (Tolga Bozoglu/EPA-EFE) ### The striker was largely anonymous as Tottenham, which finished 26 points behind Premier League runner-up Liverpool in fourth place, couldn't even get a shot on target until the 73rd minute. ### Alisson Becker scooped up a spinning shot from Dele Alli and made a double-save from Son Heung-min and Moura with 10 minutes to go. ### It was goalkeeping that made the difference, showing $85 million was well spent by American owner John Henry after Loris Karius was banished for making costly mistakes in last year's final. ### ""You have a goalkeeper who makes difficult things look easy,"" Klopp said. ""Thank you very much."" ### Klopp tastes glory ### No wonder Klopp was relieved after six losing finals, stretching back to his spell at Borussia Dortmund. ### ""Did you ever see a team like this? Fighting with no fuel in the tank,"" the German said. ### Victory against Tottenham came six years after Dortmund was beaten by Bayern Munich in the Champions League final. ### Klopp is now European champion for the first time. ### ""I am so happy for my family,"" he said. ""They suffer every year when we go to a final, the last game of the season."" ### The penultimate game saw Klopp miss out on ending Liverpool's 29-year English title drought by a point to Manchester City in the Premier League title race. ### ""We are doing good stuff,"" Klopp said on the field amid the celebrations in Madrid. ""People are always saying, 'Why didn't you win anything?""' ### They can't anymore at Liverpool. ### European Cups Titles ### Bayern Munich (Germany), Barcelona (Spain) - 5 ### Ajax (Netherlands) - 4 ### Inter Milan (Italy), Manchester United (England) - 3 ### Benfica (Portugal), Juventus (Italy), Nottingham Forest (England), Porto (Portugal) - 2 ### Aston Villa (England), Borussia Dortmund (Germany), Chelsea (England), Feyenoord (Netherlands), Glasgow Celtic (Scotland), Hamburg (West Germany), Marseille (France), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Red Star Belgrade (Yugoslavia), Steaua Bucharest (Romania) - 1",060119,1,"And a year after defeat in the final to Real Madrid, Juergen Klopp has his first title after four years as Liverpool manager.###A shoulder injury forced Salah out of the Kyiv showpiece last year.###WATCH | Liverpool claim 6th Champions League crown###The Belgian scored an insurance marker in the 87th minute to help lead Liverpool to a 2-0 win over Tottenham in the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final. 1:14###This time it was Tottenham midfielder Moussa Sissoko's arm that gifted Liverpool the early penalty opening — blocking Sadio Mane's shot after 21 seconds — and Salah converted from the spot after a video review check.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]","<p>And a year after defeat in the final to Real Madrid, Juergen Klopp has his first title after four years as Liverpool manager.</p><p>A shoulder injury forced Salah out of the Kyiv showpiece last year.</p><p>WATCH | Liverpool claim 6th Champions League crown</p><p>The Belgian scored an insurance marker in the 87th minute to help lead Liverpool to a 2-0 win over Tottenham in the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final. 1:14</p><p>This time it was Tottenham midfielder Moussa Sissoko's arm that gifted Liverpool the early penalty opening — blocking Sadio Mane's shot after 21 seconds — and Salah converted from the spot after a video review check.</p>"

Oh God!’ Ex-wife of child killer Tim Jones collapses on witness stand ### May 20, 2019 7:52 PM ### The defense’s last three witnesses were psychiatrists whose testimony will be crucial in the jury’s deliberations. ### In a death penalty case where a defendant is pleading “not guilty by reason of insanity,” as Jones is doing, the jury under state law has three main choices: “guilty,” “not guilty by reason of insanity” and “guilty but mentally ill.” The jury also has the choice of finding Jones “not guilty,” but he has confessed to killing his five children, then driving around the Southeast for more than a week with their bodies in the back of his SUV. He eventually dumped them in rural Alabama. ### There are differing complex standards for each jury finding. If the jury finds “guilty,” that means it believes Jones knew the killings were wrong from a moral and legal standpoint. A finding of “not guilty by reason of insanity” means the jury believes Jones was living in a completely delusional world and didn’t know what he was doing was wrong, from either a legal or moral standpoint A finding of “guilty but mentally ill” means the jury found Jones’s judgment was impaired by mental illness but he knew right from wrong. ### Dorney’s testimony Friday illustrated the complexities of the case. ### She recalled earlier testimony that Jones accidentally killed his son, Nahtahn, 6, by making him do an excessive amount of exercise, and the child likely dehydrated and died. Jones’ strict religious beliefs about child punishment were so intense as to be delusional and therefore insane, Dorney told jurors. Jones’s beliefs that he had a moral right to punish Nahtahn that way, even if the boy died accidentally as a result, constituted insanity, Dorney said. ### Dorney also labeled as “insane” Jones’ methodical killings of his remaining four children — Merah, 8; Elias, 7; Gabriel, 2, and Abigail Elaine, 1 — when he choked them to death one-by-one. Although he knew what his actions were a crime, Jones’ delusional religious beliefs convinced him that killing them was the right thing to do. ### Jones said he didn’t want the surviving four children growing up without a mother or a father and instead, he wanted to send them to heaven where they would all be together, taken care of and where he would see them some day, testified Dorney. ### Jones believed “to a moral certainty” that he was doing the right thing when he killed them, and that meant he was insane, she testified. ### Her ultimate diagnoses for Jones: schizoaffective disorder. ### “It is a combination of psychotic symptoms or thought disorder and a mood disorder,” she testified. People with that diagnosis can have hallucinations or delusions and mania and depression. ### Dorney estimated she stands to be paid at least some $30,000 by the defense for the 100 hours she spent on the case so far. ### Jones’s thinking was so deranged the night he killed the children because over the past few weeks he had increasingly been working himself up into a paranoid mental state where he lost completely touch with reality, Dorney told the jury. Jones was in a manic and psychotic state marked by lack of sleep, major depression and increased use of Spice, a drug that made him lose touch with reality. He also increasingly believed his children were plotting to kill him, she testified. ### Another psychiatrist testifying for the defense Friday was Beverly Wood, who works for the S.C. Department of Corrections and has treated Jones for nearly four years, ever since his arrest. ### Wood, who was not paid by the defense for her testimony, did not label Jones insane but said he is clearly unbalanced. ### “He has a mental illness that has psychotic components,” Wood testified, adding Jones defies easy labels. ### Follow more of our reporting on",060119,1,"In a death penalty case where a defendant is pleading “not guilty by reason of insanity,” as Jones is doing, the jury under state law has three main choices: “guilty,” “not guilty by reason of insanity” and “guilty but mentally ill. ” The jury also has the choice of finding Jones “not guilty,” but he has confessed to killing his five children, then driving around the Southeast for more than a week with their bodies in the back of his SUV.

48718,"Bees' Ward comes up grand on five-hit night ### Angels farmhand collects slam, four singles, scores three times ### Taylor Ward had five career four-hit games, most recently on July 4 with Salt Lake. (Bobby Stevens/MiLB.com) ### By Katie Woo / MiLB.com | June 1, 2019 2:16 AM ### The hits were bountiful for Triple-A Salt Lake on Friday night, especially for Taylor Ward, who enjoyed a career night in the city where he attended college. ### The Bees' leadoff man went 5-for-6 with a grand slam as Salt Lake routed Fresno, 13-1, at Chukchansi Park. Ward scored three times in his first career five-hit game. ### Video: Ward rips grand slam for Salt Lak e ### The effort even surprised Ward, who didn't know he'd achieved a personal milestone until after the game was over. ### ""Wait, really?"" he said of his first five-hit game, pausing before laughing. ""I didn't know that. That's pretty sweet."" ### Ward led off the game against veteran right-hander Joe Ross with a routine groundout to first base, but it was the only time the Grizzlies were able to retire the Fresno State product. ### The 25-year-old won his second matchup with Ross, jumping on the first pitch and lining it to left field for a two-out single in the third inning. Ward tacked on two more singles to left -- one in the fourth off Scott Copeland and another in the sixth off Henderson Alvarez III, another big league veteran. But it was his at-bat in the seventh that did serious damage. ### Fresno reliever George Kontos came on to start the seventh and allowed a leadoff single to Wilfredo Tovar. He struck out Ty Kelly, then walked Angels No. 27 prospect  Brennon Lund and Roberto Pena on eight consecutive pitches to load the bases. Ward exercised caution at the plate, forcing Kontos to throw a strike before swinging. He worked the count to 2-0, then let a slider pass for a strike before barreling Kontos' next offering over the left field fence for his first career slam. ### Gameday box score ### ""I was waiting for him to throw a strike,"" Ward said. ""I wanted to make him put one in the zone. He did, and I took advantage of it."" ### Although Ward primarily plays third base in the Angels system, he was drafted as a catcher and spent his first three years in the Minor Leagues behind the plate. He often taps his experience calling pitches to help his thought process at the plate. On Friday, it paid off. ### ""He'd thrown two fastballs before that, which he threw for balls and then threw a slider for a strike,"" Ward said. ""In my head, I was hoping he'd throw that again. Back in the day when I caught, in moments like that as a catcher I would have [my pitcher] throw that same pitch again because he was landing it. I thought of that as a hitter in that situation."" ### The big fly was the Bees' Minor League-leading eighth slam of the season, putting them two away from matching the 2013 franchise record. ### Even with a grand slam that doubled as his 10th homer of the year, Ward wasn't done. He lined one more single to left with one out in the ninth off shortstop Matt Reynolds, Fresno's fifth pitcher. ### Prior to the five-hit effort, the 2015 first-round pick had five four-hit games in his Minor League career, the most recent coming last July 4. ### Ward has bounced between the Majors and Minors over the last two seasons. He earned a promotion to the Pacific Coast League in June 2018 after hitting .345/.453/.520 for Double-A Mobile and was called up to the big leagues in mid-August after putting up a .352 average in 60 games with Salt Lake. In 40 games with the Angels, he hit .178.",060119,1,"The 25-year-old won his second matchup with Ross, jumping on the first pitch and lining it to left field for a two-out single in the third inning.

The city's visibly shaken mayor, Bobby Dyer, called it ""the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach."" ### The shooting happened shortly after 4 p.m. when the veteran employee of the Public Utilities Department entered a building in the city's Municipal Center, and ""immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all of the victims,"" Cervera said. Authorities did not release the suspect's name, instead choosing to focus on the victims during a news conference. ### Police entered the building and got out as many employees as they could, then exchanged fire with the suspect, who was armed with a .45-caliber handgun, the chief said. ""It was a long gunbattle between those four officers and the suspect,"" he said. He said officers gave the suspect first aid after he was shot, but he died. ### Police initially said the gunman shot and killed 11 people, including one who was found inside a vehicle outside the municipal building. Cervera later said one more died on the way to the hospital. ### The shooting sent shock waves through Virginia Beach, the state's largest city and a popular vacation spot in southeastern Virginia. The building where the attack took place is in a suburban complex miles away from the high-rise hotels along the beach and the downtown business area. ### Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a statement he was devastated by the ""unspeakable, senseless violence,"" and is offering the state's full support to survivors and relatives of the victims. ### ""That they should be taken in this manner is the worst kind of tragedy,"" the governor said during the news conference. ### The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed and was monitoring the situation. ### Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting happened, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded herself and about 20 colleagues inside an office, pushing a desk against a door. ### ""We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,"" she said. ""We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn't real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots."" ### She texted her mom, telling her that there was an active shooter in the building and she and others were waiting for police. ### ""Thank God my baby is OK,"" Banton's mother, Dana Showers, said. ### At a nearby middle school, friends and relatives were reuniting with loved ones who were in the building when the shooting happened. They included Paul Swain, 50, who said he saw his fiancee from across the parking lot, clearly in an agitated state. ### ""I think she knew some of the people,"" he said. ### Outside the school, Cheryl Benn, 65, waited while her husband, David, a traffic engineer with the city who was in the building where the shooting happened, gave a written statement to detectives. ### She said her husband initially called her from a barricaded room and said it sounded as if someone had been working with a nail gun. Then he saw the bodies. ### ""This is unbelievable for Virginia Beach,"" Cheryl Benn said. ""By and large, it's a pretty calm and peaceful place to live."" ### ___ ### Associated Press writers Regina Garcia Cano in Washington, D.C.; Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia; and Tom Foreman Jr. in Charlotte, North Carolina, contributed to this report. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

We have tripped ourselves up in the past and will be careful not to do so again. We will look at what we did today and where we need to improve and will have a look at Samoa's strengths and weaknesses,” Powell said. ### He was pleased with most of Day 1's showing. ### ""I am very happy with the first two matches. It is always tough playing against teams fighting for their survival in the series. They have to win to keep their chances alive and we did well to keep Wales and Kenya out.” ### The third match, against Australia, was a tight affair. ### “The first three minutes against Australia was great, but then we lost some structure. We need to be better than that, but it was a good win in the end.” ### In their first match, the Welsh held possession for most of the first half, with outstanding defence by the Blitzboks keeping them out away from the tryline. Muller du Plessis scored after six minutes of play when the South Africans managed to get their hands on the ball. Branco du Preez converted in what was the only score of the half. ### The second half started well for South Africa with Cecil Afrika, back in the team after a year on the sideline, dummied his way over the line, before Du Preez used his soccer skills to get his 93rd career five-pointer. ### Wales scored a breakaway try when Joe Goodchild intercepted a pass, but Mfundo Ndhlovu finished off a strong run and a 22-7 win. ### Kenya came hard at the Blitzboks in the breakdown area, but an early try by Du Plessis gave his team some confidence. Siviwe Soyizwapi then rounded his man beautifully to score in the corner and pushed the lead to 10-0. ### Kenya scored twice in quick succession though, with their second long after the half-time buzzer to hold a 12-10 lead. ### The Blitzboks’ bench provided big impact though. After Du Plessis scored a second to edge his side ahead, tries by Impi Visser and Ndhlovu eased out the game. Both were converted by Dewald Human. ### The match against Australia, who edged the Blitzboks 29-22 in London a week ago, was intriguing to say the least. ### The South Africans started well with two quick tries, by Justin Geduld and JC Pretorius respectively. Both were converted and the Blitzboks seemed to be in control, especially after Australia was shown a yellow card with two minutes left of the half. ### The men in yellow showed some urgency though and scored twice in that time to go into half-time still in the contest. ### The next try, fairly early in the second half, proved crucial as Impi Visser found space afforded by a great pass from Justin Geduld and he crashed over for his 13th try of the season, pushing the Blitzboks lead out to nine points. ### Australia came back again, with Will Maddocks scoring a converted try to cut the lead to two. ### But the Blitzboks kept their defence intact and won the match, with the result sending Australia out of Cup contention, with Kenya sneaking into the second Cup quarters spot. ### Scorers:",060119,1,"Kenya came hard at the Blitzboks in the breakdown area, but an early try by Du Plessis gave his team some confidence.

The Blackcats have won eight of their 10 state tournament games in five appearances since 2012. ### “It’s a great program and that’s just what we want,” said coach Shanna Green. “Not just for the girls, but it’s the community’s team. You have these extracurriculars in the school that are so successful that they draw people to the community. That’s what we want.” ### It took a while for Goreville to get what it wanted against freshman pitcher Kierston McCoy. Throwing strikes and changing speeds perfectly, McCoy limited the Blackcats to one hit through five innings – an Adrianna Licka single in the third. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### But SIU Edwardsville signee Lexi King touched McCoy for a one-out single in the sixth. A throwing error on Kelsey Ray’s grounder to short enabled King to reach third. Sam Licka popped an RBI double to left-center, advancing Ray to third, and Abby King blooped an RBI double down the left field line to equalize. ### Chloe Wolaver’s two-out grounder to short was muffed for an error that scored the go-ahead run. Kyleigh Massey beat out an infield single to plate Abby King with the final run. ### Lexi King (8-6) wasted no time closing the last game of a great high school career. She mowed down the Tigers (24-6) on eight pitches in the seventh, inducing a game-ending topper to the circle. King’s teammates dog-piled on top of her between the circle and plate. ### “It’s been an amazing feeling playing at Goreville the last three years,” she said. “I’ve loved every single teammate I’ve ever had. It’s an amazing feeling to go out this way.” ### Subscribe to Daily Headlines ### Sign up!

(AP) — Brian Deegan can tell you about the time he failed a backflip attempt with his motorcycle for a TV stunt and crashed with such a thud that the handlebar ripped up his gut like a gunshot and he almost died. ### Gnarly stuff. ### But it's not as scary as watching his 17-year-old daughter hop in a stock car and zip around a 2 1/2-mile track at the type of speeds that would make any dad cringe. ### ""Like, 190 mph for my daughter, I'm kind of scared as a dad,"" Deegan said. ### Hailie Deegan has given dad — a 10-time X-Games medalist and founding member of the Metal Mulisha — little reason to worry on the race track. All the teen sensation has done is put the sport on notice that she could be one of the next wave of stars in NASCAR — but please, no D word. ### Danica. ### Deegan has been a force driving in the entry-level ARCA Series (she finished seventh Friday at Pocono Raceway) and has a win in each of the last two NASCAR K&N Series seasons. Like many photogenic teen influencers, she's building her brand on Instagram (400,000-plus followers) and has already served as a guest host for NASCAR.com at Daytona 500 media day. ### But as the wins and top-10s start to pile up, so do the comparisons to Danica Patrick, the last female to drive in the Cup Series. Patrick was winless in 253 races over six seasons and her NASCAR career never matched the accolades and fame she found in entertainment and other business endeavors. ### ""Lot of respect to Danica,"" Brian Deegan said. ""The more Hailie's gone through the series, it's almost worked against her at times. People are like, 'Oh, she's just another Danica. Oh, she's going to crash.' There's the good and bad with that. We have a lot of respect for everything she's ever done. As a female, she reached the highest points of racing. But there's still room for goals to be broken. It's going to be a long road for Hailie to be in Cup, but that is our goal."" ### Hailie Deegan is bubbly at the mic and fierce behind the wheel, a win-win combination that has won her scores of fans, even with a potential Cup ride still years away. ### ""It's kind of hard to handle the pressure of having to live up those expectations,"" she said. ### Her adventures are chronicled on the family's YouTube channel Deegan38 which has nearly 450,000 subscribers. Brian Deegan sat in a media seat and filmed his daughter's press conference Friday at Pocono Raceway for use in a future upload. ### ""We've had offers to do reality shows. But at the end of the day, I want to tell our story our way,"" Brian Deegan said. ""That's why we do it on YouTube. Everyone has access to that."" ### She was the only driver not in the Cup or Xfinity Series brought into the media center and was all smiles answering questions she's surely heard hundreds of times before. ### ""She's a female. She's getting attention. I get it,"" Brian Deegan said. ### She's keeps her goals limited to how she can improve each weekend and says she has much to learn racing against drivers with years and years of experience. Deegan is still learning the ropes of stock cars, spending time this week in the Toyota Racing simulator because, ""I've never been on a track this big."" ### ""I've never done a draft or anything like that,"" Deegan said. ""That's all new to me. I've got to figure it out during the race, honestly."" ### Deegan, who turns 18 in July, said it would be a ""big jump"" to consider a full season 2020 ride in the Xfinity or Truck Series but would like to ""maybe"" try a few races in the lower-level NASCAR series. ### She grew up going to motocross races with her dad. Brian Deegan became a cult icon for the crazy stunts he pulled on a motorcycle, to say nothing of the devastating crashes that left him with broken bones too numerous to count. She was 8 when she climbed into her own truck the first time. She won a championship and quickly moved up the ranks, reaching the pro level a few years ago. ### ""I wanted to her race, yes. But stock cars kind of came out of the blue,"" Brian Deegan said. ""The end game for a female in racing is NASCAR. It's the biggest platform you could be in in America."" ### ——",060119,1,"Hailie Deegan has given dad — a 10-time X-Games medalist and founding member of the Metal Mulisha — little reason to worry on the race track.

He has been charged with four counts of aggravated murder and six counts of kidnapping. ### ""There are no words to describe the pure evil that exists within Samuel Little,"" O'Malley said in a statement. ""His heinous disregard for human life is incomprehensible."" ### Little is possibly the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history, surpassing the likes of John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy and Green River's Gary Ridgway. Little was convicted in California of three slayings in 2013 and pleaded to another killing last year in Texas , where he's currently incarcerated. ### Little told authorities he killed five women in Ohio, including three who lived around Cleveland, during a murder spree that began in 1970 when he was 30 years old and ended 35 years later, O'Malley said. ### The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Office's Cold Case Unit was able to identify Peyton and Evans as Little's victims and is trying to determine with other law enforcement agencies the identity of the third woman, O'Malley said. ### The FBI in February released sketches drawn by Little of some of his victims based on his memories of them. Agents who have interviewed Little said he remembers his victims and the killings in great detail, including where he was and what car he was driving. ### The FBI said Little targeted ""vulnerable women who were often involved in prostitution and addicted to drugs."" ### Ector County District Attorney Bobby Bland in Odessa, Texas, said 50 cold homicide cases have been closed as a result of Little's confessions and that most of the remaining unsolved slayings occurred in California.  ### Texas",060119,1,"Man who admitted to serial killings charged in 2 more deaths###Man who admitted to serial killings charged in 2 more deaths###By MARK GILLISPIE, Associated Press###May 31, 2019###Comments###2","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]","<p>Man who admitted to serial killings charged in 2 more deaths</p><p>Man who admitted to serial killings charged in 2 more deaths</p><p>By MARK GILLISPIE, Associated Press</p><p>May 31, 2019</p><p>Comments</p><p>2</p>"

CHS has won 25 straight games. George Robinson, USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee ### CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE ### April 16 was a special day for Tennessee senior Haley Bearden. ### The Lady Vols softball star smashed a pair of grand slams en route to an 11-0 victory over East Tennessee State. ### ""I told myself, do something good to honor Donny,"" Bearden said. ### April 16 is the birthday of former Clarksville and Vanderbilt pitching star Donny Everett, who drowned in 2016. Bearden was the same year as Everett at Clarksville and knew the CHS baseball legend well. ### Last Slide Next Slide ### Bearden's two homers and eight RBIs that day was the standout individual performance during the last half of the Lady Vols season, which ended against Florida on Sunday in the NCAA super regional. ### ""I had great times in Knoxville,"" Bearden said. ""I've learned so much about myself in the process and I wouldn't trade the experience. I'd love to still be playing in the Women's College World Series but It's been a great ride."" ### But it hadn't always been an easy one. ### Tennessee outfielder Haley Bearden (11) is congratulated my teammates on her homer during a Lady Vols softball game against Arkansas at Sherri Parker Lee stadium on University of Tennessee's campus in Knoxville Sunday, March 24, 2019. The Lady Vols defeated Arkansas. ### (Photo: Caitie McMekin/News Sentinel) ### Bearden's breakout season, this spring, resulted in a .313 batting average, 30 runs and 50 hits while leading the Lady Vols in home runs (15) and RBIs (47). ### Those numbers are a far cry from not registering a batting average as a freshman in 2016, batting only .119 as a junior last year and failing to have a season with double digits in runs or RBIs for the first three years of her career. ### It helps when your at-bats skyrocket from three as a freshman to 59 as a junior and 160 this spring. ### ""I was a pinch-hitter for the majority of time,"" Bearden explained. ""It's hard to get a hit, period. But then when you're limited in the number of chances you get to hit, it's even tougher."" ### There were a few crossroads that Bearden faced, like whether she wanted to continue playing softball. ### ""Anytime she felt that way she would look at the photos in her room of Donny and say to herself, 'I have to keep going because I have that choice and Donny doesn't,'"" said Haley's mother, Shelley Bearden. ""The thought of him and not letting him down, i think sort of kept her going."" ### Clarksville High’s Haley Bearden runs to first base during the Region 5-AAA championship against Dickson County two years ago. Bearden was the lone Montgomery County representative named to the TSWA’s All State softball team. ### (Photo: The Leaf-Chronicle) ### Bearden's final season was, in part, a dedication to Everett's memory. ### ""I think that's part of the reason why she was able to place it all in the proper perspective this year,"" her mom said. ""We had a talk during Christmas and she told me that she was ready to love the game again."" ### Bearden walked on to UT's campus in the fall of 2015 as a heralded high school standout at Clarksville, earning all-state honors as a catcher during her sophomore, junior and senior seasons with the Lady Wildcats. ### But Bearden also walked on to UT's campus as a freshman with a torn labrum. Once Bearden had the shoulder scoped, doctors found it to be more damaged than previously thought. ### It's part of the story of her freshman year at UT for a player who hit .464 with 19 home runs and 73 RBIs as a junior at Clarksville and followed that with a .426 average and 49 RBIs as a senior. ### NEWSLETTERS ### More newsletters ### ""Like any kid going to big school to play ball you put a lot of pressure on yourself,"" CHS softball coach Brian Rush said. ""Haley did that to some degree. But she's always been a fighter. She's going to figure things out."" ### Bearden allowed herself to have fun again and it showed immediately. ### Haley Bearden had a career-high three RBIs in Tennessee's 8-4 win over Texas A&M on Saturday in College Station, Texas ### (Photo: Craig Bisacre/Tennessee Athletics) ### The Lady Vols finished the season 43-17 and 14-10 in the SEC — tied for second with Kentucky and LSU. Her ninth-inning bases-loaded walk in the second game of the super regional against Florida last Saturday scored the winning run. ### Bearden's last college at-bat — a seventh-inning, game-tying solo home run — landed two feet from where her father, Gavin, was standing in the outfield stands. ### It was the way Bearden wanted to end it. ### And now with her college career over, Bearden plans to enroll in graduate school at Tennessee and to give back to the softball community in Clarksville. ### ""I'll give some lessons and try to put a camp together,"" Bearden said. ""Maybe I'll coach at some point. I don't know. I know I love teaching the game. It's given me so much.""

Pictured is the nuclear plant this year. | [Courtesy of Duke Energy Florida] ### Published 3 hours ago ### Updated 3 hours ago ### CRYSTAL RIVER — Duke Energy Florida will ask regulators for permission to speed up its Crystal River nuclear plant decommissioning, the utility announced Thursday. Instead of being dismantled by 2074, the plant will now be fully decommissioned by 2027. It has not produced power since 2009. ### The primary driver for the shorter timetable was cost, said Duke spokeswoman Heather Danenhower. When the shutdown was announced in 2013, decommissioning was too costly to do quickly. But the utility finalized a contract with Accelerated Decommissioning Partners on Wednesday, locking the cost of the entire process in at $540 million. That will be covered by Duke's $717 million decommissioning trust for the plant, which was funded by ratepayers between 1977 and 2001. ### Customers will not see an increase on their monthly bills for the process. ### ""It gives us a crystal ball into the future of the nuclear plant decommission,"" Danenhower said. ""We know what that cost is today, and we are going to do the work in the next decade instead of waiting."" ### The plant was shut down because of a botched do-it-yourself repair by Duke's predecessor, Progress Energy, in which the utility cracked the 42-inch-thick concrete building where the reactor was housed. ### Decommissioning the nuclear plant was originally thought to cost around $1.18 billion . Customers were not expected to shoulder that cost, but consumer advocates warned that the figure could go up during the decommissioning process as unexpected expenses cropped up. ### The approval process, Danenhower said, is expected to take about a year. The plant itself will be torn down in 2026 or 2027, and the only thing that will remain is the portion of the plant housing the spent nuclear material, which is known as ""dry cask storage."" Under the agreement, it will be owned by Accelerated Decommissioning Partners and sent to the Department of Energy at a future date when there is a more permanent place for it. There currently isn't a central national repository for used nuclear fuel. ### “Selling the dry cask storage assets allows Duke Energy to transfer all aspects of used fuel management, including operating and maintenance costs, to us,” Scott State, CEO of Accelerated Decommissioning Partners, said in a release. “Owning the dry cask storage system assets closely aligns with our industry expertise and business strategy.” ### Duke, Danenhower said, expects to use the newly vacant area for other purposes after 2027, though it hasn't settled on what yet. It does not plan to sell the land. ### Along with the nuclear plant being torn down, Duke will also dismantle two retired coal-powered generators at the site, which were put out of service at the end of 2018 when the utility's new natural gas plant came online . That process is expected to begin this year and finish by 2023. ### Contact Malena Carollo at [email protected] or (727) 892-2249.

Below: Plastic takeout containers are mixed with the rubbish at a garbage station. ### Photo: Photos By Na Zhou / New York Times ### Photo: Photos By Na Zhou / New York Times ### Image 1 of / 4 ### Close ### Image 1 of 4 ### At rush hour, delivery services save time by leaving takeout orders in the lobbies of office buildings, like this one in Beijing. Below: Plastic takeout containers are mixed with the rubbish at a garbage station. ### Photo: Photos By Na Zhou / New York Times ### Food delivery apps are drowning China in plastic ### 1  /  4 ### Back to Gallery ### BEIJING — In all likelihood, the enduring physical legacy of China’s internet boom will not be the glass-and-steel office complexes or the fancy apartments for tech elites. ### It will be the plastic. ### The astronomical growth of food delivery apps in China is flooding the country with takeout containers, utensils and bags. And the country’s patchy recycling system isn’t keeping up. The vast majority of this plastic ends up discarded, buried or burned with the rest of the trash, researchers and recyclers say. ### Scientists estimate that the online takeout business in China was responsible for 1.6 million tons of packaging waste in 2017, a ninefold jump from two years before. That includes 1.2 million tons of plastic containers, 175,000 tons of disposable chopsticks, 164,000 tons of plastic bags and 44,000 tons of plastic spoons. ### Put together, it is more than the amount of residential and commercial trash of all kinds disposed of each year by the city of Philadelphia. The total for 2018 grew to an estimated 2 million tons. ### People in China still generate less plastic waste, per capita, than Americans. But researchers estimate that nearly three-quarters of China’s plastic waste ends up in inadequately managed landfills or out in the open, where it can easily make its way into the sea. More plastic enters the world’s oceans from China than from any other country. Plastic can take centuries to break down undersea. ### Recyclers manage to return some of China’s plastic trash into usable form to feed the nation’s factories. The country recycles around a quarter of its plastic, government statistics show, compared with less than 10% in the United States. ### But in China, takeout boxes do not end up recycled, by and large. They must be washed first. They weigh so little that scavengers must gather a huge number to amass enough to sell to recyclers. ### “Half a day’s work for just a few pennies. It isn’t worth it,” said Ren Yong, 40, a garbage collector at a downtown Shanghai office building. He said he threw takeout containers out. ### For many overworked or merely lazy people in urban China, the leading takeout services Meituan and Ele.me are replacing cooking or eating out as the preferred means of obtaining nourishment. Delivery is so cheap, and the apps offer such generous discounts, that it is now possible to believe that ordering a single cup of coffee for delivery is a sane, reasonable thing to do. ### Yuan Ruqian knows that it is not. Yet she, too, has succumbed. ### Like the time she was craving ice cream, but a newly opened Dippin’ Dots store seemed so far away. Or when she orders delivery for lunch, which is nearly every day. ### Asked about the trash she generates, Yuan, 27, who works in finance in Shanghai, said: “Laziness is the root of all evil.” ### The transformation of daily life has been swift. Meituan says it delivered 6.4 billion food orders last year, a nearly 60% jump from 2017. Those orders were worth $42 billion in total, meaning the average order was $6.50 — about enough for a decent meal for one in a big Chinese city. ### Ele.me — the name means “Are you hungry?” and is pronounced “UH-luh-muh” — has not disclosed similar figures. But across China’s major takeout apps, orders worth a combined $70 billion were delivered in 2018, according to the analysis firm iResearch. ### By comparison, online food delivery sales in the United States are expected to total $19 billion this year, according to Statista. Uber says its Uber Eats service generated $7.9 billion in orders worldwide last year. GrubHub reported $5.1 billion in food sales and 159 million orders in 2018, implying an average order value of $32. ### Around the world, the convenience of such services comes with costs that can be easy to overlook. Labor controversies, for instance. Or roads made more hazardous by takeout couriers zooming around on motorbikes. Plastic waste is just as easily ignored, even when it is being generated and mismanaged on a titanic scale. ### China is home to a quarter of all plastic waste that is dumped out in the open. Scientists estimate that the Yangtze River emptied 367,000 tons of plastic debris into the sea in 2015, more than any other river in the world, and twice the amount carried by the Ganges in India and Bangladesh. The world’s third and fourth most polluting rivers are also in China. ### Takeout apps may be indirectly encouraging restaurants to use more plastic. Restaurants in China that do business through Meituan and Ele.me say they are so dependent on customer ratings that they would rather use heavier containers, or sheathe an order in an extra layer of plastic wrap, than risk a bad review because of a spill. ### “Meituan is deeply committed to reducing the environmental impact of food delivery,” the company said in a statement, pointing to initiatives such as allowing users to choose not to receive disposable tableware. ### The e-commerce titan Alibaba, which owns Ele.me, declined to comment. ### This deluge of trash might not be such a big problem were China not in the middle of a monumental, if flawed, effort to fix its recycling system. Recycling has long been a gritty, unregulated affair in the country, one driven less by green virtue than by the business opportunity in extracting value out of other people’s leavings. ### The government now wants a recycling industry that doesn’t spoil the environment or sicken workers. The transition hasn’t been smooth. ### China recently banned many types of scrap from being imported into the country, hoping that recyclers would focus on processing domestic material instead. That killed off a lucrative business for those recyclers, and left U.S. cities scrambling to find new dumping grounds for their cardboard and plastic. Some cities have been forced to end their recycling programs. ### Other policies may inadvertently be causing fewer recyclables to be collected from China’s homes and offices. In Beijing, many scavengers who do this work have fallen victim to an aggressive government campaign to “improve the quality of the city’s population,” a euphemism for driving out migrant workers from the countryside. ### To clean up the filthy air in Beijing, the government has also clamped down on “small, scattered polluting enterprises” in the capital region. Inspectors have since closed down hundreds of dingy backyard workshops that cleaned and processed plastic scrap. ### Not everyone mourns the loss. For years, Mao Da, an environmental researcher, has studied the plastic industry in Wen’an County, near Beijing. Workers there used to sort through food and medical waste by hand, he said. Nonrecyclable material was buried in pits near farmland. ### “It was an environmental and public health catastrophe,” Mao said. ### So far, though, the crackdown hasn’t caused large, professionally managed recycling companies to fill the void. Instead, it has left the entire business in limbo. ### “You’ve got fewer people collecting scrap, fewer people transporting it and fewer people processing it,” said Chen Liwen, the founder of Zero-Waste Villages, a nonprofit that promotes recycling in rural China. “The overall recycling rate has definitely fallen.” ### Raymond Zhong and Carolyn Zhang are New York Times writers. ### Most Popular",060119,1,"“ You’ve got fewer people collecting scrap, fewer people transporting it and fewer people processing it,” said Chen Liwen, the founder of Zero-Waste Villages, a nonprofit that promotes recycling in rural China. “ The overall recycling rate has definitely fallen. ”###Raymond Zhong and Carolyn Zhang are New York Times writers.###Most Popular","[98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104]","<p>“ You’ve got fewer people collecting scrap, fewer people transporting it and fewer people processing it,” said Chen Liwen, the founder of Zero-Waste Villages, a nonprofit that promotes recycling in rural China. “ The overall recycling rate has definitely fallen. ”</p><p>Raymond Zhong and Carolyn Zhang are New York Times writers.</p><p>Most Popular</p>"

64516,"SHARE ### COPY LINK ### Koy and Daniel Saeteurn wrote a “love letter” to the seller of their new home in Elk Grove. Home seller Waleska Banegas describes how the letter resonated with her on Wednesday, May 29, 2019. By ### Home buying season is in full throttle . And despite high prices, that often means multiple offers on popular houses in Sacramento and around California. What’s a buyer to do to stand out? ### Write a “love letter,” experts now say. ### Sacramento real estate agents say they increasingly are advising clients to write personal, heartfelt notes telling sellers about themselves, and notably what they love about their house. ### “It will resonate with the sellers’ emotions,” said Realtor Erin Stumpf of Coldwell Banker. “If the seller can identify with why you like the house, they will pick your offer.” ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to The Sacramento Bee content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### It’s hardly a guarantee, though. A house sale is primarily a financial transaction, marketers said. Dollars speak louder than words. ### “Most home sellers aren’t looking to walk away from the transaction (with) less money than they could otherwise get, along with a consolation prize like a nice letter or gift basket,” bankrate.com economist Mark Hamrick says. “The financial qualifications of buyers or bidders is most important, particularly in situations where there are multiple prospective buyers.” ### But a not-so-hidden reality about home sales transactions is that they can be emotional events. Sellers are saying goodbye to a place that has helped define their lives. Perhaps they raised their family there. Some may accept a lower bid from a family rather than sell to an investor who’s going to rent it out or a flipper who’s going to rip out the rugs, redo the floors and immediately resell. ### A small thing can turn the trick, agent Sue Olson said. A client of hers recently got a house after sending a letter with a family picture that included their golden retriever. It turns out the seller had a golden retriever too. ### Koy Saeteurn, 28, and her husband Daniel Saechao, 29, recently beat out 12 other bidders for a starter home in Elk Grove, thanks to a note they wrote about growing up as first-generation Americans and about their plans to start a family in the home. They included photos of their wedding day. ### “We can tell that your home holds many memories of raising young children,” they wrote, “many family dinners cooked in your cozy kitchen and evenings spent enjoying barbeques in your beautiful back yard. ### “These are things we can imagine as we walked through this home as an embodiment of our American dream. We would love the opportunity to continue to cherish this home as much as you have.” ### Homeowner Waleska Banegas says she received seven letters from prospective buyers. She and her agent Dan Massey of Lyon Real Estate spent hours going through the offers. She chose Saeteurn and Saechao because they reminded her of her younger self. Like them, she is from an immigrant family, raised in the Central Valley. And, like Saeteurn, she is a University of California, Davis, grad. ### “I could relate to them on so many levels,” Banegas said. She raised two daughters in the home. “I would really want for them to have a family in my home, because that is what I did.” ### Personal notes are not new. But agents say they have become more common in Sacramento in recent years as the market got hot, putting sellers in the driver’s seat and pushing buyers to find ways to distinguish themselves. ### Now, some agents say they will tell their clients to write personal letters even if their offer is the only one on a house. That way, when it gets down to negotiating who pays for required repairs, it’s less likely to become adversarial and the deal is less likely to fall apart, Stephanie Gallagher of Dunnigan Realtors said. ### “You’re more likely to (decide) let’s not nickel and dime them,” she said. When Gallagher submits a bid, she places her client’s personal letter on top of the document pile so the seller sees it even before getting to the offer sheet. ### Now that many bidders write letters, it can sometimes become a writing competition, with some homework thrown in, agents say. Gallagher keeps a file of winning letters to show to new clients. She also will research the seller and advise her client on ways they can connect with the seller. She will edit, correct grammar and even print letters in the font that seems best for the moment. ### She’s currently representing a seller, though, who is unsentimental and wants the best price possible. Gallagher has warned other real estate agents not to come in with letters that are too syrupy. “It might work against you,” she said. ### Kim Squaglia of Tim Collom Realtor Group said she also reviews client’s letters and guides the client if she knows particular things about the seller. ### She recently encouraged a successful bidder to mention the non-profit agency the buyer worked for because she had some clues the seller would identify with that group. She will tell a nurse, firefighter or teacher to let buyers know what their occupation is. Conversely, she said, she might counsel an attorney not to mention that occupation if she thinks a skittish seller might be worried about a lawsuit. ### But, she said, it comes down to the sincerity of the client. ### “I tell them to write from their heart, and always compliment the property,” she said. “And be honest.”",060119,1,"Koy and Daniel Saeteurn wrote a “love letter” to the seller of their new home in Elk Grove.

Some tablets are thinner and lighter than others, however. While we've praised tablets like the iPad 2 and Galaxy Tab 10.1 for their sleekness and dinged the HP TouchPad for being too bulky, the Thrive poses an interesting question. Is a bulky tablet inherently a bad thing or can a tablet justify its extra mass? ### Design ### While most other tablets, like the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 , show efforts to emulate Apple's thin, light, and minimalist iPad 2 design, Toshiba hurls the Thrive right into the soft, supple face of the notion that tablets should be designed this way. Sure, at 1.66 pounds the Thrive is relatively light compared with, say, a laptop or even a Netbook, but at that weight, it's as heavy as the heaviest tablet we've seen and its 0.63-inch depth makes it nearly twice as thick as either the Galaxy Tab 10.1 or the iPad 2. ### Toshiba Thrive ### 0.9 ### 0.85 ### Toshiba's intent with the Thrive was to make a tablet that more closely met the needs of a typical laptop user, and as you can see from the specs above, the Toshiba Thrive is one of the heaviest, widest, and deepest tablets we've yet seen. As Honeycomb tablets go, it's very much the anti-Galaxy Tab 10.1. While the Galaxy Tab 10.1 is all smooth, sleek, sexy, and devoid of ports, the Thrive is anything but, and its measurements only tell half the story. ### The Toshiba Thrive compared with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. We told you it was thick. ### Upon picking up the Thrive, the first thing we noticed was its grooved back panel, which provides an easy-to-grip texture. While our model's panel was black, the panel is removable and can be swapped out for a panel in one of five other colors (green, purple, blue, pink, and silver), available for $20 each. Removing the panel requires that you dig your fingernails into the speaker indentations and then carefully, but firmly, pull back. Given the manner in which the panel is connected to the tablet, when pulling it off you may get the impression that you're breaking something, and although we didn't break anything, we can't rule out the possibility and we wish the panel came off more easily. ### Once the panel is off, the removable battery can be accessed, removed, and finally swapped with an extra battery Toshiba has priced at $80. The battery measures 5.1x5.5 inches, with about a 0.25-inch depth. Removing the battery is simpler and easier than removing the back panel, although replacing both battery and panel is easy. There's also the option to lock the back panel into place, which seems unnecessary since it's pretty firmly attached once placed properly, and if locked and forgotten could easily cause someone to break it by trying to pull the panel off while it's in a locked state. ### The back panel is removable and swappable with up to five other colors. The battery is revealed here. It's the large light gray plate on the left. ### When held in landscape mode, the top of the tablet holds, from left to right, the power button, volume rocker, and rotation lock. Both the volume rocker and rotation lock are easily accessed, but the power button is embedded a tad too deeply and requires a more focused press to actually click. It's nowhere near as bad as the BlackBerry PlayBook's, which requires a pen to access properly, though. ### On the opposite end of the top edge is the full-size SD card slot, which accepts cards of up to 128GB in capacity. Near the power button, on the bezel, are three LED indicator lights that glow to indicate when the power is on, when the battery's charging, or when wireless or Bluetooth is switched on. While you'd likely get used to the lights after a while, they're not typical of the tablet experience and can be distracting if you're looking for a completely clean interface. ### On the bottom right side are the power and headphone jacks. Above them is a 3-inch-long door, concealing the full USB port, full HDMI port, and Mini-USB port. On each of the far sides of the bottom edge sit 1-inch-long speakers. In the middle of the bottom edge is a dock connector port. ### The cameras are located on either side on the bezel in the middle of the tablet's left side. We found that when holding the Thrive in landscape mode, our fingers naturally blocked the rear lens. And while it's easy enough to move your finger down and out of the way, it's also less comfortable to hold it like that, especially given the tablet's heavier-than-average weight. ### We think the Thrive's rear camera is ill-placed as evidenced by the fact that our fingers covered it virtually every time we turned it on. ### Overall, the device feels solid and durable, and we found it comfortable to hold, if slightly bulky. Also, the edge where the back panel meets the end of the bezel feels a little sharp and was distracting when our fingers rubbed it. ### Features ### Under the hood, the Toshiba Thrive houses a 1GHz dual-core Nvidia Tegra 2 processor with a 10.1-inch capacitive touch screen and a 1,280x800-pixel resolution. All the usual tablet bell and whistles are here, including a gyroscope, accelerometer, ambient light sensor, GPS, and digital compass.",060119,1,News###Topics###Video###Categories###How To###Topics,"[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]",<p>News</p><p>Topics</p><p>Video</p><p>Categories</p><p>How To</p><p>Topics</p>

At training, the batting coach, Graham Thorpe, said: “It’s been a good ground to play at over the years and it has generally always been a good pitch, so we are looking forward to it. If we get into a good position, we’ll try to score as many as we can. But if it doesn’t happen, you’ve got to put a competitive score on the board to put the opposition under pressure.” ### A lot of pre-tournament chat surrounded the possibility of the 500 barrier being broken, with Trent Bridge seen as a likely venue. But Pakistan’s blow-out against West Indies there on Friday , at the start of the tournament that has bowlers slightly on top, serves as a reminder there are no givens. ### Pace and bounce did for Safraraz Ahmed’s side when – two pitches across from Monday’s match – they were bowled out for 105 in 21.4 overs. England are now considering a return for Mark Wood to add a second 90mph man alongside Jofra Archer. ### Thorpe said: “West Indies bowled very well, they looked like they roughed Pakistan up as well. It was interesting viewing. [Archer and Wood] will be discussed. The captain will probably make a call on it. I am sure he will think about it with Trevor Bayliss and a couple of senior players and then come up with a plan.” ### Caution over Wood’s fitness led to Liam Plunkett being preferred for the win over South Africa and the 34-year-old typically delivered in the second powerplay, following up Archer’s initial incisions with figures of for 37 from seven overs, including the wicket of Quinton de Kock, South Africa’s top scorer. ### The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. ### Chris Woakes is expected be rotated during the tournament as he manages a long-standing knee problem and so could also be a candidate to make way.

(AP) — Dan Marr will never forget the first time Jack Hughes landed on his radar as a potential top NHL draft prospect. ### It happened last summer, when the NHL Central Scouting director was attending a skills camp in Toronto. ### After listing New Jersey's Taylor Hall, Edmonton's Connor McDavid and then-Islanders captain John Tavares as the best three players on the ice, Marr added: ""The next best player was Jack Hughes."" ### Even at 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds, Marr said the 17-year-old stood out for a variety of reasons. ### ""It was a series of drills that they were doing that involved skating, quickness, speed, execution, precision. And right away you could see he already has an NHL shot,"" Marr said Friday, speaking at the NHL's annual pre-draft scouting combine being held in Buffalo. ""So he's got the talent that he belongs in that group."" ### Very little has happened to change Marr or anyone else's mind since. ### From Orlando, Florida, Hughes is Central Scouting's top-ranked North American skater after spending the past two seasons setting USA Hockey National Team Development Program's record by combining for 228 points (74 goals, 154 assists) in 110 games. ### Finland's Kaapo Kakko is the top-ranked European skater after completing a season in which he helped his nation complete a gold-medal sweep of international titles by winning the world championship last weekend, the world junior title in January and the Under-18 title last year. ### The two are projected to be selected with one of the two top picks — the Devils select first followed by the New York Rangers — at the NHL draft at Vancouver, British Columbia on June 21-22. ### After joking he'd look good in either a red Devils' or blue Rangers' jersey, Hughes said he'd obviously prefer to go first. ### ""You always dream of being No. 1,"" Hughes said. ""You don't dream of being two, three or four when you're a young kid."" ### Hughes is also aware of how he and Kakko will draw comparisons with the likelihood of the two playing on Metropolitan Division rivals. ### ""We'll be linked to each other for a lot of years with the Rangers and Devils right there,"" Hughes said. ### Kakko is not attending the combine because the weeklong event, which includes player-team interviews and medical testing, began a day after Finland beat Canada to win the world championships in Slovakia on Sunday. ### ""It has zero affect really,"" Marr said about Kakko's absence. ""I think the teams understand that. And the teams at the top, they're just going to have to spend a little bit more time with him when he comes over for the draft."" ### The two players differ in size and style of play. ### At 6-foot-2 and 194 pounds, Kakko is known for his goal-scoring ability and considered more of a power forward. ### He led Finland with six goals in 10 games at the World Championship. His 22 goals in the Finnish Elite League last season were the most by a draft-eligible player. ### Hughes is a swift-skating, play-making center. He comes from a hockey family. His brother Quinn Hughes is a defenseman who was selected by Vancouver with the No. 7 pick in the draft last year. His father, Jim Hughes, is a former hockey coach, who also served as the Toronto Maple Leafs director of player development. ### Hughes credits the time he spend playing youth hockey in Toronto as playing a key role in his development. ### ""Toronto's probably the capital of the hockey world. You win the Greater Toronto Hockey League finals, you think it's the Stanley Cup,"" he said. ""Do I think I'd be the player I am today without Toronto? Probably not. ... That's the reason I'm here today."" ### Hughes also played at the worlds and finished with four assists in four games for the United States, which was eliminated by Russia in the quarterfinal round. ### Among the highlights was getting the opportunity to play with NHL stars such as Chicago's Patrick Kane. ### Hughes grew up idolizing Kane as they're both under-sized forwards who play a similar style. ### It came as a shock to Hughes upon hearing Kane pay him a compliment by telling NHL.com he believes Hughes ""does a lot of things better than me."" ### ""You almost think he's full of (baloney),"" Hughes said, before listing the three Stanley Cups and numerous other awards Kane has won. ""You name it, he's got it. To hear your name out of his mouth is one thing. To hear him say those nice things about you truly shows how good of a person he is.""

11244,"Eagles' first male cheerleaders drew boos ### Follow Us ### Was Mueller nudging Congress to impeach Trump ### Question of the Day ### Print ### By FRANK FITZPATRICK and The Philadelphia Inquirer -         Associated Press  -                                                                         Saturday, June 1, 2019 ### PHILADELPHIA (AP) - It was late in a listless Eagles exhibition game on the cool and cloudy night of Aug. 23, 1984. In Veterans Stadium’s notorious 700 Level, the blood-alcohol level was as elevated as the vantage point. ### The home team, 5-11 the previous year, was displaying little improvement. Rowdy and restless, fans booed lustily after Philadelphia rookie Evan Cooper’s fumble, after two Ron Jaworski interceptions, after backup QB Joe Pisarcik was sacked twice. ### So when the giant PhanaVision screen suddenly flashed the image of two men in skimpy shorts and sleeveless, satin T-shirts, the crowd’s reaction was as predictable as the 6-9-1 Eagles season that was to follow. ### “There was even something new to boo this year,” The Inquirer’s Jere Longman noted in his story on the Eagles’ 20-19 victory over the Browns, “male cheerleaders.” ### Time, attitudes, and stadiums have changed. When the Eagles open their 2019 season, the debut of Kyle Tanguay, their first male cheerleader since then, figures to pass with little note. ### But 35 years ago, that first bracing glimpse of Paul Kramer and Mark Merschen , who that year joined 30 female counterparts on the Eagles’ Liberty Belles, drew a decidedly negative response. ### “I think it was an idea before its time,” Merschen said recently. ### Other NFL teams had employed male cheerleaders. The Eagles weren’t trying to foster social change when they did so and, according to some accounts, were so shaken by the Vet reception that they briefly considered shelving the experiment. ### Whatever triggered the crowd’s reaction, it was soon forgotten, and Kramer and Merschen - with a significant uniform adjustment - endured the entire 1984 season, performing at all eight regular-season home games and at public and charitable events throughout the area. ### A year later, Norman Braman bought the team from Leonard Tose. The Eagles’ cheerleading program was revamped, and Kramer and Merschen faded away. ### Kramer moved to New York City, where he taught in the public school system for many years. He died at 57 in 2012. Merschen was a professional roller skater when he tried out on a whim. He is 59 and single and works at Philadelphia International Airport as a fleet-service agent for American Airlines. ### Their role in franchise history was nearly forgotten until the Eagles’ May 1 hiring of Tanguay. When Kramer ’s sister heard the news, she was annoyed that the Eagles had labeled the University of the Arts dance major their first male cheerleader. ### “I reached out to the Eagles, to media relations and the cheerleaders,” Terri Kramer-Mebert said. “Nobody contacted me. Finally, I sent Kyle a message about my brother.” ### Kramer grew up in Wallingford, one of five children of a Westinghouse engineer and his teacher wife. He would go on to earn a master’s in education from Fordham, but at the time was working with special-needs children in a Delaware County day care that his mother started. In the spring of 1984, on a dare, he responded to an ad about an Eagles cheerleader tryout. ### “He loved to dance,” Kramer-Mebert recalled. “We all took dance classes growing up. When we were clearing out my parents’ house, we found all these old top hats and tap shoes. Anyway, he made the first cut and he got excited about it, so he continued. It was tough, but he eventually got picked.” ### That same spring, Merschen , of Maple Glen, happened to be at JFK Stadium preparing for a roller-skating show. When rain postponed it, he and a fellow performer decided to walk across Pattison Avenue to the Vet, where they knew the Eagles were auditioning cheerleaders. ### “There was a woman in charge, and I asked her if it was open to guys,” Merschen said. “She said, ‘Sure, why not?’ So we just did some of our skating routines without skates. My friend, Tony, got cut, but I made it.” ### Initially, a few of the Belles were cool to their new male teammates but very soon, according to Sharon Sweeney, then their choreographer, “all the girls loved them.” ### Unlike the women, Kramer and Merschen didn’t have to carry pom-poms. And once they got past their trying debut, they abandoned the shorts - basically the same as the women were wearing - and donned Kelly green sweatpants. ### “But those two guys did everything that the girls did,” recalled Sweeney, who operates an Irish-themed gift shop in Phoenixville. “They were in the Thanksgiving Parade with us. They were at all the games and went to the softball games and supermarket openings.” ### Neither Merschen nor Sweeney remembers much booing at their debut, but there apparently was enough to make the Eagles reconsider their decision. ### “These guys are great,” Sherry Lewis, the Eagles’ cheerleading administrator, told the Daily News a few days later. “But if the reaction is more negative than positive, then that will be that.” ### Kramer-Mebert was at the game and hasn’t forgotten the reaction of the preseason crowd of 40,030 to the two men. ### “There were a lot of jeers,” she said. “The people sitting behind me were carrying on and calling them names. After a while, I couldn’t take it anymore and I stood up and said, ‘That’s my brother.’ I was proud of him. I stared at them all and sat down. Later, I turned around and they were gone. ### “Later, I asked Paul how it felt to hear all those comments and the boos,” she said. “I remember he said, ‘I can handle it because when we leave that stadium at night, what the girls have to hear from the people standing at the entrance is 10 times worse.’ ### “He was very proud of being an Eagles cheerleader. He crossed a barrier.” ### ___",060119,1,"A year later, Norman Braman bought the team from Leonard Tose.

I would change the dynamics; I would change the paradigm of this campaign by focusing on the developmental issues that will make the people realize their collective aspirations.” ### Alhaji Abdul-Wahab Alhassan made these statements in an exclusive interview when he organized Iftar party for NPP Electoral Area Coordinators in the Sagnarigu constituency to familiarize with the people and inform them of his intension to contest the upcoming parliamentary primaries of the party in the constituency. ### He further explained that, the people socioeconomic and infrastructure development needs are among his top most priorities. He observed that, for far too long, the inhabitants have been deprived of basic social amenities, job opportunities and access to quality education, this he blamed squarely on the poor leadership of the incumbent MP. ### Meanwhile, some residents of Choggu Yapalsi, a suburb of the Sagnarigu constituency last year descended heavily on Alhaji A.B.A Fuseini for failing to ameliorate the plight of the people. They threatened to vote against him if he fails to fulfill his campaign promises, including the construction of major roads in the area. ### Abdallah as he identified himself then said: “Our MP who calls himself Tumalana is not deserving of the name, he is telling lies. He only knows how to speak proverbs anytime they are interviewing him or in parliament, we didn’t send him to parliament to be speaking proverbs for us, we want him to work. A.B.A Fuseini has not done developmental thing in Sagnarigu.” ### Undoubtedly, Dr Wahab is believed to be the game-changer among the few people who have already appeared in the scene to contest the Sagnarigu seat on the ticket of the governing New Patriotic Party.

CASSIDY Associated Press ### Jun 1, 2019 ### Save ### ATLANTA (AP) — New York voters for years have experienced some of the longest wait times in the nation on Election Day. Attempts to fix the problem routinely became casualties of the divided politics of the state Legislature. ### That dynamic changed last November, when Democrats won majorities in both legislative chambers, and it didn't take them long to act. ### Just weeks into this year's legislative session, they passed a bill to allow early voting, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo promptly signed it. ### ""Early voting is going to make a significant difference for countless numbers of New Yorkers by making polling places so much more accessible and allow voters to determine when it is most convenient for them,"" said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York. ### New York is among a small number of states where Democrats made big gains in last year's election and have used that power to pass laws to make it easier to register and to vote. They have introduced early voting, all-mail voting or automatic registration. ### A few Republican-led states — some of which saw high turnout for Democratic candidates — are going in the opposite direction, advancing bills to tighten voter registration and early voting. ### ""Some of this seems like a fairly direct response to things that happened in the midterms,"" said Max Feldman, who tracks voting laws at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law. ### In New Mexico, Democrats not only expanded their majority in the state House but also claimed the governor's mansion after eight years of GOP control. By March, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had signed a law to allow people to register and vote on the same day beginning in 2021. Previously, registration ended 28 days before an election. ### Hawaii lawmakers approved legislation replacing the in-person voting system with one made up entirely of mailed ballots. If the measure is signed into law, the state will join Colorado, Oregon and Washington with mail-only voting. Delaware approved in-person, early voting beginning in 2022. ### While bills increasing voter access this year far outnumbered those seeking to impose restrictions, many of the expansion bills were put forward by Democratic lawmakers in states led by Republicans. That means they are unlikely pass. ### In the 2018 elections, Democrats nearly doubled to 14 the number of states in which they control the governor's office and both legislative chambers, but Republicans remain in charge in more states — 22. ### While some voting reforms such as automatic registration have drawn bipartisan support, Republicans generally have opposed same-day registration, mail-only voting and other changes, saying they increase the potential for fraud. ### In Connecticut, Republicans recently thwarted a push by Democrats to do as New York did and add in-person, early voting. Democrats have a legislative majority there, but a constitutional amendment is required to make the change, and they fell short of garnering the votes necessary to put the issue on the ballot. ### Republicans had expressed concern that early voters might come to regret their selections if a race's dynamics shifted after they had turned in their ballot. ### GOP lawmakers in some states also have targeted groups that register voters. They say such groups can create a burden for local election officials if they turn in large numbers of forms that are incomplete or contain false information. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### In Tennessee, Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed a law that allows for fines against groups turning in 100 or more incomplete registration forms in a year. ### ""This bill was presented because of actual circumstances that were meant to confuse the integrity, or to create a lack of integrity, in the voting process,"" Lee said. ### Critics say Tennessee's Republicans feel threatened by an increase in voter participation last year. In 2018, turnout in the state was 51 percent higher than in the previous midterm election. About 259,500 new voters registered in the six months before Election Day. ### ""What politicians should be doing is making sure that local election officials have the adequate resources to do their jobs,"" ACLU attorney Sophia Lakin said in announcing a federal lawsuit challenging the new law. ""Silencing civic groups' voices is not the solution."" ### In Texas, where Democrats picked up two congressional seats last year, lawmakers have been considering a bill that would make it a felony rather than a misdemeanor to knowingly put false information on a voter registration form. It would also increase scrutiny of those who provide transportation for voters headed to the polls. ### The legislation passed the state Senate but stalled in the House. ### Voter-suppression claims also have been made against Republicans in Florida, over a constitutional amendment voters approved last year that would make it easier for convicted felons to regain the right to vote. ### Republican lawmakers, in drafting legislation to implement the amendment, said its language about felons having to complete ""all terms of their sentence including parole or probation"" also meant paying all court fees, fines and restitution before being eligible to vote. ### ""This measure is nothing but a poll tax that would effectively disenfranchise those who are unable to pay,"" Rep. Marcia L. Fudge, an Ohio Democrat, said during a recent congressional hearing in Florida. ### The bill's sponsor, GOP state Sen. Jeff Brandes, defended it, saying: ""Our goal was to follow the constitution, and the constitution is clear — 'all terms of the sentence.'"" ### ———",060119,1,"FILE - In this Thursday, Jan. 31, 2019, file photo, U.S. Rep.

69975,"History's Headlines: Marching to a different beat ### History's Headlines: Marching to a different beat ### By: ### Posted: Jun 01, 2019 06:04 AM EDT ### Updated: Jun 01, 2019 06:04 AM EDT ### 69 News ### 69 News ### Anyone who has ever moved from a home they have lived in a long time can recall how much can accumulate in what seemed a few short years. So, imagine what Allentown Band Music Director Ron Demkee sees when he looks out at the archives of the 190-year-old, 65-member musical organization, which is located in the band's rehearsal space known in Ezra Wenner Hall (named for its oldest member) in Allentown's West End. Not that all the documents are confined to the second floor; downstairs in the space where the band practices are walls filled with letters, photographs, and other memorabilia. Photos of great guest conductors line the walls, including Guiseppe Creatore, a famous Italian conductor of the day who conducted the band in the 1930s. Its date, August 9, 1939, is less than a month before the outbreak of World War II in Europe. The second-floor space is neat and orderly, but limited. Filing cabinets are next to filing cabinets. Band programs from the early 20th century, correspondence from band directors of the past and photographs are all there. According to Demkee, the oldest document is a program from 1853. In short, there is a lot of historically significant ""stuff"" in that room. ### If historians of the future wanted to do an in-depth history on the band, it would take a lot of digging. And of course, even with the most elaborate precautions, fires do happen. That was at least part of the reason why Demkee agreed to an offer by Muhlenberg College Director of Special Collections & Archives Librarian Susan Falciani Maldonado to digitize its collection of records and memorabilia. ""I am a Lehigh Valley native,"" he says, ""I was born in Fullerton, which is now part of Whitehall. I joined the Allentown Band in 1964 when Bert Myers asked me. The history of the region is particularly important to me."" ### As Demkee recalls it the idea was given birth within his presence, although he was not aware of it at the time. The band was playing at a Muhlenberg related dinner concert attended by Maldonado, along with Jim Steffey, former dean of the faculty and John Rosenberg, the son of a Muhlenberg graduate.    In the course of the dinner the concept of digitizing the band's records was suggested. Maldonado, after seeing the band's archives, agreed right away. It would include an interactive website as well as oral history interviews with band members. Funding for the project came from several small grants given to Muhlenberg, including one from the Lehigh Valley Engaged Humanities Consortium, made up of arts and other related organizations. The processing of the collection was supervised by Maldonado. ### Students in the college's Department of Communication and Media (under the department's Dr. Kate Ranieri and Anthony (Tony) Dalton) worked on parts of the project as part of a college course entitled, ""Documentary Fieldwork: In the Field and in the Archives with the Allentown Band."" The actual digitalization was done by ""Backstage Library Works"" in Bethlehem, which has done similar works for the Library of Congress. In a recent interview, members of the team talked of the excitement they felt bringing alive the band's storied past. ""You jump into this stuff and it starts to do something to you… You recognize the responsibility you have to them, the band and its history,"" said one student. Another recalled the help and cooperation they received from friends and relatives of past members: ""One family opened their basement to us and turned over everything they had."" Another student was quoted by the others as calling the collection ""a gem, not just for the Lehigh Valley but the country."" ""When you are working on something like this,"" said Ranieri, ""it sets your mind thinking in all sorts of ways about not just the band but other things, like the history of West Park. It forms other links."" ### Among those gems that was digitized was the correspondence between John Philip Sousa's daughter and the band's legendary director Albertus Meyers. In fact, all of Meyer's correspondence related to the band from 1926 to 1976, is now available. Along with it are scrapbooks and programs. Both students and faculty were impressed with the oral histories and the willingness of band members to share their stories. Asked how in general the band members responded, Debra Heiney, the band's business manager and educational outreach coordinator, notes that some, ""were a little camera shy at first but now have gotten over it and appreciate the history that is being done."" ### Demkee notes that much of the sheet music did not need to be copied. ""In that case there is very little here that could not have been found elsewhere,"" says Demkee. What the band did have was photographs, programs and correspondence that could not be found anywhere else. As Demkee points out, the Allentown Band is a living organization. The ages of their members range from older teenagers to a few in their 90s. He points to Ezra Wenner as an example. ""Ezra came to us in 1942 and has been with us ever since,"" he says. ""He played the trombone for over 70 years."" ### It is this kind of collective wisdom of experience that the senior band members can also pass on to newcomers. Demkee points out, new members come to the band in a variety of ways. ""We have lost 9 members recently from cancer or illness,"" he notes. ""So we did need others to fill the ranks. Sometimes it is musicians who have come to the area who have heard of us. If we have a vacancy, we audition them. After two years they are pretty solidly in the ranks."" Others are young people who are from the area and have taken part in the music programs that both the elementary and high schools offer. ### The Allentown Band's reputation has proceeded it across the country and around the world. Their many recordings have made them popular with band music lovers everywhere. Foreign travel is not unknown to them. Over the last 31 years they have appeared in all 50 states and 24 foreign countries, most recently in Asia. Demkee is particularly pleased that the Allentown Band has been able to work with some of the leaders in international band music composing. One of the most recent was Johan de Meij. A Dutch composer of some note, he and Demkee were working recently on some concepts about Pennsylvania folk songs. The result was what Demkee calls, Pennsylvania faux songs. Composed by de Meij, they are set in eastern Pennsylvania locations. They are five in number: ""On the Banks of the Susquehanna River,"" ""Girl From Allegheny,"" ""The Gettysburg March,"" Punxsutawney Groundhog Waltz"" and ""Allentown Jig."" Last month they were performed at Carnegie Hall and have been performed several times in the Lehigh Valley. ### But for residents of the Lehigh Valley, the Allentown Band is most frequently heard at the iconic West Park band shell that it has made its major venue since the park opened in 1908.  As a concert band they mix a wide variety of numbers at these events. But an Allentown Band concert is somehow never complete without the patriotic airs of John Philip Sousa. So on a summer night when the Allentown Band is playing under the stars you are almost certain to hear its signature finale, Sousa's ""Stars and Striped Forever."" ### All rights reserved.

Thompson had a 69 and was tied with American Jaye Marie Green , South Korea’s Sei Young Kim , So Yeon Ryu and Jeongeun Lee6 (she goes by her unique name after the LPGA Tour of Korea dubbed her 6 because five others have the same name). ### Korda’s younger sister Nelly Korda , second-ranked Minjee Lee of Australia and two-time U.S. Women’s Open champion Inbee Park were among eight players tied at 2 under. ### Thompson had just her third sub-70 showing in 44 career rounds at this tournament. She’s pleased with her position. ### “I’m going to stick with my game plan and what I’ve been working on with my swing and just how I’ve been challenging this golf course with driver and playing it aggressively,” Thompson said. ### Top-ranked Jin Young Ko was six shots behind at even par after her 70. ### Defending champion Ariya Jutanugarn of Thailand shot 73 to make the cut on the number. She is nine shots behind Higa. ### Jennifer Kupcho and Maria Fassi made the cut in their first tournaments as professionals. ### Kupcho, the Wake Forest student who won the inaugural Augusta National Women’s Amateur in April, was at 1 over after finishing her round of 72 Saturday. ### Mexico’s Fassi won the NCAA women’s individual championship last month with Arkansas. She was 3 over after completing her 73. ### The course was far from quiet overnight. Workers removed a large tree between the 18th fairway and 11th green that was struck by lightning during Friday’s weather delay. Crews were cutting and grinding late Friday.

Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. ### Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. ### Rafael Devers homered early for the third-place Red Sox, who fell 8½ games back in the division. That's the furthest they've been behind the Yankees since finishing the 2015 season nine games in the dust. ### PIRATES 9, BREWERS 4 ### PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. ### Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing ""Bellieve"" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. ### Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. ### NEWSLETTERS ### Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. ### REDS 9, NATIONALS 3 ### CINCINNATI (AP) — Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. ### Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. ### Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto's 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. ### Cincinnati's Joey Votto returned after missing three games with a tight right hamstring and had three hits. Eugenio Suarez was back in the lineup after getting hit on the left hand by Clay Holmes' pitch on Wednesday. ### TWINS 5, RAYS 3 ### ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking, two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and Minnesota beat Tampa Bay in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. ### Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. ### José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. ### Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. ### ROCKIES 13, BLUE JAYS 6 ### DENVER (AP) — Trevor Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and the Colorado Rockies beat the slumping Toronto Blue Jays for their sixth straight win. ### It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. ### Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. ### Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. ### ORIOLES 9, GIANTS 5 ### BALTIMORE (AP) — Dwight Smith's first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants. ### Trey Mancini and Renato Núñez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home as the teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. Núñez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. ### Mike Yastrzemski, traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. ### The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. ### Richard Bleier got five outs for his second save. ### WHITE SOX 2, INDIANS 1 ### CHICAGO (AP) — Dylan Covey pitched six effective innings for his first win since August, and the White Sox beat sloppy Cleveland for their season-high fifth straight win. ### Charlie Tilson hit a two-run double to get Chicago's offense rolling. Tilson, Yoán Moncada, Yonder Alonso and Yolmer Sánchez each had two hits. The win moved the White Sox into a second-place tie in the AL Central with Cleveland. ### The Indians committed four errors. Four of Chicago's six runs against slumping Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer were unearned. ### Covey (1-4) settled down after allowing a leadoff homer to Francisco Lindor and scattered eight hits and ended a personal six-game losing streak. Josh Osich and Juan Minaya followed with three innings of one-hit relief. ### Bauer (4-5) allowed nine hits and struck out eight in seven innings, but shaky fielding doomed the right-hander. ### TIGERS 8, BRAVES 2 ### ATLANTA (AP) — Niko Goodrum homered twice and had a career-high five hits, Nicholas Castellanos and Grayson Greiner also went deep, and the Detroit Tigers romped past the Braves. ### Spencer Turnbull (3-4) pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just five hits and one earned run in dealing the Braves their third straight loss at SunTrust Park. ### Goodrum, who came into the night hitting just .208, launched a 419-foot drive that nearly went into the Chop House restaurant above the right-field seats in the third inning. He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. ### After two straight strong starts, Atlanta's Mike Foltynewicz (1-4) had another rough night. Foltynewicz surrendered seven hits and five runs in five innings. ### Atlanta has been outscored 22-6 in its last two defeats. ### RANGERS 6, ROYALS 2 ### ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Joey Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth-inning outburst as the Rangers rallied past the Kansas City Royals. ### Gallo's home run, his team leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet. ### Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. He allowed two runs on five hits and three walks and had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). ### Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks — both in the sixth. ### Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. ### Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Adalberto Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base, giving the Royals a major league-leading 53. ### CARDINALS  2, CUBS 1, 10 INNINGS ### ST. LOUIS (AP) — Matt Carpenter hit a game-ending single against an unusual defensive alignment in the 10th to lead the Cardinals past the Chicago Cubs. ### The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage for May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). They went 8-18 in May 1980. ### Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter, and put four players on the right side of the infield. But Carpenter drove in Wong with a fly ball that found the grass in the left field corner. ### Carlos Martínez pitched a perfect eighth for St. Louis, and Jordan Hicks (2-2) worked two scoreless innings. The last pitch Hicks threw in the ninth registered at 104.3 mph, which is the fastest in baseball this season. ### MARINERS 4, ANGELS 3 ### SEATTLE (AP) — Jay Bruce hit his 300th career home run, Tom Murphy had a two-run shot, and the Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels. ### Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles, achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a dental procedure) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. ### The win snapped the Angels' three-game winning streak and wasted a fairly strong start by the Angels' Tyler Skaggs (4-5), who gave up just five hits but made a handful of costly mistakes while giving up four runs in seven innings. ### The Angels briefly got to Mike Leake (4-6) in the sixth inning when Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani hit back-to-back home runs to left field with two outs. It was the first time Los Angeles has hit consecutive home runs this season, but it wasn't enough for the Angels. ### PADRES 5, MARLINS 2 ### SAN DIEGO (AP) — Franmil Reyes, Hunter Renfroe and Ian Kinsler homered, and left-hander Joey Lucchesi combined with two relievers on a four-hitter for his first victory in six starts to lead the Padres past the Miami Marlins. ### Lucchesi (4-3) hadn't won since beating Cincinnati at home on April 21. He retired his first seven batters before allowing a double by Miguel Rojas in the third. He then retired eight straight before allowing a home run by pinch-hitter Rosell Herrera with one out in the sixth. Lucchesi struck out five and walked one. ### Craig Stammen pitched 1 2/3 hitless innings, Phil Maton allowed two singles to open the Marlins' ninth and Kirby Yates came on to get the final three outs for his 22nd save, best in the majors. ### Herrera was pinch-hitting for lefty Caleb Smith (3-3), who lost his third straight decision after allowing two runs and three hits in five innings. ### DODGERS 6, PHILLIES 3 ### LOS ANGELES (AP) — Max Muncy, Joc Pederson, Corey Seager and Enriquè Hernàndez homered, powering Los Angeles past Philadelphia in the opener of a series matching the National League's best teams. ### The West-leading Dodgers improved to a major league-best 23-7 at home and have won 11 of their last 15 at Chavez Ravine against the East-leading Phillies. The Dodgers' 39 victories lead the NL. Los Angeles rapped out 12 hits while limiting the Phillies to five, including two in the ninth. ### Kenta Maeda (7-2) allowed two runs and three hits in six innings and won his fourth straight start. He struck out six and walked none. Kenley Jansen earned his 17th save. ### Muncy and Seager belted two-run shots and Pederson had a solo homer off Jake Arrieta (5-5), who gave up five runs and 10 hits in five innings, striking out three and walking one. ### Philadelphia's Bryce Harper, Andrew McCutchen and Rhys Hoskins combined to go 2 for 12. McCutchen homered to lead off the fourth. ### ASTROS 3, ATHLETICS 2 ### OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Derek Fisher hit a tiebreaking homer to lead off the eighth inning for his first long ball of the season and the short-handed Houston Astros rallied to beat the Athletics. ### The Astros trailed the A's 2-0 heading into the seventh inning on a night they were missing injured stars Jose Altuvé, Carlos Correa and George Springer. But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A's their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. ### Héctor Rondón (3-1) pitched out of a jam in the seventh with help from a diving stop at shortstop by defensive replacement Jack Mayfield that held Ramón Laureano at third base with the infield drawn in. Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. ### Houston's Josh Reddick snapped an 0-for-15 rut with a solo homer. ### METS 5, DIAMONDBACKS 4 ### PHOENIX (AP) — Carlos Gómez snapped a tie with a pinch-hit double during New York's bizarre two-run eighth inning, sending the Mets past the Arizona Diamondbacks. ### Todd Frazier and Adeiny Hechavarria sparked New York's winning rally with consecutive two-out singles off Matt Andriese (3-4), putting runners on first and third. Pinch hitter J.D. Davis then hit a chopper toward the mound that bounced off Andriese's glove as he reached up. Marte could not handle the ball cleanly as the tying run scored. Gómez followed with a grounder inside the bag at third that drove in Hechavarría, but the ball boy stationed down the line — Arizona uses seniors dubbed ""Golden Glovers"" — fielded the ball thinking it was foul, and Davis was not permitted to score. ### Zack Wheeler (5-3) struck out nine in seven innings, and Robert Gsellman got three outs for his first save. ### Arizona lost its fifth straight game, matching a season high. Christian Walker and Ketel Marte homered for the Diamondbacks. ### ___ ### CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENTEMAILMORE ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Take a look at the 25 most cringeworthy and disappointing films of the comedy genre. ### Worst comedies ever ### When a comedy is truly great, the mere thought of its best scenes can make your sides hurt. The best comedies are fun roller coasters that many end up quoting and re-enacting for years to come. When a comedy falls flat, however, there are few things more cringeworthy and disappointing. ### With this in mind, PrettyFamous, an entertainment site, found the worst comedies of all time. To identify the biggest letdowns, PrettyFamous considered all comedies with more than 50,000 IMDb votes and ranked them on their Smart Rating.

Children's movies were not included, and neither were any movies that are not classified strictly as ""comedies"" (e.g. dark comedies, romantic comedies). ### Note: Plot summaries were sourced (with minor edits) from Gracenote. ### #25.

DeWayne ... more ### Photo: Bill Tiernan, AP ### Did 'silencer' make a difference in Virginia Beach carnage? ### 1  /  3 ### Back to Gallery ### The shooter who killed 12 people in a government office building in Virginia Beach used a firearm equipped with a suppressor that muffles the sound of gunfire. It's the nightmare scenario that gun-control advocates have warned about amid efforts in recent years to ease restrictions on the devices, which they say can help shooters escape detection and inflict more carnage. ### But gun-rights advocates and most law enforcement experts say DeWayne Craddock's use of a suppressor likely had no bearing on his ability to kill so many people in so little time Friday. ### Virginia is among 42 states that allow residents to purchase and possess suppressors, though some cities and towns — including Virginia Beach — prohibit them. ### Known colloquially as a ""silencer,"" a suppressor was attached to the .45-caliber handgun that police say Craddock used to kill a dozen people on three floors of the city building where he worked before police closed in and, after a protracted gunbattle, fatally shot him. ### That could at least partially explain why survivors of the attack said they were caught off guard and initially puzzled by what was happening. One described hearing something that sounded like a nail gun. ### ""This is the concern we were talking about when Republicans were trying to deregulate silencers as 'ear protection,'"" said David Chipman, a retired agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and now the senior policy adviser with Giffords, a gun-control lobbying group. ### ""Especially on a handgun, a suppressor will distort the sound in such a way that it would not immediately be recognizable as gunfire to people who sort of know what that sound is."" ### Others say that Craddock's use of a silencer was less of a factor in enabling him to carry out the rampage than was his familiarity with the building and even possibly his military background, both of which may have given him a tactical advantage. ### ""A suppressor does not alter the lethality of the weapon at all. All it does is just limit the noise it makes,"" said Gregory Shaffer, a retired FBI agent who was a member of the bureau's elite Hostage Response Team. ""It doesn't increase the rate of fire. It doesn't do anything other than make it more comfortable to shoot because it's not so loud."" ### It's not immediately clear how long Friday's attack lasted, or how much time passed before the first police officers arrived. The police department is in the same complex as the building where the shooting took place. ### It also wasn't yet known how Craddock got the suppressor he used on his handgun, though authorities have said he legally purchased multiple firearms recently. ### Authorities have three days to conduct a background check when someone is buying a firearm. But suppressors are regulated by the National Firearms Act, which also governs the sale of machine guns, and the extensive background check can take upward of eight months or more before the sale can go through. ### Despite the barriers, suppressors have gained in popularity. In 2008, when West Valley City, Utah-based SilencerCo was formed, about 18,000 of the devices were being sold each year. The company, which controls an estimated 70 percent of the market, sells roughly that many each month. ### Nicknamed ""cans,"" the devices were invented in the early 1900s by MIT-educated Hiram Percy Maxim, who also invented a muffler for gasoline engines. They were brought under NFA regulations after Depression-era game wardens expressed concern that hunters would use them to poach. ### A suppressor does not eliminate the sound a gun makes but generally diminishes it by 20 to 35 decibels, leaving most guns still louder than your average ambulance siren. ### ""Clearly this was an individual who did understand and have experience with firearms and had given potentially some forethought into the advantage that using a suppressor would offer him, particularly the suppressor coupled with the caliber of weapon he was using,"" said Thor Eells, executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association and a retired law enforcement officer with the Colorado Springs Police Department, where he oversaw a SWAT division. ### Some have questioned how secure the building was where Craddock and all but one of his victims worked. A government facility, the building is open to the public, but security passes are required to enter inner offices, conference rooms and other work areas, officials said. ### As a current employee, Craddock would have had such a pass and would have known the floor plan, areas that were ""easy to control,"" where the best places to hide were and how to move quickly from one area to another, Eells said. ### While responding police might have had some familiarity with the building, it's very possible Craddock knew it a lot better after working there for years. ### His protracted gunfight with law enforcement officers would indicate that he ""was in a place that was difficult for officers to access or engage,"" Eells said. ### ""Whether that was happenstance or intentional, it's too early to tell.""",060119,1,"Back to Gallery###The shooter who killed 12 people in a government office building in Virginia Beach used a firearm equipped with a suppressor that muffles the sound of gunfire.

68013,"Column: Baseball finds itself with a real numbers problem | Hilton Head Island Packet ### Column: Baseball finds itself with a real numbers problem ### By TIM DAHLBERG AP Sports Columnist ### June 01, 2019 02:11 PM ### ORDER REPRINT → ### Fans watch a baseball game between the Miami Marlins and San Francisco Giants, Thursday, May 30, 2019, in Miami. Major League Baseball's average attendance of 26,854 is 1.4% below the 27,242 through the similar point last season, which wound below 30,000 for the first time since 2003. Baltimore, Cincinnati, Minnesota and Tampa Bay set stadium lows this year. Kansas City had its smallest home crowd since 2011, and Toronto and San Francisco since 2010. Miami and the Rays drew 12,653 Wednesday night _ combined. Lynne Sladky AP Photo ### The official culprit last season was the weather, which Major League Baseball cited as a big reason for a 4 percent slide in attendance over the previous year. ### This season? Well, attendance is down once again — only this time there are new excuses. ### Commissioner Rob Manfred blames increased competition for the entertainment dollar, which he says has led to a decline in season ticket sales in some markets. The players' union, meanwhile, says fans simply won't come out to watch bad teams that aren't trying hard enough to get better. ### Take your pick, but here's a third possibility: Baseball is becoming hard to watch, and fans are registering their displeasure by staying home in increasing numbers. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to The Island Packet content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### But first, let's recap MLB's increasingly troublesome turnstile figures. ### Attendance at major league ballparks peaked at an average of 32,785 a game in 2007, not coincidentally at the tail end of baseball's steroid era. It stood at 26,854 through midweek this season, a drop of nearly 6,000 fans a game in 12 years. ### More worrying, perhaps, is that average attendance is down some 3,500 a game since the 2015 season, not coincidentally a time when advanced analytics began changing the way the game is played. ### Yes, that includes the paltry turnouts in Miami and Tampa Bay, where on typical nights there are less — in some cases much less — than 10,000 fans in the ballpark. Baseball has become a tough sell in Florida, as anyone who tunes into a game can readily see. ### But it goes further than that, even in markets that traditionally have supported their teams over the years. ### The Giants sold out every game in San Francisco for nearly seven years running, before the streak of 530 straight was broken in July 2017. It's true the Giants are a shell of the team they were in winning three world championships, but they're down to 32,401 fans this year in a ballpark that holds more than 41,000. ### In Minnesota the early turnouts were so alarming for the best team in baseball that the team began selling $5 tickets just to get people in seats. Still, the Twins are averaging just over 22,000 a game at Target Field, down more than 5,000 from 2015. ### And on a beautiful night in Pittsburgh this week, only 13,059 were motivated enough to come to one of the best ballparks in baseball and watch the Pirates play the Milwaukee Brewers. ### It could be that baseball is just finding its new level after new ballparks and more (steroid aided) home runs helped fuel the attendance boom that peaked in 2007, just before the great recession. Indeed, it might be unrealistic to expect that baseball would average 2.5 million fans a season again across each of its 30 teams. ### Still, 6,585 for an early season game against Oakland in a Baltimore ballpark that once automatically sold out every game? Or, more recently, 8,076 on Thursday night in Tampa Bay for the first place Twins? ### One theory is that baseball is losing its true fans, the ones who appreciate the game and how it unfolds over nine innings. They're increasingly frustrated watching a game that features little strategy, lots of time consuming pitching changes, and more strikeouts than hits. ### They wonder what happened to the stolen base, the sacrifice and the hit-and-run. They're baffled when they see teams playing the shift with the bases loaded in the ninth inning of a tie game with a hitter who doesn't even try to beat it to win a game. ### They're tired of watching everyone swing for the fences with two strikes, and weary of the game being stopped so umpires can gather with headsets to see whether someone's fingers came off a bag for a nanosecond. ### Yes, the casual fans still come for family outings and the experience of a night at the ballpark. Teams like the Cardinals and Dodgers still draw big crowds, and the Phillies with Bryce Harper are packing them in. ### But the trend is unmistakably downward, much like World Series television ratings that are near all-time lows. ### Baseball has a numbers problem in more ways than one.",060119,1,"Yes, that includes the paltry turnouts in Miami and Tampa Bay, where on typical nights there are less — in some cases much less — than 10,000 fans in the ballpark.

The city's visibly shaken mayor, Bobby Dyer, called it ""the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach."" ### The shooting happened shortly after 4 p.m. when the veteran employee of the Public Utilities Department entered a building in the city's Municipal Center, and ""immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all of the victims,"" Cervera said. Authorities did not release the suspect's name, instead choosing to focus on the victims during a news conference. ### Police entered the building and got out as many employees as they could, then exchanged fire with the suspect, who was armed with a .45 caliber handgun, the chief said. ### Police initially said the gunman shot and killed 11 people, including one who was found inside a vehicle outside the municipal building. Cervera later said one more died on the way to the hospital. ### The shooting sent shock waves through Virginia Beach, the state's largest city and a popular vacation spot in southeastern Virginia. The building where the attack took place is in a suburban complex miles away from the high-rise hotels along the beach and the downtown business area. ### Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a statement he was devastated by the ""unspeakable, senseless violence,"" and is offering the state's full support to survivors and relatives of the victims. ### ""That they should be taken in this manner is the worst kind of tragedy,"" the governor said during the news conference. ### The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed and was monitoring the situation. ### Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting happened, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded herself and about 20 colleagues inside an office, pushing a desk against a door. ### ""We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,"" she said. ""We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn't real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots."" ### She texted her mom, telling her that there was an active shooter in the building and she and others were waiting for police. ### ""Thank God my baby is OK,"" Banton's mother, Dana Showers, said. ### At a nearby middle school, friends and relatives were reuniting with loved ones who were in the building when the shooting happened. They included Paul Swain, 50, who said he saw his fiancee from across the parking lot, clearly in an agitated state. ### ""I think she knew some of the people,"" he said. ### Outside the school, Cheryl Benn, 65, waited while her husband, David, a traffic engineer with the city who was in the building where the shooting happened, gave a written statement to detectives. ### She said her husband initially called her from a barricaded room and said it sounded as if someone had been working with a nail gun. Then he saw the bodies. ### ""This is unbelievable for Virginia Beach,"" Cheryl Benn said. ""By and large, it's a pretty calm and peaceful place to live."" ### ——— ### Associated Press writers Regina Garcia Cano in Washington, D.C.; Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia; and Tom Foreman Jr. in Charlotte, North Carolina, contributed to this report. ### 0 Shares",060119,1,"Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting happened, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded herself and about 20 colleagues inside an office, pushing a desk against a door.###"" We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,"" she said.

Andrew Medichini AP Photo ### MIERCUREA CIUC, Romania ### Pope Francis braved a rain-soaked, twisting drive through the mountains of Transylvania on Saturday to visit Romania's most famous shrine, urging Romanian and ethnic Hungarian faithful to work together for their future. ### Storms forced Francis to change his travel plans and add in a three-hour car ride through the Carpathian mountains that he had planned to traverse via helicopter. The steady rains doused the estimated 80,000-100,000 people who gathered for the Mass at the Sumuleu Ciuc shrine, which is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. ### The showers let up as Francis arrived and he made a quick run through the poncho-clad crowds in his popemobile. But the 82-year-old seemed unsteady after the long trip and held onto the arms of aides as he negotiated a mud-slicked path to get to the altar for Mass. ### In his homily, Francis praised the multicultural and multilingual tapestry that makes up Romania and urged its people to put aside past divisions for the sake of ""journeying together."" ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to Sun Herald content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### The rights of around 1.2 million ethnic Hungarians who live in Romania have been at the center of political disputes between the two countries for decades. Hungary lost Transylvania in the peace treaties after World War I yet the region remains heavily Hungarian in both culture and language. ### Those tensions are often reflected in the uneasy relationship between the predominantly Hungarian Roman Catholic community and the Romanian-speaking Greek-Catholic communities. The two rites make up Romania's Catholic minority in the overwhelmingly Orthodox country. ### ""Complicated and sorrow-filled situations from the past must not be forgotten or denied, yet neither must they be an obstacle or an excuse standing in the way of our desire to live together as brothers and sisters,"" Francis said. ### The pope delivered the homily in Italian, and it was translated into Romanian and Hungarian. ### After Mass, with the weather improved, Francis was able to fly by helicopter back to the airport for a flight to another corner of Romania, the university city of Iasi in the northeast. There he had an appointment with young Romanians and their families. ### ""It is a joy, it is a joy,"" said 71-year old Elisabeta Balan, the mother of 11 children who was among those chosen to address the pope in Iasi. ""We are very happy that he comes in Iasi and for this occasion we succeeded in bringing our big family together."" ### Francis was travelling across Romania to visit its far-flung Catholic communities. His trip aimed to make up for the fact that St. John Paul II was only allowed to visit the capital, Bucharest, in 1999 in the first papal visit to a majority Orthodox country. ### On Sunday, Francis travels to the Greek-Catholic stronghold of Blaj to meet with people from the disadvantaged Roma minority. He also plans to beatify seven bishops who were martyred during a brutal period of communist persecution in Romania, then return to Rome.",060119,1,"Pope braves rain-soaked mountain roads for Transylvania Mass | Biloxi Sun Herald###Pope braves rain-soaked mountain roads for Transylvania Mass###By NICOLAE DUMITRACHE and NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press###June 01, 2019 05:15 PM###ORDER REPRINT →###Pope Francis arrives to celebrate Mass at the Marian shrine, in Sumuleu Ciuc, Romania, Saturday, June 1, 2019.

It's spelled center in the U.S., centre in Canada, and either way that position battle may tell the tale when the Raptors host the Warriors in Game 2 of the title matchup. ### Cousins logged only eight minutes in his first game since recovering from a serious quadriceps injury, and it would shock nobody if the Warriors called on him for more as the series goes along. ### ""He did some good things. That was a good first step,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Saturday when assessing Cousins' performance in Game 1. ""So we have to figure out now as a staff, as a team, where does that leave us? Do we increase the minutes? Do we change the role at all? Those are all things we have been discussing."" ### The answers may be critical. ### For as elaborate as certain elements of NBA offenses are, the Raptors operate under a fairly simple pretense — find the open guy. They did that often in Game 1, with Gasol one of the main reasons why. When he's camped out at the 3-point line, Gasol creates space. When the Warriors aimed to take that space away, he found room to maneuver elsewhere. ### ""If the rotation happens and they leave somebody else open, my nature is to make the extra pass,"" Gasol said. ""If they stay home, it is my job to knock it down."" ### When he was struggling to find ways to get any shots to fall in the Eastern Conference finals against Milwaukee, Raptors coach Nick Nurse hinted that lineup changes were coming and the suggestion seemed to be that Gasol would be coming out of the lineup. Turns out, Nurse really had no intention to sit Gasol. He merely had a chat with him, trying to settle him down. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### ""Doesn't hurt,"" Gasol said. ""I don't know if it helped or not, but it certainly doesn't hurt to have your coach say, 'Hey, it's OK.'"" ### The thing Nurse was certain of, when it came to Gasol, that the biggest moments were not going to be too big for a veteran of his stature. ### ""He's not only played in a lot of big NBA games, but he's played on the international stage at the highest level,"" Nurse said. ""I think he has a couple silver medals under his belt or something like that."" ### Nobody's playing for a silver medal in this series. ### And even though it's just one game, the Warriors surely feel some sort of urgency now. Even heading home for Games 3 and 4, a 2-0 hole in the title series would be daunting. ### That's why the decision on Cousins' role is one Kerr isn't taking lightly. A misstep now is a big problem, even for Golden State. ### ""I feel fine,"" Cousins said. ""The adjustments, we'll make those according to what we see fit. We'll take it from there."" ### ———",060119,1,""" He's not only played in a lot of big NBA games, but he's played on the international stage at the highest level,"" Nurse said.

At the top of the list you will typically find more storage, better lighting, updated finishes, etc. However, when a homeowner has Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS), the priorities change with indoor air quality and chemical-free maintenance hitting the top of the list. ### Asthma sufferers or people with severe chemical sensitivities often design and build their own houses with some of these specifications in mind. ### Proper ventilated fan ### Properly installed title to avoid mold ### Quality indoor air ### Remodelers, designers and builders have an ethical obligation to educate homeowners on their options for incorporating low/non-toxic materials that will render any project safe and healthy for its occupants. ### Here are some primary selection criteria for consideration: ### Natural hard surface flooring such as cork, linoleum, wood or tile instead of carpeting, laminate or vinyl to minimize off-gassing and the harboring of dust mites, mildew and/or bacteria. ### Low/No VOC paints and finishes over their high VOC brethren — look for third party certifications such as Green Seal ( www.greenseal.org ) or Green Guard ( www.greenguard.org ) for assurance of low VOC levels. ### Vintage furniture has likely already off-gassed its toxic components so consider buying used. If new furnishings are what you need, look for a manufacturer’s membership in the Sustainable Furnishings Council ( www.sustainablefurnishings.org ) which promotes the manufacturing of sustainable, low toxicity products. ### Stock or semi-custom cabinetry that has earned the Environmental Stewardship Program seal from the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association (KCMA - www.greencabinetsource.org ). ### Custom made cabinetry and furniture that uses only no added formaldehyde plywood, particle board and/or medium density fiber board (MDF) along with low VOC finishes and adhesives. ### Countertop materials that don’t contain high VOC glues, resins or other toxic binding agents and can be maintained without the use of high VOC sealants and cleaning agents. ### Look for untreated natural fibers such as wool, cotton, jute, etc. rather than synthetic fiber materials for window coverings and furnishings. ### Other considerations would include using materials that do not require toxic cleaning agents for routine maintenance and installing prefinished millwork. It is also recommended to analyze and supplement, where necessary, the home’s ventilation including upgrading kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans, installing a filter on a forced air furnace and/or installing a room air exchanger. ### Working with professionals who are well versed in the area of environmental design and construction, is one way to ensure that selected materials and finishes meet the needs of those with chemical sensitivities.
