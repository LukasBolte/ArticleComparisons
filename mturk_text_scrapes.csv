 The Ramco Cements Ltd. has launched crack-resistant, premium blended cement called Ramco Supercrete. It is priced at ₹450 a bag. Touted as an alternative to 53 grade cement, it would address the need for high strength concrete and durability. It is compatible with m-sand. The cement will be initially produced at Ariyalur in Tamil Nadu. Ramco plans to produce four million tonnes, or 30% of the total production, of the new variety during FY20.

 MIERCUREA CIUC, Romania (AP) "" Pope Francis has arrived in Transylvania to visit Romania's most famous shrine on a day of rain-soaked travel to meet with the country's far-flung Catholic communities. 
 Storms forced Francis to change his transport plans Saturday and added in a three-hour car ride through the twisting Carpazi mountains that he had planned to traverse via helicopter. The steady rains doused the faithful gathered for Mass at the Sumuleu Ciuc shrine, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. 
 Francis celebrates Mass and then drives three hours back to the airport for a flight to another corner of Romania, Iasi in the northeast. There he'll meet with young Romanians. 
 Francis is travelling across Romania to make up for the fact that St. John Paul II was only allowed to visit the capital, Bucharest, in 1999.

 RIVERSIDE, Calif. 
 An F-16 fighter jet has been removed from a Southern California warehouse, two weeks after it crashed into the building southeast of Los Angeles. 
 KABC-TV on Friday showed the fuselage and tail of the jet, wrapped in a silver covering, as it was placed on a flatbed trailer. 
 The Air National Guard jet was on a May 16 training flight at March Air Reserve Base when the pilot reported hydraulic problems and started losing control. The pilot safely ejected but the plane crashed through the roof of a commercial warehouse next to the base and a freeway. 
 Miraculously, there was no explosion or serious injuries.

 ORDER REPRINT → 
 MONTPELIER, Vt. 
 Vermont's capital city is going to be using goats again as a way to control poison ivy and other unwanted plants without herbicides. 
 The city doesn't want to use the herbicides near the Winooski River and Montpelier High School and the goats are able to digest the poison ivy and other plants. 
 Assistant City Manager Sue Allen tells the Times Argus the goats are part of a several-year effort to control poison ivy without chemicals near the Montpelier recreation path. 
 She says the goats eat the poison ivy while other acceptable species can gradually take over the area.

 An East Quogue man was killed Saturday morning in a single-car accident on Old Country Road near Lewis Road in East Quogue.

 Gianni Mongelluzo, 22, was driving a 1996 Chevrolet Corvette at the time of the accident, police said. 
 Volunteers from the East Quogue Fire Department had to extricate him from the car, and he was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said. 
 Police did not offer a cause for the accident, which was still under investigation Saturday night.

 Crackdown on funeral scams by City minister John Glen 
 June 2 2019, 12:01am, 
 City minister John Glen 
 The City watchdog is set to clamp down on misleading funeral sales tactics. 
 The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will take on oversight of the pre-paid sector after concerns that some funeral planners are pressuring bereaved families into unsuitable purchases. It is the first time the industry has been regulated. Laws governing funerals have not changed since 2001. 
 Those who breach new regulations could be stripped of their ability to sell plans, fined or even prosecuted. About 177,000 pre-paid funerals were sold last year at an average cost of £2,500 to £5,000. 
 The FCA clampdown was devised by City minister John Glen.

 MADURAI 
 Three youth suffered cut injuries after they were attacked by an armed gang at S. Puliyankulam on Thursday. Police said that S. Balamurugan, 23, and his friends were watching a movie on a mobile phone. 
 One A. Athivalavan, 35, who came to the spot on a motorbike, mistook that the group of friends who were laughing while watching the movie were targeting him. 
 A quarrel erupted between them, and Athivalavan and his friends assaulted Balamurugan and his friends with a knife and a sword. 
 Balamurugan, C. Vasanth, 23, and G. Rajkumar, 27, sustained injuries and were admitted to the Government Rajaji Hospital here. 
 Athivalavan has been arrested by Silaiman police.

 Louisiana Senate refuses inhalation for medical marijuana 
 The Associated Press 
 BATON ROUGE, La. 
 The Senate has refused to let Louisiana's medical marijuana patients inhale cannabis. 
 A bill by Baton Rouge Democratic Rep. Ted James would have let therapeutic cannabis patients use an inhaler, like asthma patients use. 
 St. Martin Parish Republican Sen. Fred Mills said the change wouldn't allow vaping of medical marijuana. But Sen. Dan Claitor, a Baton Rouge Republican, said the proposal made him uncomfortable because the language didn't seem tight enough. 
 Senators voted 21-14 Saturday to strike that language from a regulatory bill involving the medical marijuana program, then killed the bill.

 She fined Roth $11,000 with $7,500 suspended and Winslow $11,200 with $7,500 suspended.

 Back to Gallery 
 The day after Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green and Canadian rapper and Toronto Raptors superfan Drake mouthed off to each other after Game 1 of the NBA Finals , Draymond is keeping the beef going. 
 Or so it seems. 
 In the latest installment of the #Drakemond saga, Green posted a video to his Instagram Stories Friday afternoon that shows him walking around in Toronto with a devilish grin on his face. 
 ""In these Toronto streets,"" Green said a few seconds into the video, continuing with his guileful smile. 
 A moment later, he revealed his punchline: He was trotting through Toronto wearing a hoodie bearing the name of Michael Jordan's eponymous brand and the logo of Drake's October's Very Own company. Under Jordan's name, there's a line that reads, ""Quality Inspired By The Greatest Player Ever.""

 He threw three crying laughing emojis on top of the video before posting it, for good measure. 
 Green's playful jab at Drake continued a sometimes heated dialogue that spiked as the Warriors headed for their locker room after the buzzer sounded on their 119-109 loss to the Raptors in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Right after the game ended, Green walked over to where Drake was sitting courtside at Scotiabank Arena and began talking to him. 
 It's unclear exactly what was said between the two, but it ended with Drake shaking his head at the Warriors star ( and maybe yelling ""trash"" at him ) while Steph Curry pulled Green away. 
 Drake's outsized personality on the court has been the subject of controversy before and since the NBA Finals started, and Draymond has been one of the major players in the drama.

 SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois House approved a $40 billion state operating budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 on a bipartisan vote before adjourning Friday night, pushing further action on a host of other issues to an impromptu Saturday morning session. 
 The legislative leaders of each chamber had several meetings with Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker throughout the day as House Republicans withheld their votes while seeking concessions from Democrats. 
 At 1 p.m., Deputy House Minority Leader Tom Demmer, a Dixon Republican, released a statement saying Democrats “withheld information, added additional taxes and rejected any attempts to grow our economy.” 
 By 9:45 p.m., Demmer was speaking on the floor about the balanced budget proposal that was a product of compromise. A flurry of closed-door meetings filled the eight hours in between. 
 Only three speakers from each party were allowed to address the matter on the floor, per an agreement between House leaders, and discussion lasted about 20 minutes before the measure passed, 83-35. 
 House Majority Leader Gregory Harris, a Chicago Democrat, extolled the budget as one that funds higher education and K-12 schools while making full pension payments and contributing $1.4 billion to paying down part of the state’s backlog of unpaid bills 
 He said $1.2 billion to the backlog payments would be funded by bond borrowing and another $200 million would be funded by an anticipated budget surplus. He said paying down debts will save on the 12 percent daily interest the state is paying on some of the oldest bills, saving hundreds of millions of dollars in the long run. 
 Minority Leader Jim Durkin, a Western Springs Republican, called the budget “a start” to progress in Illinois that is “fair” to taxpayers and businesses. 
 “Because we worked together and we made some concessions, both sides tonight, we’re able to say that we have a balanced budget for this FY 20 year,” he said. 
 Durkin said several business-centric measures requested by Republicans are expected to be approved Saturday. 
 Business-backed measures released with Demmer’s afternoon statement include tax incentives aimed at enticing data centers to locate in Illinois; eliminating reporting of the retailer's discount in the comptroller's tax expenditure report; eliminating the franchise tax; reinstating the manufacturers purchase credit; and a “Blue Collar Jobs Act to help attract large-scale projects.” 
 Republican Rep. David McSweeney, however, said he was not happy with the limited debate or the contents of the budget bill, calling Durkin a “failed leader” that is “in bed with the Democrats.” 
 “Republicans and Democrats got together in a closed room and put together a budget that is at least $1 billion over what the governor himself requested,” he said. “There's no provision for controlling spending. There's no pension reform. There's no Medicaid reform. There's actually no reduction in spending.” 
 McSweeney, of Barrington Hills, said few if any lawmakers had time to read the 1,581 pages in the appropriations bill, which was released at noon, less than 10 hours before it was passed. 
 Illinois House OKs $40B budget, work continues 
 The General Revenue Fund spending in the budget is estimated at $39.9 billion. An added $600 million in supplemental spending for fiscal year 2019, most of which will go to paying back pay for step increases to state employee salaries that former Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner withheld, would bring the total to about $40.6 billion. 
 The budget includes $375 million in added state funding for K-12 education, $25 million more than is mandated by the state’s evidence-based funding formula. It also increases mandated categorical funding for K-12 education by $47.3 million, bringing expenditures in that area to $928.8 million. 
 Funding for early childhood education would increase by $50 million, up to $543.7 million. 
 Higher education will see an increase by $134 million over fiscal year 2019 levels, increasing to $1.94 billion. The increase would include $50 million more than last year for Monetary Award Grant funding and 5 percent increases to state university and college operations. 
 The Department of Human Services, the Department on Aging, and the Department of Children and Family Services would all see increases in the rates they pay to care providers to cover the state’s increase to the minimum wage. Overall, human service departments would see an increase of $567 million from last year’s budget. 
 General revenue funding for DCFS would increase by $89 million from fiscal year 2019, bringing the total up to $845 million. 
 Harris said the budget also includes funding for a census grant program which will allow the state to gain more funding from the federal government by maximizing the number of citizens counted in the census.",1
29482,"Carpenter's 10th-inning hit lifts Cards over Cubs 
 e-mail 
 Matt Carpenter hit a game-ending, bases-loaded single in the 10th inning to send the host St. Louis Cardinals to a 2-1 victory against the Chicago Cubs on Friday night. 
 Carpenter sent a fly ball the opposite way to a largely vacant left field, as the Cubs had loaded four defenders on the right side of the infield. The hit off Steve Cishek scored Kolten Wong, who had doubled into the right field corner with one out, and secured the Cardinals' first walk-off victory of the season. 
 Chicago relievers Kyle Ryan, Brad Brach and Brandon Kintzler collaborated on three innings of perfect, three-strikeout relief before St. Louis' 10th inning rally against Mike Montgomery (1-1), Dillon Maples and Cishek. 
 Jordan Hicks (2-2) was the winner, pitching hitless ball in the ninth and 10th with two walks and two strikeouts. 
 Cubs right-hander Yu Darvish turned in one of his sharpest starts of the season, pitching six innings of three-hit, one-run ball with six strikeouts and three walks. 
 St. Louis capitalized on Darvish's early control issues to score a first-inning run. After Darvish walked the first two hitters, cleanup batter Marcell Ozuna contributed a sacrifice fly to give the Cardinals an early lead. 
 Darvish settled down after that, retiring nine in a row before Paul Goldschmidt collected the Cardinals' first hit, a leadoff single in the fourth. 
 The Cardinals threatened with two on and one out in the fifth but were unable to score, as pitcher Miles Mikolas struck out on a foul bunt and Carpenter struck out looking at a payoff pitch. 
 Mikolas also took a no-decision with seven innings of one-run ball, spacing six hits, three strikeouts and two walks. The lone run he yielded came in the second, when Darvish hit a sacrifice fly to score Victor Caratini, who led off the inning with a ground-rule double. 
 Chicago also had its chances against Mikolas. 
 The Cubs also couldn't cash in with the bases loaded and two outs in the first. Chicago collected consecutive singles to start the fourth but followed with a flyout and a double-play grounder. Albert Almora Jr. hit a two-out triple in the seventh, but the Cubs were unable to score. 
 Wong (2-for-4) was the only player with a multi-hit game.

 AUSTIN – A former high school history teacher and one-time Michigan assistant will become Texas coach Shaka Smart’s top lieutenant, the school announced Friday. 
 Luke Yaklich, 43, will join the Longhorns as an associate head coach, replacing Darrin Horn, who earlier this year became the head coach at Northern Kentucky University. 
 ""His background as a head coach at the high school level for many years gives him a unique perspective in terms of the way he interacts with players,"" Smart said. ""Luke is a true teacher. That word gets thrown around a lot, but he literally was in the classroom for nearly 15 years and still thinks of himself that way. 
 ""Luke has a phenomenal work ethic and a consistent drive to help his teams be successful,"" Smart said. ""He's a good fit for our staff because he brings a passion and commitment to all the little things and the details that go into making a program successful. He is not in any way afraid to roll up his sleeves and do whatever is needed."" 
 ON TEXAS SPORTS NATION:  After rapid ascent, Texas' Jaxson Hayes ready to take on NBA 
 Yaklich spent the past two seasons as an assistant on Michigan coach Jon Beilein's staff. During that time the Wolverines compiled a 63-15 record and advanced to the 2018 NCAA championship game and 2019 Sweet Sixteen. 
 Beilein on May 13 left his longtime post at Michigan to become head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, leading Yaklich to seek out other opportunities. 
 ""Throughout my coaching career, I've always aspired to continue to grow,"" Yaklich said. ""Part of that growth process for me was to study great coaches who build their programs around a culture. I studied what coach Smart had done at VCU when I was a high school coach and continued to follow him at Texas when I began coaching in college. 
 “When coach Beilein accepted the Cleveland Cavaliers job and this position was open, I talked to coach Smart about what he was looking for with this position and became incredibly excited about this opportunity to coach at The University of Texas.” 
 Prior to that stint at Michigan, Yaklich spent four seasons as an assistant at Illinois State. 
 Before returning to his alma mater, Yaklich worked as a high school coach and teacher for 14 years. He led Joliet Township (Ill.) for six seasons and compiled a 104-62 record. He also enjoyed successful stints as the head boys' coach at La Salle-Peru Township (Ill.), head boys’ coach at Sterling (Ill.) and head girls' coach at La Salle-Peru. 
 ""I want to help us become the best possible defensive team that we can and work with each of our student-athletes on a daily basis to help them grow on and off the court,” Yaklich said. “Ultimately, we want to win Big 12 Conference titles, get to the NCAA Tournament and advance, and play for a national championship.""",1

 A bill that establishes a “fundamental right” for women to get an abortion in Illinois cleared the state Senate late Friday night , sending the sweeping measure to Gov. J.B. Pritzker , who already has signaled his support. 
 As the clock approached midnight Friday, the Senate voted 34-20 in favor of the abortion legislation, which comes amid an increased sense of urgency among advocates looking to protect abortion access as a series of states have passed laws essentially banning the practice. 
 “I believe, frankly, there’s a war against women’s rights going on,” Sen. Melinda Bush, the Grayslake Democrat who sponsored the bill in the Senate, said about the restrictive laws other states have passed. 
 The bill establishes the “fundamental right” of a women to have an abortion and states that a “fertilized egg, embryo or fetus does not have independent rights.” It repeals the Illinois Abortion Law of 1975, doing away with provisions for spousal consent, waiting periods, criminal penalties for physicians who perform abortions and other restrictions on facilities where abortions are performed.

 The bill, called the Reproductive Health Act, treats abortion “like every other medical procedure,” Bush said. 
 Republican Sen. Sue Rezin of Morris, however, called the measure a “radical” expansion of what’s allowed under the law. 
 And Sen. Dale Righter , a Mattoon Republican, said the idea that the measure is necessary “simply to protect a woman’s right to choose is not accurate.” 
 “This bill goes much further and does much more,” Righter said. 
 Illinois Senate approves $40 billion budget hours after plan passed by House » 
 After the 65-40 House vote Tuesday, Pritzker issued a statement saying he was eager to sign the measure into law. 
 “Illinois is making history, because our state will now be the most progressive in the nation for reproductive healthcare. In Illinois, we trust women to make the most personal and fundamental decisions of their lives — and now, that will be the law of the land, even as it’s under threat in other states,” Pritzker said in a statement. 
 Proponents of the bill headed to Pritzker’s desk said that while certain provisions in Illinois’ abortion law are not enforced because of court injunctions, pending cases could lead to overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case, which legalized abortion nationwide.

 In Missouri, one of the states that recently passed a restrictive abortion law , a judge on Friday ruled that the state’s last abortion provider’s license would not expire. 
 The Illinois bill also repeals the state’s Partial-Birth Abortion law, but a federal law banning the late-term procedure except  to save a mother’s life remains in place. 
 “There is nothing more intrinsic to freedom than bodily autonomy,” said Democratic Sen. Toi Hutchinson of Olympia Fields. 
 Bush said she and other supporters of the measure have faced threats. 
 “We’re not going back,” Bush said. “We’re not going back to coat hangers, we’re not going back to dying. We’re not going back. And I am proud to say Illinois is a beacon. For women’s rights, for human rights.”",1
86407,"Baguio Mayor-elect confronts old woes 
 Philippine Daily Inquirer / 05:00 AM June 01, 2019 
 Benjamin Magalong -Valerie Damian 
 Retired police general Benjamin Magalong spearheaded the fact-finding team that implicated Malacañang and police officials in the botched 2015 Mamasapano operation that killed 44 Special Action Force troopers. 
 In the May 13 midterm elections, the former chief of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group defeated eight mayoral candidates, including incumbent Vice Mayor Edison Bilog and Councilor Edgar Avila. 
 ADVERTISEMENT 
 Magalong, 58, is a member of the Philippine Military Academy “Sandigan” Class of 1982. He served the Philippine National Police on various capacities for 38 years and retired as its deputy chief for operations in 2016. 
 After retirement, he became the senior vice president for operations of Steel Asia, the country’s largest steel manufacturer. 
 FEATURED STORIES 
  
 Baguio boy 
 Born and raised in Baguio, Magalong said the problems of traffic, garbage and pollution, among other things, stemmed from the failure of the local government to implement the master development plan of the city. 
 He said the city needed to come up with a strategic plan with short-term and long-term solutions to address these problems. 
 “We have already gone past our carrying capacity,” Magalong said, adding that the city government cannot do it alone and must engage and work with residents. 
 Lack of space 
 Magalong said there were 57,000 registered private and public vehicles in the city as of 2018 but the present road system cannot accommodate this volume. 
 ADVERTISEMENT 
 He said he has tapped the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority to help him gather data and analyze the present situation and provide immediate adjustments to the traffic flow. 
 He said there was also a need to build parking buildings and centralized terminals for public utility vehicles. 
 Recognizing that there is a lack of open space in the city, he said the roads must be widened. “We need to secure road right of way but that will take time,” he said. 
 Waste disposal 
 Magalong said the city government spent around P100 million for waste disposal last year. “If we can put up a waste management system at zero cost to the city government, we can save around P100 million that can be used for social services,” he said. 
 According to him, he is also considering building an engineered sanitary landfill and waste-to-energy projects or a biomass plant. 
 “It will be a challenge but we will need to get the approval of the community,” he said. 
 Sewerage system 
 The incoming mayor said there was a need to rehabilitate the sewerage system of the city, and build a treatment facility. 
 “We are looking at the modular type of treatment facilities due to lack of space … The rehabilitation of sewer lines will need capitalization, we need to get help from the national government, private groups and foreign entities that provide grants for rehabilitation of the environment,” he said. 
 Crimes and calamities 
 Magalong said crimes were the biggest threat to the city. He plans to acquire a technology that will consolidate and improve existing anticrime systems and integrate it with emergency response. 
 He said it would be an integrated command center for traffic, disaster and emergency response. “You have a command center where all [closed-circuit television cameras] are connected for monitoring,” he said. 
 He said there was also a mobile phone application that can quickly report and respond to crimes and calamities. The technology is worth around P170 million and President Duterte has already committed to fund an emergency response system, he said. 
 Overpopulation 
 “It is about time to implement the BLISTT (Baguio-La Trinidad-Itogon-Sablan-Tuba-Tublay) as the only way to depopulate the city,” he said. 
 He said the BLISTT would also benefit the other towns as it would spur their development. 
 “BLISTT cannot be enforced, it needs social acceptability,” he said, adding that these areas’ development should become a shared enterprise. 
 Governance 
 “We need to develop a strong management team composed of competent leaders and workers who must perform their mandate to meet targets,” Magalong said. 
 He said he would introduce a “kind of leadership that inspires.” 
 “If people are inspired, they innovate. They go the extra mile,” he said.

 In his first public comments about his Russia report, special counsel Robert Mueller made clear the probe did not exonerate President Donald Trump. And as AP's Eric Tucker explains, he also said it's now up to Congress to hold Trump accountable. 
 President Donald Trump blasts special counsel Robert Mueller, as a “never Trumper” who led a biased investigation on Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. 
 Special counsel Robert Mueller said Wednesday he believed he was constitutionally barred from charging President Donald Trump with a crime but pointedly emphasized his Russia report did not exonerate the president. 
 Save 
 WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is distorting the findings of the Russia investigation, claiming exoneration and a possible case against him ""closed"" based on remarks from a special counsel who did not make either statement. 
 ""Robert Mueller would have brought charges, if he had ANYTHING, but there were no charges to bring!"" Trump tweeted Thursday. 
 ""CASE CLOSED,"" he said in another tweet. 
 Special counsel Robert Mueller this past week announced the end to his work in the Russia probe and said he would return to private life. But Mueller specifically declined to vindicate Trump on obstruction charges, indicating it was up to Congress to decide whether to take up continued investigations and bring charges of wrongdoing against a sitting president. 
 Trump is also asserting that Mueller was hopelessly biased and ""conflicted,"" broadly dismissing his two-year investigation as a hoax and witch hunt. Trump's own aides, however, have previously rejected his complaints about Mueller as groundless. And the Mueller investigation produced a number of guilty pleas, convictions and criminal charges as part of a review that ultimately concluded Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was ""sweeping and systematic."" 
 The statements helped cap a week of unsupported assertion by the president on trade, the economy, North Korea and more. 
 A review: 
 RUSSIA INVESTIGATION 
 TRUMP: ""There was no crime. There was no obstruction. There was no collusion."" — remarks Thursday to reporters. 
 TRUMP, on Mueller's statement on finishing his work as special counsel: ""There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you."" — tweet Wednesday. 
 SARAH SANDERS, White House press secretary: ""The Special Counsel has completed the investigation, closed his office, and has closed the case. ... The report was clear—there was no collusion, no conspiracy—and the Department of Justice confirmed there was no obstruction. ...After two years, the Special Counsel is moving on with his life, and everyone else should do the same."" — statement Wednesday. 
 THE FACTS: Mueller did not fully exonerate Trump or declare that a possible case against Trump to be ""closed."" While announcing his work was now finished, Mueller specifically left it open for Congress to decide on possible charges of wrongdoing. Mueller also did not say there was ""insufficient evidence"" as to possible crimes of obstruction, making clear that his report did not draw a conclusion. 
 Mueller said his team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge Trump, partly because of a Justice Department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn't be indicted. 
 As a result, his detailed report factually laid out instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, leaving it up to Congress to take up the matter. 
 ""If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,"" Mueller said Wednesday. Based on that department's legal opinion, Mueller said, ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing."" 
 Attorney General William Barr wrote in a March 24 letter that ultimately he was deciding that the evidence developed by Mueller was ""not sufficient"" to establish, for the purposes of prosecution, that Trump committed obstruction of justice. But Mueller explicitly declined to say that. 
 It's true the Mueller report did not find a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, saying it had not collected sufficient evidence ""to establish"" or sustain criminal charges. However, the report did not assess whether ""collusion"" occurred. 
 ——— 
 TRUMP, on Mueller's relationship with former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump: ""He loves Comey. You look at the relationship with those two. So whether it's love or deep like, but he was conflicted."" — remarks Thursday to reporters. 
 THE FACTS: Though Comey succeeded Mueller as FBI director and though they served together in the Bush administration, the men are not known to be social friends. There is certainly no evidence, as Trump has repeatedly suggested, that they are ""best friends"" or have a relationship that is ""love or deep like."" 
 ——— 
 TRUMP: ""I think he's totally conflicted. ...Robert Mueller should've never been chosen because he wanted the FBI job and he didn't get it. And the next day, he was picked as Special Counsel. So you tell somebody, 'I'm sorry, you can't have the job.' And then, after you say that, he's going to make a ruling on you? It doesn't work that way. Plus, we had a business dispute."" — remarks Thursday to reporters. 
 THE FACTS: Trump makes a groundless charge that Mueller was ""totally conflicted."" Mueller, a longtime Republican, was cleared by the Justice Department's ethics experts to lead the Russia investigation. 
 According to the special counsel's report, when Trump previously complained privately to aides that Mueller would not be objective, the advisers, including then-White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, then-White House counsel Don McGahn and Reince Priebus, chief of staff at the time, rejected his complaints of an alleged business dispute and possible bad feelings over the FBI job as not representing ""true conflicts."" Bannon called the claims ""ridiculous."" 
 Bannon told Mueller's investigators that while the White House had invited Mueller to speak to the president about the FBI and thought about asking him to become director again, Mueller did not come in looking for a job. Mueller was previously FBI director from 2001 to 2013. 
 ——— 
 TRUMP: ""There's no nothing. It's nothing but a witch hunt."" — remarks Thursday to reporters. 
 TRUMP: ""They don't talk about Russia anymore because it turned out to be a hoax. It was all a hoax."" — remarks Thursday. 
 THE FACTS: A two-year investigation that produced guilty pleas, convictions and criminal charges against Russian intelligence officers and others with ties to the Kremlin, as well as Trump associates, is not a hoax. Mueller's report concluded there was ""sweeping and systematic"" Russian interference in the 2016 election. 
 Mueller charged 34 people, including the president's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and three Russian companies. Twenty-five Russians were indicted on charges related to election interference, accused either of hacking Democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the internet. 
 Five Trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller, and a sixth, longtime confidant Roger Stone, is awaiting trial on charges he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering.

 ECONOMY 
 TRUMP: ""Employment numbers are the best. We have close to 160 million people working today, which is more than we've ever had before."" — remarks Thursday to reporters. 
 THE FACTS: It's true that more people are working now, but that is driven by population growth. A more relevant measure is the proportion of Americans with jobs, and that is still far below record highs. 
 × 
 {{featured_button_text}} 
 According to Labor Department data, 60.6 percent of people in the United States 16 years and older were working in April. That's below the all-time high of 64.7 percent in April 2000, though higher than the 59.9 percent when Trump was inaugurated in January 2017. 
 The Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate dropped in April to 3.6% from 3.8%. That drop reflected a healthy economy for sure, but also an increase in the number of Americans who stopped looking for work. 
 ——— 
 NORTH KOREA 
 TRUMP, on limited progress by North Korea to ""denuclearize"": ""So I think that he is — he is going to try, at some point. I'm in no rush at all. ...We, as you know, are getting the remains — continuing to get the remains."" — news conference Monday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 
 THE FACTS: U.S. efforts to recover additional remains of American service members have stalled amid souring relations with North Korea. 
 Last month, as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea spiked again, the Pentagon said it had suspended its efforts this year to arrange negotiations on recovering additional remains of American service members killed in the North during the Korean War. The Pentagon said it remained hopeful they can reach agreement with the North for recovery operations in 2020. 
 The Defense POW-MIA Accounting Agency said it has had no communication with North Korean authorities since the Vietnam summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last February. That meeting focused on the North's nuclear weapons and followed a June 2018 summit where Kim committed to permitting a resumption of U.S. remains recovery; that effort had been suspended by the U.S. in 2005. 
 The agency said it had ""reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan, coordinate, and conduct field operations"" with the North during this budget year, which ends Sept. 30. The North, it said, never agreed to face-to-face negotiations to work out details for the recovery operations, such as payments required for the provision of support services by the North Korean army. 
 Last summer, in line with the first Trump-Kim summit in June, the North turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of U.S service members killed in the North during the 1950-53 war. So far, six Americans have been identified from the 55 boxes. 
 U.S. officials have said the North has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of American war remains. Thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former POW camps.

 TRUMP: ""We're taking in billions of dollars in tariffs. China is subsidizing products. So the United States' taxpayers are paying for very little of it. "" — remarks Thursday to reporters. 
 TRUMP: ""You know, foolishly, some people said that the American taxpayer is paying the tariffs of China. No, no, no — it's not that way. They're paying a small percentage, but our country is taking in billions and billions of dollars."" — news conference Monday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 
 THE FACTS: That's not true. U.S. consumers and the public are primarily if not entirely paying the costs of the tariffs, as his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has acknowledged . That's how tariffs work: Importers pay the taxes and often pass on the cost to consumers. The U.S. is not ""taking in"" billions from China as a result. 
 A sustained trade dispute is not painless for China, either. Its goods become pricier and therefore less competitive. But China is not paying a tab to the U.S. treasury in this matter. 
 As Kudlow said, accurately: ""Both sides will suffer on this."" But in his view, ""this is a risk we should and can take.""

 MARS 
 TRUMP: ""Prime Minister Abe and I have agreed to dramatically expand our nations' cooperation in human space exploration. Japan will join our mission to send U.S. astronauts to space. We'll be going to the moon. We'll be going to Mars very soon."" — news conference Monday. 
 THE FACTS: Not very soon. The U.S. will almost certainly not be sending humans to Mars in his presidency, even if he wins a second term. 
 The Trump administration has a placed a priority on the moon over Mars for human exploration (President Barack Obama favored Mars) and hopes to accelerate NASA's plan for returning people to the lunar surface. It has asked Congress to approve enough money to make a moon mission possible by 2024, instead 2028. But even if that happens, Mars would come years after that. International space agencies have made aspirational statements about possibly landing humans on Mars during the 2030s.

 IRAN 
 TRUMP: ""If you look at the deal that Biden and President Obama signed, they would have access — free access — to nuclear weapons, where they wouldn't even be in violation, in just a very short period of time. What kind of a deal is that?"" — news conference Monday. 
 THE FACTS: That's a misrepresentation of what the deal required . Iran would not have access to nuclear weapons capability in a ""very short period"" without violating the terms of the 2015 accord. The U.S. withdrew from the multinational agreement last year. 
 During the 15-year life of most provisions of the deal, Iran's capabilities were limited to a level where it could not produce a nuclear bomb. Iran was thought to be only months away from a bomb when the deal came into effect. 
 After 15 years, Iran could have an array of advanced centrifuges ready to work, the limits on its stockpile would be gone and, in theory, it could then throw itself into producing highly enriched uranium. But nothing in the deal prevented the West from trying to rein Iran in again with sanctions. The deal included a pledge by Iran never to seek a nuclear weapon. In return, partners in the deal eased sanctions on Iran.

27528,"Class of 2019: BHS graduates recognized for grit, perseverance 
 By Theresa Bourke Today  at 4:00 a.m.

 Brainerd High School graduates in the Class of 2019 toss their caps after receiving diplomas during their commencement ceremony Friday, May 31, at Adamson Field. Kelly Humphrey / Brainerd Dispatch2 / 3 
 Several Brainerd High School graduates sported decorated caps during their commencement ceremony Friday, May 31, at Adamson Field. Kelly Humphrey / Brainerd Dispatch3 / 3 
 They descended the long staircase while ""Pomp and Circumstance"" played—many stopping along the way to hug or shake hands with School Resource Office Troy Schreifels. 
 They flipped their tassels, they posed for selfies and they tossed their bright blue caps. That means the Brainerd High School Class of 2019 officially graduated. 
 On a breezy 80-degree evening, the 423 seniors walked across the stage on Adamson Field—in front of family, friends and staff—to receive their diplomas Friday, May 31, and begin their post-high school lives. 
 But before the national anthem filled the air and before speeches began, Principal Andrea Rusk called for a moment of silence in memory of classmate Dalerie DeRosier, a BHS senior who died unexpectedly May 15. 
 Then the Class of 2019's motto took shape through musical numbers and inspirational words.

 ""Take pride in how far you've come. Have faith in how far you can go. But don't forget to enjoy the journey,"" reads the quote from author Michael Josephson students chose as their class motto. 
 All three student speakers channeled that motto as they reminisced about both good times and bad, applauded classmates for their hard work and encouraged them to never stop striving for success. 
 Perseverance reigned as the theme throughout Chase Christian's speech, as she told her classmates that despite various differences, they're all alike through their high school accomplishments. 
 ""Each of us has had to fail, we've all had to push through when we're struggling,"" she said. ""Perseverance is something that can't be taught into a curriculum, but it's the one lesson that all of us have learned. It's the common ground between every student, staff member and audience member here today. Perseverance is what we have in common."" 
 And perseverance, she said, isn't just about doing something well or exceeding at something you're good at. 
 ""It's pushing through in times of defeat, in times of failure, persevering when it seems like nothing is going your way,"" Christian said. ""It's pushing through something you're not good at."" 
 Adrian Olson also noted the students' persistence, especially while dealing with several challenges throughout high school, like a new block schedule, unwanted yearbook attention and the crazy clown chaos that swept the country in 2016. 
 ""Through all of this I've observed us persevering through all the change and bizarreness,"" she said. 
 It just took a little adjustment, as student speaker Noah Sundberg said when talking about the newness of the class's freshman year and the challenges that lay ahead. 
 ""This was our first year our classes would truly challenge us,"" Sundberg said. ""We all were trying to figure out who we are and who are new friends would be. This was a wave of readjustment."" 
 Despite periods of adjustment, Principal Andrea Rusk said the students in the Class of 2019 have always worked hard and striven to be good people. 
 ""I would say that you have grit, and you have perseverance. When faced with challenges, you don't take flight, you take it on,"" Rusk told the graduates. ""When life gets tough, you get tougher. Don't lose those qualities. ... They will serve you very well in your next chapter in life."" 
 All of those trials and adjustments, Olson noted, were just small parts of the students' own personal ""speeches,"" which began for many when they first stepped foot in the halls of South Campus as nervous freshmen four years ago. 
 ""Unsurprisingly, we haven't all followed the same course in our journeys creating this speech that is four years of high school, but we've kept going together,"" Olson said. ""There's plenty of things that managed to impact all of us on our journeys ... both good and bad, joyful and mournful, keepable and improvable."" 
 Both Olson and Sundberg noted tragic losses were among the mournful times, but the memories of those they lost, Olson pointed out, are honored by driving students to think about how they treat others and how they approach mental illnesses. 
 ""This is a valuable thing to learn so early on—to keep going and take something bad and try to make the world better to honor and prevent further such loss,"" Olson said. ""It is true, everyone will have horrible things happen in their lives, but it is what you do during those valleys that will determine the height of your peaks as you keep going."" 
 He told his fellow graduates not to dwell on the valleys, but always to persevere. 
 ""Don't let yourself get stuck in one spot of your life 'speech,'"" Olson concluded, ""because your 'speech' is never really over until you stop trying."" 
 Faculty speaker Heidi Anderson, family and consumer science teacher, emphasized that point as well, telling seniors they alone are in charge of how they react to difficult situations. 
 ""As you move on from this chapter of your life, you are going to face a lot of traffic jams, long lines and hard moments,"" she said. ""You get to decide how to react."" 
 When the students inevitably have to write a paper in college, work a double shift or help their parents with a big job, they should think carefully, Anderson said, about how to handle the situation. 
 ""You've got to do it, you may as well enjoy yourself while you're at it,"" she said. ""Or at the very least, realize that complaining about it won't make it go away and will probably only make the situation worse. Every moment is a choice."" 
 With Anderson's speech perhaps the last morsel of high school teacher advice the graduates will receive, Christian noted teachers played a big role in helping the students accomplish the feat of high school. Even bigger, she said, than some of his classmates may want to admit. 
 ""These teachers do a lot more than just teach. They helped to raise us. They didn't just raise teachers, they had to raise aspiring biologists, mechanics, doctors, vets, stay-at-home parents,"" Christian said. ""Teachers help raise a generation. They go outside their field of work to help each student grow into who we are. And we owe them a lot. They raised us, and they raised us into the successful people we're about to be when we go out into the real world."" 
 There will be many high and low points in the real world, Anderson reminded the graduates. 
 ""That is life,"" she said. ""There is no crystal ball to see into your future. Just remember you may not be able to control those moments, but you can control how you react and respond in those moments. That is your choice and in your power."" 
 Similarly, School Board Chair Sue Kern told graduates to hold tight to their faith and their dreams to help bear the difficult days and make the good days even brighter. 
 ""Your faith will give you your grace when you need it most,"" Kern said, ""and your dreams will help you focus on better days to come."" 
 With that power and wisdom in hand, Sundberg expressed certainty of the students' success in the real world because it's something they've been striving toward for the past four years. 
 ""While this new chapter in life may seem daunting,"" Sundberg said, ""we have been through all this before, but we did it together. We are no longer those young and naive freshmen. We are Warriors.""

56503,"Former Jets player Muhammad Wilkerson arrested for DWI 
 Updated 
 10:24 pm EDT, Saturday, June 1, 2019 
 NEW YORK (AP) — Former New York Jets defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson is charged with driving while intoxicated after his arrest in New York City. 
 A police spokesman says the 29-year-old was arraigned Saturday in Manhattan Criminal Court and released on his own recognizance. 
 In addition to DWI, he's accused of ignoring a stop sign and driving while ability-impaired. 
 Police say he was pulled over in the Washington Heights neighborhood before dawn with a blood-alcohol level of .09. The legal limit is .08. 
 His attorney, Alex Spiro, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
 It was not clear when the Linden, New Jersey, resident is to appear in court again. 
 Wilkerson played for the Jets from 2011 to 2017, and with the Green Bay Packers last year. He's now a free agent.",1

 Data: Home sales ramping up after slow start to spring 
 SUN GAZETTE NEWSPAPERS 
 Save 
 Spring got a late start in the national real-estate market, according to new data from RE/MAX. 
 While the March-over-February increase in home sales of 28.8 percent was the smallest in five years, the April-over-March increase of 11.2 percent was a record for those months during the 10-year history of the company’s monthly homes report. 
 “April’s home sales blossomed, suggesting the typical seasonal jump in spring sales arrived later than usual this year,” said RE/MAX CEO Adam Contos. “Solid buyer interest and sellers with realistic price expectations advanced the market’s march toward equilibrium last month.” 
 “That said, inventory remains constricted, and prices continue to climb, albeit at a slower rate,” Contos said. “All in all, April’s results were encouraging, and we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the prospects of a healthy spring selling season.” 
 Of the 54 metro areas surveyed, the home sales were up 11.2 percent in April compared to March, though down 1.1 percent compared to April 2018. Leading the month-over-month sales percentage increase were Augusta (Maine) at 30.4 percent, with Des Moines (Iowa) increasing 23.6 percent and Milwaukee up 22.9 percent. 
 April’s year-over-year sales decline of 1.1 percent marked the ninth consecutive month of year-over-year decreases, but April’s sales dip was the smallest during that time. 
 In April 2019, the median of all 54 metro median sales prices was $251,000, up 2.1 percent from March 2019, and also up 2.1 percent from April 2018. 
 Three metro areas – San Francisco, Seattle and Anchorage – saw a year-over-year decrease in median sales price, while Boise (Idaho) led the market with an increase of 14.8 percent, followed by Birmingham (Ala.) at 13.8 percent. 
 The average days on the market for homes sold in April 2019 was 52, a healthy improvement of seven days from March and essentially on par with April 2018. Omaha (Neb.) had the most brisk pace in April, at an average 27 days, followed by Denver and San Francisco at 30, while Augusta, Hartford (Conn.) and Miami had some of the longest days on the market.",1
89242,"House teeters on the edge of cliff over Lake Michigan 
 Updated: Sat 10:28 PM, Jun 01, 2019 
 KENOSHA COUNTY, Wis. (WTMJ/CNN) - A Wisconsin family is struggling with what to do about their home, which is hanging over an eroding cliff that could give out any time. 
 Homeowners don't know what to do with a house that is too expensive to fix, but could cost even more in fines if it falls. (Source: WTMJ/CNN) 
 It's too expensive to fix the problem, but letting it slide into Lake Michigan could cost them even more. 
 The couple that lived there moved out about a year ago after their side porch fell right into the lake. Now, about 10 feet of their home hangs right over the edge. 
 Severe bluff erosion has been an issue in Racine and Kenosha counties for several years now. 
 ""They had a beautiful home there at one time,"" neighbor Mike Gosselin said. ""One evening, the winds just came up, took it all off and the grounds just went. Now, it just keeps going further and further in."" 
 Gosselin has lived next door to the house teetering on a 50-foot cliff for more than 40 years now. He’s watched as large portions of the shoreline have fallen into Lake Michigan, exposing the home down to its foundation. 
 ""It's come in a good hundred feet or so already,"" Gosselin explained. 
 Rising lake levels creating big waves are to blame for the natural erosion. But those who have evacuated this condemned home find themselves in a difficult position. 
 Their insurance doesn’t cover earth movement, and they can’t demolish the house because they still owe $100,000 on the property. 
 ""They can't let it fall in the lake,"" Gosselin said. 
 If it does go tumbling down, they'll be fined for contaminating Lake Michigan's federally protected water. 
 “It’s an older home, so there’s going to be lead paint and asbestos and things like that,” Gosselin said. 
 Any day now, another direct hit by a big wave could make the decision for them. 
 “I’m really sorry because the insurance didn’t help them or anything. I’m still a good 50, 60 feet away, so I’m not too worried about it in my lifetime, but there are other people along this lake in far worse conditions than I am,” Gosselin said.

 The Latest: Court candidates appeal to convention Democrats 
 Jun 1, 2019 
 MILWAUKEE (AP) — The Latest on the state Democratic convention in Milwaukee (all times local): 
 4:55 p.m. 
 Liberal state Supreme Court candidates Ed Fallone and Jill Karofksy are trying to drum up votes at the Democratic Party's state convention. 
 Fallone and Karofsky are vying to unseat conservative Justice Dan Kelly in the 2020 spring elections. State Supreme Court elections are officially nonpartisan but Democrats and Republicans typically throw their support behind their favorite candidates. 
 Fallone and Karofsky spoke at the Democrats' convention Saturday in Milwaukee. Both signaled support for a host of Democratic planks during their speeches. 
 Fallone repeatedly stressed his Hispanic heritage. He said the Supreme Court should be a court for LGBT people and immigrants. 
 Karofsky said her kids benefit from public schools and her father was a pediatrician who believed everyone deserves quality health care. She added she's astonished that women's rights are under assault. She didn't elaborate but appeared to be alluding to efforts to restrict abortion rights.

 The convention gets underway Saturday afternoon at the Potawatomi Hotel and Casino. Evers will give the keynote address Saturday night. 
 His speech comes as Republican legislators are revising his state budget. They've already removed scores of Evers' signature proposals from the spending plan, including expanding Medicaid, legalizing medical marijuana and raising the minimum wage. 
 Also on tap to speak Saturday are U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and liberal state Supreme Court candidates Jill Karofsky and Ed Fallone. 
 They're trying to unseat conservative Justice Dan Kelly in the 2020 spring elections. The race is officially nonpartisan but Republicans back Kelly and Democrats support Karofsky and Fallone.

 Celebrities branch out with podcasts of their own 
 By ALICIA RANCILIO Associated Press 
 May 31, 2019 
 NEW YORK (AP) — Topher Grace has added a lot of skills to his portfolio over the last few weeks. 
 He learned to beatbox. He officiated a wedding with ""Shazam!"" star Zachary Levi, and even tried telemarketing. 
 He's doing it all for a new role, but it has nothing to do with acting: Instead, he's trying different things in his recently launched podcast called "" Minor Adventures with Topher Grace ."" 
 ""It really is more fun for me than anyone else,"" said Grace. 
 ""Tig Notaro came on and we did livestock auctioneering,"" he recalled. ""I was so bad at it. But, upon listening back I realized, 'It really doesn't matter if I'm good or not. In fact, it's kind of better if (the adventure) is outside of everyone's comfort zone.'"" 
 Grace is among the growing number of celebrities who are branching out to host their own podcasts.  Notables including Lena Dunham, Chelsea Handler, Alyssa Milano, ""Power's"" Omari Hardwick and ""Queer Eye"" star Karamo Brown are among those who've launched their own approximately hour-long, weekly shows this year. 
 And Katharine Schwarzenegger hosts a podcast about rescuing pets. 
 For some, it's a way to be creative outside of the medium where they are traditionally known. 
 Hardwick's podcast, on the subscription-based Luminary Network, is called ""Poetics."" It's dedicated to poetry, which is one of his passions.  At the end of each episode, Hardwick's guests must create original prose inspired by their conversation. It requires guests to dig below the surface and come up with prose based on their emotions and experiences. 
 ""We just kind of talk about their journey, their life and when they found a pen ... and where they see themselves going from that point on,"" said Hardwick. Guests have included Method Man, Big Daddy Kane, producer Rodney Jerkins and Dave East. 
 Others are using podcasts to call attention to things they care about. 
 Milano was looking for a way to bring attention to people who dedicate their lives to making change, but who aren't famous. 
 ""There are so many people on the ground that fight every single day ... and the only reason why I get (media) interested is because I'm an actress, and that's great,"" said Milano. 
 But, she wondered, ""How can I use that platform to empower others to make a difference?"" 
 Milano's new podcast, "" Sorry Not Sorry ,"" attempts to highlight those change seekers. She speaks to activists including Manuel Olivier, a father who lost son Joaquin in the 2018 school shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas high school, and #MeToo activist Tarana Burke. 
 Lauren Conrad, who gained fame as an MTV reality star but later branched out to write books, design clothes and take on other projects, has added podcast host to her list with "" Asking for a Friend, "" which features experts in various fields dishing on their work. Most guests are people she's worked with in the past. 
 ""I felt like this was a very cool opportunity to sit down and talk with each of these people about all the things they've taught me,"" she said. 
 Grace also appreciates how a podcast allows for a space to share more of himself, but still in a controlled environment. He's rarely appeared in tabloids and was never a paparazzi favorite. 
 ""I started to realize, 'Oh this is a way that I can share something that I love doing in my free time, but still I don't have to talk about anything I don't want to talk about, like family stuff."" (For the record, Grace does mention his wife and baby on the show, but everything is on his terms.) Others like to use podcasts as a way to share their talent of getting others to open up. 
 Karamo Brown of ""Queer Eye,"" says the success of the show has made people reach out to him for advice. His expertise on the series is culture, where he specializes in making people feel better about themselves. With his new podcast , Brown, who used to work as a social worker and psychotherapist, takes questions from real people looking for advice. 
 Brown says helping people find closure or to feel better, helps him: ""I literally feel better about myself, it's contagious."" 
 He believes people feel comfortable opening up to him because he's honest about his own past struggles. 
 ""I live my live very honestly and I talk about own challenges with drugs, alcohol, depression, relationship problems, parenting and dating. I've been through so many issues and so when I talk to people I can relate to them."" 
 ""Doctor Who"" star David Tennant uses his podcast, "" David Tennant Does a Podcast ,"" to interview celebrity pals including Olivia Colman, Jennifer Garner and Michael Sheen. 
 ""I love being in a room and just talking to people and seeing where it goes and then that's the finished product,"" said Tennant.

78655,"Army Corps of Engineers monitors levee at Bettendorf’s Leach Park 
 Posted 4:55 pm, May 31, 2019, by Luke Cleary 
 Email 
 BETTENDORF, Iowa -- The Army Corps of Engineers has been sending flood teams to monitor levees and flood walls around the Quad Cities. 
 At Bettendorf's Leach Park, flood area engineers spent part of the day Friday looking over the flood wall at Leach Park. Some water could be seen spilling from the seal of the temporary closure. 
 ""It’s coming through, it’s going into the sewer and it’s not ponding,"" said flood area engineer Kara Mitvalsky. ""So the system is handling it right now, which is OK, so this wouldn’t be a big concern. This might be something that we’d call up the city and say hey, you’re aware of this,"" she said. 
 There's also a smartphone app that the Army Corps of Engineers uses to flag potential problem spots. Concrete cracking or caving would raise concerns and call for a notice on the app, but the team did not see any of that happening Friday at the Bettendorf flood wall. 
 Meanwhile, Canadian Pacific Railroad has stationed a few workers to observe a section of the tracks around the clock. The Army Corps of Engineers monitors that section as well, making sure that the railroad workers have what they need in case they see a quick rise in the river level. 
 The railroad in downtown Davenport was closed Friday when the Iowa-American Water Company closed its flood wall over the tracks, returning parts of the riverfront, and Bettendorf's Leach Park, to the birds. 
 ""Normally this is a park where people are coming, and now it’s a park for the geese and the ducks back there,"" said Mitvalsky.",1

 hey @Phlog sorry but this thread is huge...i just want to know a few things about ostarine: 
 have you noticed any mental side effect? anxiety, changes in your mood, paranoia, over excitement or just feeling ""different""? anything at all? 
 im asking this because osta is a mild sarm and sarms are not supposed to have any mental effect...I GUESS.... 
 besides that, what other side effects you had? if any, off course? liver enzimes, gyno, etc...? 
 also, anyone who have run an osta only cycle, please feel free to answer these questions. 
 Also, there is any consensus about the safety of ostarine nowadays? 
 Thank you all very much.

 I'm trying out LGD 4033 at the moment. Was stacking with RAD 140 but found that was drying me out too much and causing tendon issues. 
 Only 2 weeks in but recovery is better, pumps more solid. Will update when done.

 I previously reported potential mental side effects, depression, anxiety, plus loss of energy, flu like symptoms. That happened first 1-2 times but there were other factors at play. Third time seems clear so I assume it was not the Ostarine. Using lower dosage than most, not seeing massive upside, hard to tell if there's any benefit.

 So @Phlog you said you did 25mg for 8 week cycles, right? And you're a bigger guy? I just got mine, I weigh 180ish lbs., am in my late 30s, and have literally never done anything stronger than creatine in my life.

 NEW YORK (AP) — The Jets have interviewed Seattle Seahawks executive Scott Fitterer for their general manager job. 
 The team's announcement Friday that it completed its meeting with Fitterer marked New York's first interview to fill its front-office vacancy. 
 Fitterer has been the Seahawks' co-director of player personnel alongside Trent Kirchner since 2015. He has worked with Seattle since 2001 and served in various roles, including as the team's director of college scouting. 
 Mike Maccagnan was surprisingly fired by Jets chairman and CEO Christopher Johnson on May 15 after four seasons — just 2½ weeks after the GM oversaw the team's draft. Johnson said he was looking to hire someone who was ""a strategic thinker"" and added that ""it's more than a talent evaluation guy."" 
 Head coach Adam Gase is the acting general manager and has an active role in the Jets' process of finding a new GM. 
 Joe Douglas, Philadelphia's vice president of player personnel, is expected to interview with New York over the weekend. He is largely considered the favorite to land the gig. Terry Fontenot, New Orleans' director of pro scouting, is also expected to be among the candidates to meet with the Jets.

 Canadian troops land at Juno Beach, Courseulles-sur-Mer, Normandy, on June 6, 1944. (CWM 20020045-1453/George Metcalf Archival Collection/Canadian War Museum) 
 It was, in so many ways, the beginning of the end of the Second World War. 
 But 75 years after D-Day, the significance of what unfolded after Allied troops came ashore on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944, still resonates. 
 ""I think we would be living in a very different world today if the German Nazi regime had continued to dominate so much of Europe as it did,"" Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan said in an interview from Oxford, England. 
 Of course, at the time, there wasn't any certainty that Operation Overlord would prevail. Despite all the planning that had gone on in great secrecy for more than a year, there was no guarantee of the outcome we know today. 
 Consider just how risky it all was, taking so many people and all that equipment over water to launch the assault that spilled more than 150,000 troops onto Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword beaches. 
 ""The Allies think that there's about a 50-50 chance that the divisions that make it onto those beaches are going to be alive at the end of the day,"" Tim Cook, historian at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, said in an interview. 
 Canadian soldiers study a German plan of the beach during D-Day landing operations in Normandy on June 6, 1944. (Lieutenant Ken Bell/Dept. of National Defence/Library and Archives Canada/Reuters) 
 Maybe the Germans would throw them back in the English Channel. Or maybe there'd be a counterattack in the coming days. 
 ""We know how D-Day turned out, we know it's the beginning of the end, but for those soldiers and planners it might have very well been the end,"" said Cook. 
 'Might have been a different story' 
 Other circumstances were at play, too. 
 ""Partly the reason D-Day succeeded is because something like half a million German troops were held up in the north around Calais,"" said MacMillan. ""If they had been down there in Normandy, it might have been a different story. So I think we should recognize that it wasn't a foregone conclusion."" 
 D-Day: The Allied invasion of Normandy 
 Among the Allied forces, about 14,000 troops were Canadian . Their target: the beach code-named Juno. Supporting their efforts were 110 ships and 10,000 sailors from the Royal Canadian Navy. In the skies, 15 Royal Canadian Air Force fighter and fighter bomber squadrons were doing their part to hold off the enemy. 
 In that joint effort, some history was being made, setting Canada apart from the other Allies. 
 ""It's one of the few battles where we have the Royal Canadian Air Force and the Royal Canadian Navy and the army fighting together,"" said Cook, author of 11 books on Canadian military history, including a two-volume history of the Second World War, The Necessary War and Fight to the Finish. 
 ""So you have Canadians from across the country who are here in all of the various units, and I think that there is an individual Canadian story that is perhaps different in that case than the British and the Americans."" 
 For Canadians waiting for word from the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, D-Day had its own resonance at the time. 
 ""For people at home, it marked, I think, what people came to see as the beginning of the last stage of the war. It was very, very important,"" said MacMillan, an author and history professor at the University of Toronto and emeritus professor of international history at the University of Oxford in the U.K. 
 ""The war had been a long slog,"" she said. ""Canadians had contributed hugely to the war effort … the public felt it, as well … there was rationing in Canada."" 
 New Brunswick's 'quiet' soldier honoured in Heritage Minute 
 Then there was the human, emotional toll. Most Canadians likely knew of someone — maybe a family member, maybe someone down the street or from the next farm over — who was involved in the war effort. Maybe they were overseas. Maybe they would come home. Maybe they wouldn't. On D-Day itself, there were 1,074 Canadian casualties, with 359 of those killed.

 Looking back now, D-Day may loom large, but it was only one day in the six-year conflict. 
 ""D-Day matters, it's a symbol, but the battle of Normandy will continue for —  it's eventually 77 days — and after that there will be another six, seven months of brutal fighting against the Germans,"" said Cook. 
 ""We must remember that D-Day, I think, over time has become a powerful symbol, but it is one part in a very long, terrible and costly war."" 
 Getting on with life 
 And after the war ended, maybe that wasn't something that people wanted to spend too much time thinking about. 
 ""I think immediately after the war, a lot of people just wanted to get on with life,"" said MacMillan. 
 Consider the Canada of the time, as D-Day grew more distant. 
 ""In the '60s and '70s and '80s, when we were a very different country, we didn't pay a lot of attention to our military history or to our veterans,"" said Cook. 
 Still, at some point, D-Day and the Second World War started to gain a bit more traction in the public psyche. 
 ""As time passed, I think people began to think back more,"" said MacMillan. 
 Authors and filmmakers mined D-Day for stories to put on the page or the big screen. Anniversaries that drew veterans and their families to those Normandy beaches focused attention on it once more. 
 ""I peg it as the 50th anniversary [in 1994] ... where we woke up as Canadians and we saw thousands of veterans around us being celebrated as victors as liberators,"" said Cook. ""I think it's from that point where we as a country began to pay more attention to our military history."" 
 This year's anniversary of D-Day seems to carry special resonance. The number of veterans still living is dwindling. Those who remember those first uncertain moments that day on Juno Beach are most likely in their mid-90s. 
 ""I think that this will be our last major anniversary celebration — or commemoration is probably a better word — with our veterans,"" said Cook. 
 MacMillan also sees differences among the D-Day anniversaries over the years. 
 ""This one will be, I think, a time of reflection, partly because President Trump is coming [to international commemorations next week] and the alliance that held for so long among the Western allies after the end of Second World War now seems to be under pressure, so I think there will be a lot of thinking about far we've come since 1944."" 
 An echo today 
 Depending on the country, the significance of D-Day varies, she said. 
 For the French, it's the beginning of the liberation of the country. For the Americans, it was a proving ground for their troops. And for Britain, it's something that has a unique echo today.",1

 NEW YORK — The Red Sox opted to shake up their starting rotation after Thursday night’s rainout at Yankee Stadium. 
 Chris Sale was pushed back a day and started the series opener with the Yankees on Friday as expected. Rick Porcello will start on Saturday and David Price will take the ball for the series finale on Sunday night. 
 Eduardo Rodriguez was the odd man out. The left-hander was initially scheduled to start on Friday, but he was available out of the bullpen instead. Rodriguez will likely make his next start to open a three-game series at Kansas City on Tuesday. 
 “We can get multiple innings tonight,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. “If we don’t use him tonight, he might give us one tomorrow. Hopefully we don’t have to use him.” 
 Boston’s bridge to the back end of its relief corps looks a bit thin at the moment. Josh Taylor and Mike Shawaryn had been summoned from Triple-A Pawtucket this week and Colten Brewer was also recalled on Wednesday. Only Shawaryn and Marcus Walden — who the Red Sox would like to use later in the game in a high-leverage role — seem capable of going multiple innings. 
 Price’s abbreviated start at Houston last Saturday and Ryan Weber’s four innings on Wednesday have left Boston scrambling a bit for coverage. Hector Velazquez (lower-back strain) and Brian Johnson (left elbow) both remain on the injured list and out of the roles they occupied last season. Johnson allowed two runs on four hits over two innings in his latest rehab outing at Double-A Portland on Thursday. 
 “The last 10 days we had the David situation in Houston and then we had the short one on Wednesday,” Cora said. “We had to go to guys early and often. It’s not easy.” 
 Back on track 
 The search for lieutenants to surround Matt Barnes in the Red Sox bullpen continues, and Boston might be circling back to Heath Hembree. 
 The right-hander has allowed a lone earned run and seven hits over his last 15 outings, covering 13 2/3 innings. Hembree’s 19 strikeouts in that span come thanks to a sharper delivery, and opponents are slashing just .146/.255/.271 against him. 
 “I think delivery-wise he’s more sound now,” Cora said. “Early in the season he was off — pulling off. He wasn’t able to control his fastball. The breaking ball was spinning in the zone, and you saw the damage.” 
 Hembree allowed at least one earned run in five of his first 11 appearances. Opponents hit him around to the tune of a .277/.346/.553 slash line and struck out just 10 times in 11 1/3 innings. 
 Pearce replaced 
 Both lineups remained unchanged from Thursday, and that meant a night off for Michael Chavis. 
 Brock Holt started at second base and Steve Pearce brought his 11-for-35 career mark to the plate against New York left-hander J.A. Happ. Chavis was just 1-for-9 over the last two games against Cleveland on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
 “We decided to give him one more day,” Cora said. “He’ll be ready to pinch-hit. I don’t want to tell (Yankees manager Aaron) Boone why he didn’t play. Sorry.” 
 Chavis has strong power numbers against left-handers, but he’s generally struggled a bit early in his career to hit for average or get on base against them. Chavis slugs 108 points higher against southpaws, but his batting average and on-base percentage are a combined 207 points lower. 
 As it turned out, Chavis didn't stay on the bench for long. He replaced Pearce at first base to start the bottom of the second inning. Pearce got one at-bat, a pop-up to first base in the top of the inning, then was pulled after suffering back spasms. 
 A work in progress 
 Tyler Thornburg (right hip impingement) sounds no closer to making a return from the injured list. 
 The right-hander has been sidelined since a four-game series at Toronto and has been spotted working with assistant pitching coach Brian Bannister. Thornburg last appeared on May 21 against the Blue Jays, requiring 40 pitches to escape the sixth inning of a 10-3 loss. 
 “Still working with his hip,” Cora said. “Working on some mechanics to see if that really helps him out. I don’t think he’s thrown a bullpen, but flat ground and working on mechanics.”

 Anyone who seeks a career in politics must first answer a difficult question: is my motivation in seeking public office to serve a higher purpose, or is it a naked personal ambition? 
 In reality, politicians must be both personally ambitious and committed to helping people other than themselves. The best politicians are those who keep both driving forces in balance; those who do not achieve such a balance risk losing their way. 
 This is the main challenge facing former Liberal cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott. Both were considered stars in the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Both resigned their cabinet posts to protest against political interference in a criminal prosecution involving Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. Both were ultimately ejected from the Liberal caucus for continued attacks on Mr. Trudeau and the Liberal party itself.

 There are many Canadians who are sympathetic to the cause as identified by Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott. The question is whether there are enough of them in two ridings — one in British Columbia and one in Ontario — to return the dissident Liberals as Independent MPs in the next Parliament. 
 The two MPs confirmed simultaneously last week that they would submit themselves to the mercy of voters as Independents after eschewing an offer from the Green party. The hill they must climb now to accomplish their re-election goal is very steep indeed. 
 The vast majority of Independent MPs are those who, like Ms. Wilson-Raybould and Ms. Philpott, were rejected by the party they represented when they were first elected. In recent history, only a handful of MPs has left the fold of a registered party and subsequently retained their seats as Independents.

11925,"Exhibits, panels, opera, more for Stonewall 50th anniversary 
  
 Deepti Hajela, The Associated Press 
 Saturday 
 Jun 1, 2019 at 8:01 AM Jun 1, 2019 at 3:30 PM 
 NEW YORK (AP) "" If it's Pride Month, there's gotta be a parade. And there will be, in New York City and places around the country and world. 
 But this year, the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising that fueled the fire for a global LGBTQ movement, there's also a lot more. From symposiums to movie screenings, walking tours to art exhibits, and even an opera, a slew of institutions and organizations are filling June with events that commemorate that moment and its impact through the past five decades, and also using it as inspiration for the current generation of activists to keep pushing for civil rights. 
 The uproar at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City's West Village, began on June 28, 1969, when bar patrons and area residents, tired of harassment that was still allowed by law, clashed with police officers who had come to raid the nightspot. Demonstrations continued for the next several nights. 
 Those events weren't the first resistance act of the gay rights movement, but it galvanized activism in the United States and around the world. 
 That history is all over the events that a wide range of institutions are hosting in June, from an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum called ""Nobody Promised You Tomorrow: Art 50 Years After Stonewall"" to an opera by British composer Iain Bell commissioned by the New York City Opera called ""Stonewall,"" which is getting its world premiere toward the end of the month. 
 There are walking tours, like the one from the New York City LGBT Historic Sites Project that will take participants around Greenwich Village and talk about the anti-gay climate that led to the Stonewall protests, and a panel discussion at a branch of the New York Public Library from transgender speakers talking about Stonewall and current trans life. 
 ""In the best possible world we would use these anniversaries, and I think it's happening this time, as a jumping-off point to look deeper,"" said Eric Marcus, founder of the Stonewall 50 Consortium, an organization that brought together cultural institutions and others primarily in New York City that have created programming connected to Stonewall. 
 It's not just New York City, as Pride festivals and parades are taking place around the country in June and beyond, and references to the Stonewall anniversary are everywhere. 
 In Raleigh, North Carolina, a month of events will include a ball celebrating those who resisted at Stonewall. At the Library of Congress in Washington, a display that went up at the end of May called ""Stonewall at 50 "" LGBTQ+ Activism in the United States"" uses flyers and other historical items to showcase protest history. 
 But for New York City, the anniversary has become the opportunity to take its already high-profile Pride celebrations even higher; Heritage of Pride, the organization that plans the city's parade and other events, has included a commemorative rally in its slate of events for the month, and is hosting WorldPride as well, the first time the international event has been held in the United States in its two-decade existence. 
 The confluence of all that has Pride organizers and city tourism officials hopeful that the throngs of visitors who come to take part in the various Pride activities over a period of about six weeks could double. 
 Fred Dixon, president and CEO of NYC & Company, the city's marketing organization, said the city's cultural institutions really responded to the anniversary. 
 ""We're proud of how many came forward and put together great programming,"" he said. 
 The spirit of protest that Stonewall represents is also represented in some events this month, including the Queer Liberation March being planned by the Reclaim Pride Coalition. 
 That group decries what it sees as the commercialization and corporatization of mainstream Pride events. The coalition's march is planned for the same day as the main Heritage of Pride march June 30. 
 ""There are members of our community who have always struggled, who have always been left behind,"" said Natalie James, co-founder of Reclaim Pride. ""What I think we want to go back to is ... the radicalism and solidarity of the early days of the activists in this movement.""

 WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google's business practices and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports. 
 The search giant was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action. 
 Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the company's search and other businesses, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Bloomberg News. They cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. 
 Justice Department spokesman Jeremy Edwards declined to comment Saturday. Google declined any comment. 
 Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., has faced mounting scrutiny as regulators around the world have focused on tech companies' business practices over the past year. In addition to the 2017 record fine, European regulators also slapped a $1.7 billion penalty on the company in March for barring websites from selling ads from rivals alongside some Google-served ads near search results. 
 Google says it has now ended that practice. 
 The company made changes voluntarily when the FTC shut down its investigation, including letting advertisers use information from their Google ad campaigns to create campaigns with rivals. 
 But an FTC staff report that was released years later showed that the agency staff had urged the presidentially-appointed commissioners to bring a lawsuit against Google. That never happened. 
 Google commands the lead in digital ad revenue by a wide margin, controlling 31.1% of global digital ad dollars, according to eMarketer's 2019 estimates. Facebook is a distant second with 20.2%. 
 Politicians and outside antitrust analysts have expressed concern in recent years that Google controls too much of the digital ad process. It makes the technology, hosts the largest search site where ads appear and collects data from all ad campaigns that it runs.",1
51540,"Tribune Opinion: Rural fire departments have benefited from oil and gas boom 
 Opinion | May 31, 2019 
 Greeley Tribune Editorial Board 
 An overhead view of one of the Galeton Fire District's engine bays. Bottom in the picture is a 2001 Type 1 engine the district picked up from a department on the East Coast. Next to that are a white 1986 Tender and a 1986 fire truck. The district has a new tender on order. It is keeping the older fire truck for events given the commnity's attachment to it. (Joe Moylan/jmoylan@greeleytribune.com) 
 RuralFire-GDT-052519-2 
 In the debate about the future of oil and gas, one thing rings true — there have been clear benefits to the residents of rural areas of Weld County, especially when it comes to public safety. 
 Briggsdale Fire Protection District Chief James Dilka vividly remembers the days when the department was a volunteer unit — a rag-tag one at that. In the early 1990s, Briggsdale had just three trucks to cover 400-square miles. 
 Now, the department has 14 pieces of firefighting apparatus, a roster of 25 volunteer firefighters and a cache of new equipment and supplies. 
 The money for this equipment comes from the tax revenue generated by the booming oil and gas business across Weld County. This year, more than 180 million barrels of oil will be produced across the region — a nearly five-fold increase from 2014. 
 That change has led to a boon for local fire departments, which saw increased funding, and that has led to a wave of professionalization in what were once small districts with limited resources. 
 The benefit to residents has been increased response times, including for medical aid and a higher level of service. Fire departments are also trained when it comes to fighting oil and gas fires or responding to incidents, but those have been few and far between. 
 “Oil and gas paid for all of it,” Dilka told reporter Joe Moylan. “Yes, oil and gas can be a pain — they chew up the roads and we have to respond to a few more calls — but they paid for all of our equipment.” 
 While the district has added equipment and has plans for a new fire station the district is debt-free. The same rings true for other departments. 
 Galeton has improved its staffing and saw dramatic improvements in its insurance fire suppression ratings. The improvements impressed the rating service, according to Chief Russ Kane. 
 “They said, ‘You guys used to be a shed and a few dudes, and now you’re trending in the direction of becoming a legitimate fire department’,” Kane told The Greeley Tribune. 
 Like Briggsdale, Galeton is debt free but also is cognizant of a potential downturn in the property tax boon generated by oil and gas. 
 “We’re creating an oasis, not an empire,” Kane said. “We’re trying to spend our money wisely knowing this is a cyclical industry. If we didn’t get a penny from oil and gas beginning tomorrow, we have enough money in reserves to maintain the same level of service for the next decade.” 
 All of this is good news for these departments and it certainly wouldn’t have been possible without the contributions of the oil and gas industry, but it’s also good news the chiefs managing this money are approaching it realistically with an eye on service to the community.

 The Idaho Press is counting down the 20 most important players for the Boise State football team in 2019. Next up on our list is No. 19, DeAndre Pierce: 
 Safety DeAndre Pierce experienced first hand how beneficial the new redshirt rule can be. Now the Broncos are hoping a healthy Pierce provides a big boost on defense. 
 Pierce suffered a season-ending injury to his spleen during the fourth game of the season at Wyoming last September. Since he hadn’t redshirted and only played in four games, he was able to save the year of eligibility and will come back this fall as a redshirt junior. The new redshirt rule that started last season allows players to still count the year as a redshirt if they play in four games or less. 
 Getting Pierce back on the field will be a major benefit for the Broncos after missing him for much of the year. Pierce and Kekoa Nawahine were mainstays at safety in 2017 and expected to be a solid duo last season. That was the case until the injury. 
 Pierce was Boise State’s leading tackler at the time of his injury with 23, and also had a sack and a tackle-for-loss. He had 12 tackles in the season opener at Troy and had the sack in the win at Wyoming before suffering the injury. 
 The injury was a big blow to the Broncos after Pierce was named All-Mountain West honorable mention as a sophomore in 2017 when he was fourth on the team with 83 tackles and also had 4.0 tackles-for-loss and an interception. 
 Tyreque Jones, Jordan Happle and Evan Tyler benefited with extra playing time in his absence, but there’s no doubt getting Pierce back this fall makes Boise State’s defense better. 
 And instead of entering his senior year with the Broncos this fall, the 5-foot-11, 180-pound Pierce still has two seasons left at Boise State — an unexpected boost to the Broncos looking ahead to 2020.

24617,"All but one of the 12 killed in the Virginia Beach shooting were city employees, official says 
 Posted: 7:17 AM, Jun 01, 2019 
 Updated: 2019-06-01 16:09:14Z 
 By: CNN Newsource 
 A day after a Virginia Beach city employee killed 12 people — including colleagues — in a shooting rampage in the municipal building where he worked, investigators are scrambling to nail down why it happened, officials said Saturday. 
 ""It's still a sense of shock, disbelief. Why did this happen?"" Bobby Dyer, mayor of the coastal Virginia city, told CNN, standing across the street from the multistory brick building where the massacre happened. 
 ""I guess the big question is why. We want to know, too."" 
 Authorities said DeWayne Craddock, 40, a certified professional engineer in the city's public utilities department, opened fire on all three floors of Building 2 of the Virginia Beach Municipal Center at the end of Friday's workday. 
 Craddock killed a dozen people and injured others, and sent terrified witnesses running out of the building or hiding under desks before dying at the end of a lengthy gunbattle there with four police officers, authorities said. 
 Eleven of the 12 killed were city employees. The other was a contractor who was there to fill a permit, City Manager Dave Hansen said. 
 Officials are now left not only answering questions about what happened but also dealing with the deaths of their colleagues. Hansen said he'd worked with many of them for years, and served with one in the US military in Germany. Dyer said the contractor was a friend of his who'd done carpentry work at his home. 
 ""They leave a void that we will never be able to fill,"" Hansen said Saturday before he read the victims' names. 
 Four others in the shooting were hospitalized, police said. They had surgery Friday night, and three are in critical condition, while one is in fair condition, hospital officials said. An officer was shot in the gunfight but survived because of his ballistic vest, police Chief James Cervera said. 
 Friday's massacre is the deadliest in the United States this year and adds the Virginia city to a grim list of places affected by a mass shooting. 
 Gunman fired through all floors except the basement, officials say 
 Officials said Saturday they were either searching for answers, or unwilling to reveal details, about what spurred the shooting. 
 A Virginia government source briefed on the investigation told CNN the shooter was a ""disgruntled employee."" 
 Craddock was a certified professional engineer in the city's public utilities department. He is listed on department news releases as a point of contact for information on local road projects over the past several years. 
 Cervera, the police chief, said his investigators still don't know the shooter's motive. He and Hansen declined to answer questions Saturday about whether Craddock had threatened anyone in the building previously or faced discipline at work. 
 The gunfire started at the end of the workday while people still were visiting the municipal center for business. He fired through on every floor except the basement as he moved through the building, officials said. 
 Officers gave the shooter first aid 
 Four officers confronted the shooter inside the building in what the chief called a ""long gunbattle."" 
 Two veteran detectives and two K-9 officers entered the building and began a shootout with the suspect. Cervera said they helped stop him from committing more carnage. 
 The gunman was wounded, and officers tried to save him, the chief said. 
 ""Even though he was involved in a long-term gunbattle with these officers when he went down, they did what cops do and they rendered first aid to this individual,"" Cervera said Friday. 
 The chief said that a .45-caliber pistol, a suppressor and several empty, higher-capacity magazines were found near the shooter. 
 Investigators have found ""additional weapons"" at the gunman's home, the chief said. 
 He was thought to have purchased the firearms legally, according to initial information investigators have, a law enforcement official said. 
 Co-worker describes encounter with Craddock earlier in the day 
 Sometime before the shooting Friday, a co-worker of Craddock's had a final exchange with him that amounted to ""have a good weekend,"" the colleague said. 
 Joseph Scott, who said he worked with Craddock for several years, saw him in a bathroom at work Friday. 
 ""He was at the sink, brushing his teeth like he always did,"" Scott told CNN. ""I used the bathroom and walked up and was washing my hands, and I said, 'How are you doing?' He said he was doing OK. 
 ""I asked, 'Any plans for the weekend?' And he said, 'No.' And I said, 'Well, have a good day,' and he said the same to me. 
 ""And it was no more than that."" 
 Scott said Craddock was ""what I thought was a good person,"" and described him as generally quiet. 
 ""When we were together, we would talk about family, friends, things that we were going to do, trips we were going to take and things like that,"" Scott said. 
 Many victims were longtime workers for the city 
 Hansen said the 11 slain city employees had worked for Virginia Beach for times ranging from 11 months to 41 years. 
 They were Virginia Beach residents Tara Welch Gallagher, Mary Louise Gayle, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A. Nixon, Ryan Keith Cox, Joshua A. Hardy, Michelle ""Missy"" Langer; Chesapeake residents Laquita C. Brown and Robert ""Bobby"" Williams; Norfolk resident Richard H. Nettleton; and Powhatan resident Christopher Kelly Rapp. 
 Also killed was the contractor, Herbert ""Bert"" Snelling, of Virginia Beach. 
 Nettleton, an engineer with the city's public utilities department, ""served with me as a lieutenant in Germany in the 130th Engineer Brigade,"" said Hansen, the city manager. 
 Lawmakers and activists respond 
 David Hogg, who survived the Parkland, Florida, school massacre, responded to the latest mass shooting with a short tweet: ""How many more."" 
 Local and federal lawmakers also expressed their dismay. 
 ""This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,"" said Dyer, the city's mayor. ""The people involved are our friends, co-workers, neighbors, colleagues."" 
 The city will help them go through the healing process, he said. 
 ""We're going to move forward as a city, as a community. We're going to be there for the families,"" the mayor said.  ""The people that were victims of this tragic event, they were family members, they were co-workers, they were a vital part of the community of Virginia Beach, and they will not be forgotten."" 
 Gov. Ralph Northam ordered all Virginia flags to be lowered to half-staff across the state until sunset on June 8 in memory of the victims, according to the Virginia Capitol Police . 
 In his first public comments on the shooting Saturday, President  Donald Trump said he had called Northam and Virginia Beach's mayor and vice mayor to offer condolences. 
 ""The Federal Government is there, and will be, for whatever they may need. God bless the families and all!"" Trump said in a tweet .

 Craig Varnell Wins 2019 WPT Choctaw Main Event On His 36th Birthday 
 Poker Pro Comes Back From Just Three Big Blinds To Win The Title and $379,990 
 by Erik Fast  |  Published: Jun 01, 2019 
  
 Craig Varnell had quite the birthday this year. The Coloradan poker pro took down the 2019 World Poker Tour Choctaw $3,700 buy-in no-limit hold’em main event, overcoming a field of 577 total entries to win $379,990 and his first WPT title on the day he turned 36 years old. 
 “It feels great,” Varnell told WPT reporters. “When I found out the final table was on my birthday, I said, ‘Well that’s good.’ And then the day didn’t start out too well. I was down to three or four big blinds. I don’t know what happened, I won a couple of all-ins and all of a sudden I was back in it. It was crazy. I had a big support group here. It was the best birthday present you could ask for.” 
 In addition to the title and the money, Varnell also took home 1,260 Card Player Player of the Year points for the win. The score was enough to see Varnell climb into 90th place in the POY race standings, which are sponsored by Global Poker. 
 As Varnell said, he didn’t get off to the greatest start at the final table of this event. Varnell had entered the final day in second chip position among the six remaining players. The final table was set on May 20 at the Choctaw Casino Resort in Durant, Oklahoma, but play didn’t resume until May 31 at the HyperX Esports Arena at the Luxor in Las Vegas. Varnell couldn’t get much going early on at the final table. He finally hit a big hand with K 
 6 
 , making two pair on a K 
 10 
 flop. He ended up getting all the chips in after a 3 
 turn, only to find out that he was up against the 10 
 10 
 of Nick Pupillo. Varnell had Pupillo covered but just over three big blinds, and that was all he was left with after the Q 
 completed the board. 
 Varnell then went on a double-up spree. In the next five hands, he was all-in and called three times. He won every one of those hands to rebuild his stack to 3,120,000 after being down to just 210,000. 
 Odessa, Texas nightclub owner Stacey Jones was involved in several big hands early at the final table. He won a preflop race to eliminate 2014 Card Player Poker Tour Choctaw main event champion Austin Lewis in sixth place ($76,890). Despite scoring that knockout, Jones was the next to be sent to the rail. He ran pocket kings into the pocket aces of Trung Pham to finish fifth for $100,850. 
 Will Berry started the final table as the chip leader. He had fallen into the middle of the pack as play continued but managed to right the ship by busting Pham in fourth place. Pham four-bet shoved with A 
 Q 
 for 3.4 million, only to get quickly called by Berry’s K 
 K 
 . The kings held up and Pham was sent home with $133,770. 
 With Berry and Varnell out in front, Nick Pupillo had fallen to the short stack for three-handed action. The poker pro had already made six final tables and won a title in 2019 prior to this event. His run came to an end when he called down the aggressive Varnell on a 7 
 7 
 , only to learn that Varnell had flopped trips with K 
 7 
 . Pupillo was awarded $179,430 and 840 POY points for his third-place showing, enough to see him catapulted into 12th place on the overall leaderboard. 
 With that Varnell took 14,250,000 million into heads-up play with Berry, who began with 8,825,000. It took just 13 hands for the tournament to be decided from there. In the end, it came down to a preflop race. Berry picked up the 8 
 on the button and raised to 375,000. Varnell three-bet to 1,175,000 out of the big blind with A 
 10 
 . Berry shoved for 7,500,000 and Varnell quickly called. The board ran out K 
 10 
 Q 
 K 
 and Varnell made kings and tens to secure the pot and the title. Berry earned $243,330 as the runner-up finisher. 
 Here is a look at the payouts and POY points awarded at the final table:

 Kids who nap are happier with fewer behavioural problems

 “Children who napped three or more times per week benefit from a 7.6 per cent increase in academic performance in Grade,” Adrian Raine, Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said. iStock 
 NEW YORK: Kids who take 30-to-60 minute mid-day naps at least three times a week are happier and have more self-control and grit. They also display fewer behavioural problems as compared to children who skip afternoon naps, says a study. 
 Published in the SLEEP journal, the study revealed strong connections between the afternoon shut-eye sessions and positive outcomes in a handful of areas in the overall development of kids. 
 “A study of nearly 3,000 fourth, fifth, and sixth graders ages 10-12 revealed a connection between midday napping and greater happiness, self-control, and grit; fewer behavioural problems; and higher IQ, the latter particularly for the sixth graders. The most robust findings were associated with academic achievement,” said Adrian Raine, Professor at the University of Pennsylvania in the US. 
 “Children who napped three or more times per week benefit from a 7.6 per cent increase in academic performance in Grade,” Raine said. 
 During the study, from each of 2,928 children, the researchers collected data about napping frequency and duration once the children hit grades four through six, as well as outcome data when they reached grade six, including psychological measures like grit, happiness and physical measures. 
 The research team also asked teachers to provide behavioural and academic information about each student. 
 They then analysed associations between each outcome and napping, adjusting for sex, grade, school location, parental education, and nightly time in bed. 
 “Many lab studies across all ages have demonstrated that naps can show the same magnitude of improvement as a full night of sleep on discrete cognitive tasks. Here, we had the chance to ask real-world, adolescent school children questions across a wide range of behavioural, academic, social, and physiological measures,” said Sara Mednick, Associate Professor at the University of California. 
 “The more students sleep during the day, the greater the benefit of naps on many of these measures,” she added. — IANS",1

 Teddy Greenstein: Urban Meyer, still adjusting to life after coaching, is as intense on the golf course as he was on the football sideline | The Sacramento Bee 
 Teddy Greenstein: Urban Meyer, still adjusting to life after coaching, is as intense on the golf course as he was on the football sideline

 COLUMBUS, Ohio 
 While coaching at Ohio State, Urban Meyer was a first-off-the-tee guy. He would motor through 18 holes as the sun rose over central Ohio, finishing by 8 a.m. 
 ""He goes fast – just like his offense,"" said Brian Kelly, the head pro at the Ohio State Golf Club. ""It's a 2-minute drill."" 
 So when Meyer arrived at the first hole (10th tee) at 9 a.m. for this round on the spectacular Scarlet Course, the legendary former Buckeyes golf coach Jim Brown ribbed him: ""Are you sleeping in now?"" 
 Not exactly. We planned to play a pre-breakfast 18, but the Monday storm that produced tornadoes in Illinois and Ohio caused a nine-hour O'Hare flight delay – and a 3:20 a.m. hotel arrival Tuesday. So Meyer took pity and we played nine.

 Meyer's main goal, other than to beat me out of a breakfast sandwich, was to prepare for the next day's Memorial Tournament pro-am at Muirfield Village, where the 10-handicap would be paired with Keegan Bradley. Thousands of spectators would be lining the fairways. 
 ""Just want to walk out without hurting someone,"" he said. 
 He left swarms of spectators happy Wednesday by autographing every item thrust his way between nines. 
 ""It feels weird,"" he said, ""to sign my name next to Rory McIlroy."" 
 Our round Tuesday began with him turning and asking, ""1996?"" 
 Yup, we met 23 years ago at a golf event to preview Notre Dame's football season. I saw that my partner was the Irish receivers coach and introduced myself. 
 ""You for us or against us?"" Meyer responded. 
 Hearing the story now, Meyer said that reply was ""pretty brazen"" for a position coach who had recently joined Lou Holtz's staff from Colorado State. 
 But that's how he is. With Kelly out of town, golf pro Rob Robinson was tasked with hosting Meyer for a round in 2016. Robinson showed up in a blue pullover. 
 ""What the (bleep) are you wearing?"" Meyer asked him. ""We're gonna hold off until you have something appropriate on."" 
 Coach Meyer will never be known as Coach Mellow. That applies to the golf course as well. 
 ""Go! Go!"" he hollered at a birdie putt left short. 
 ""Dog-GONE-it!"" he bellowed while looking for an errant tee shot. 
 And as we approached our drives on the 505-yard 12th, he examined a ball and asked, ""What are you playing?"" 
 Once he realized I outdrove him, Meyer said: ""Son of a (bleep). You got me. Wow ... (crap's) gonna change."" 
 With 240 yards to the flag, a breeze in his face and a creek ahead, he could not justify going for the green. 
 ""My younger days, I absolutely would have,"" he said. ""Like going for it on fourth-and-10 in the SEC championship (game)."" (He went on fourth-and-14 before halftime of Florida's 2006 victory against Arkansas.) 
 Meyer acknowledged that his transition has not been easy from coaching to his new dual roles as assistant athletic director for Ohio State and co-host of a new Fox Sports pregame show with Reggie Bush, Matt Leinart, Brady Quinn and Rob Stone. 
 ""I miss the players,"" he said. ""I miss the greater good, which is team. But I have the greater good too. Family, grandchildren."" 
 He shows a picture on his phone of daughter Nicki's children, Troy and Gray (full name: Urban Gray). The family lives across the seventh fairway from his home at Muirfield Village, the Jack Nicklaus-designed top-100 course that hosts the Memorial. 
 Younger daughter Gigi is living at home until she gets married in February. Nate is a freshman baseball player at Cincinnati, his dad's alma mater. 
 At 10:40 a.m. on May 14, Meyer received a text that Nate would be starting in right field against Northern Kentucky. First pitch was 11 a.m. The ballpark was 115 miles away. 
 Meyer immediately jogged down 10 flights of stairs from his office at Ohio State. He gunned it and arrived in the fourth inning, eventually shouting, ""Hey!"" so Nate could see him. 
 ""Big smile on his face,"" Meyer said. ""Worth it. That is eternal."" 
 As an assistant athletic director, he will court donors and mentor varsity coaches and team captains. He also co-teaches a business school class on leadership. Some howled when that news was made public, pointing to his handling of the Zach Smith fiasco. 
 Ohio State suspended Meyer for the first three games of last season after investigating his responses to multiple accusations of domestic abuse against Smith, a former Buckeyes receivers coach, by Smith's ex-wife. 
 Meyer fired Smith in July after Smith was charged with criminal trespassing in a dispute with his ex-wife, but the next day at Big Ten media days, Meyer denied knowledge of a 2015 domestic incident that police investigated without charging Smith. Meyer later admitted he knew of the incident and reported it to the proper channels. 
 While Meyer deserved the scrutiny that came with some of those mind-boggling decisions, that's not the part of his legacy that people here care about. They're more into the 54-4 Big Ten record, the ownership of Jim Harbaugh and Michigan, the 2014 national title, the victorious Rose Bowl finale and Meyer's emphasis on quality conduct from his players, an upgrade from his days at Florida. 
 Meyer, 54, said he stepped down primarily for health reasons. Despite undergoing surgery in 2014 to remove fluid caused by a cyst in his brain, he suffered debilitating headaches in 2017 and last season. 
 He revealed he could not even address his team after midseason victories over Penn State and Indiana. He said he would remain in a quiet room until they ""drugged me up"" with Toradol, a strong painkiller. 
 How is he feeling now? 
 ""Good,"" he replied. ""It's something I have to manage. I'm trying different things."" 
 Exercise is good. He and wife Shelley got in 20,000-plus steps the other day, walking the entire course at Muirfield Village. 
 And golf can be therapeutic. 
 ""He loves golf almost more than he loves coaching football,"" said Doad Edwards, the director of instruction at the Ohio State Golf Club. 
 ""I'm a little better at one than the other,"" Meyer deadpanned. 
 Despite lower back issues, or maybe because of them, Meyer has a non-taxing swing with good tempo. He can shoot in the 70s and made an ace on a long par-3 at the Warren Course in South Bend, Ind., while playing with coaches Greg Mattison and Bob Davie. 
 Meyer is good company on the golf course, asking playing partners about their lives and, of course, never slowing anyone down. 
 He also enjoys giving the needle. As I changed clubs before hitting my approach into No. 18, Meyer said to Kelly, ""Right now I'm so in his jug."" 
 On cue I pulled my 6-iron long and left, allowing Meyer's par to win our three-hole match. 
 ""The Tribune is buying me breakfast,"" he said triumphantly. 
 Turns out Meyer was playing hurt too. He needed two stiches in his left hand after a power-washing accident. He was cleaning his porch for Memorial Day when he lost control of the spray wand. 
 ""Blood everywhere,"" Meyer said. 
 Was that a stick-to-coaching moment? 
 ""No,"" he said. ""Stick to TV.""",1

 Pompeo Tells Germany to Tackle China or Lose Data Sharing 
 More 
 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo reiterated a threat to withhold information from allies if it is transmitted across networks America considers untrustworthy and there is a danger sensitive data will end up in Chinese hands. 
 Speaking in Berlin Friday, Pompeo urged Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government to “lead in taking action against Chinese corruption, espionage and unfair trade practices” and said the U.S. may have to change its “behavior” regarding intelligence sharing. 
 China is a “national security risk” to western democracies and the challenge is far wider than the threat posed by the use in communications networks of equipment made by Huawei Technologies Co., Pompeo said at a news conference after talks with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. He later had a 45-minute meeting with Merkel at the chancellery. 
 “We want to make sure the information doesn’t end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, it’s pretty straightforward,” Pompeo said. “We can’t permit private citizen data from the United States or national security data from the United States to go across networks that we don’t have confidence in.” 
 U.S. officials threatened late last year to shut Germany out of shared intelligence networks if Huawei was allowed to supply equipment for the country’s fifth-generation data networks. That threat, combined with issues such as potential tariffs on European autos and the Nord Stream 2 Russian gas pipeline, has added to tension between the two countries. 
 Germany has resisted U.S. attempts to persuade it to blackball Huawei and instead plans more stringent testing, oversight and approval guidelines that will apply to all vendors. Only a handful of countries, including Australia and Japan, have joined the U.S. campaign to boycott the Chinese company. Maas referred Friday to the German government’s “high security standards” for 5G networks. 
 “We will not be prepared give a positive response to firms that are not in a position to fulfill these security standards, completely independently of which company it’s about,” Maas said. 
 Pompeo was due to meet Merkel and Maas at the start of the month but canceled at the last minute and fly to Baghdad. After meeting Pompeo Friday, Merkel hosted Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan.

 ST. LOUIS (AP) - The Latest on the Stanley Cup Final (all times local):

 St. Louis Blues players say there’s a buzz in the city for the first Stanley Cup Final game here in 49 years. That view does not extend to Boston Bruins agitator extraordinaire Brad Marchand. 
 “Every arena has roughly the same amount of people in it, so regardless of where you are in the NHL in the playoffs, you expect it to be loud,” Marchand said after practice Friday. “I expect the same tomorrow, but not overly concerned about the fans. More concerned about the game.” 
 Marchand is the Bruins’ leading scorer in the playoffs and sealed their Game 1 victory with an empty-net goal. His antics in these playoffs include intentionally stepping on and breaking the stick of Columbus winger Cam Atkinson, and conducting a Canadian television interview with one- and two-word answers minutes after winning that series. 
 He and linemates Patrice Bergeron and David Pastrnak have no even-strength points so far in the series, but Marchand’s in fine form off the ice. Asked before Game 1 to describe his style for Blues fans who haven’t seen him much up close, Marchand quipped, “I don’t really care what St. Louis fans think of me, so not even going to get into that.”

 Patrice Bergeron once played a Stanley Cup Final game with broken ribs and a punctured lung. So it’s no surprise that he’ll be in the Boston Bruins’ lineup for Game 3 on Saturday night. 
 Coach Bruce Cassidy said Bergeron is in against the St. Louis Blues after not practicing Friday afternoon. Karson Kuhlman took Bergeron’s spot in line rushes and David Backes filled his spot on the top power-play unit. 
 John Moore in practice took the spot of injured defenseman Matt Grzelcyk, who is in concussion protocol and didn’t travel to St. Louis. Cassidy said Moore would probably take Grzelcyk’s place because they’re both left-handed shooters.

 2:15 p.m. 
 Two-time All-Star winger Vladimir Tarasenko is expected to play for the St. Louis Blues in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final after missing practice Friday. 
 Coach Craig Berube confirmed Tarasenko will play Saturday night against the Boston Bruins in the first home Cup Final game in St. Louis since 1970. Tarasenko missed a big chunk of the second period of Game 2 on Wednesday, which Berube said was an equipment issue not an injury. 
 The Blues will be without suspended forward Oskar Sundqvist and most likely defenseman Vince Dunn, who has missed four games after taking a puck to the face. Zach Sanford is the most likely option to replace Sundqvist, though Berube said Robert Thomas - who missed Game 3 with a nagging injury - is a possibility to play. 
 John Moore is expected to fill in for injured Bruins defenseman Matt Grzelcyk, who is in the concussion protocol and didn’t travel with the team.

 Vietnam memorial holds official opening 
 Jim Stover holds his grandson Christian, 2, as they look through the more than 58,000 names of service members who lost their life in the Vietnam War during a visit to The Wall That Heals on Friday at the Greene County Fairground in Paragould. The wall will be on display until 2 p.m. tomorrow, but visitors are welcome any time during the day or night until it is disassembled. There will be a veterans appreciation ceremony at the wall beginning at noon today. 
 BY GARY EXELBY, Paxton News Service 
 PARAGOULD — The Vietnam War touched everyone, from those who served, their parents and their children to their friends, classmates and those who survived them. 
 On Thursday, a ceremony marked the opening in Paragould of The Wall That Heals. The wall is a half-scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., designed to travel to communities throughout the United States. 
 Since its dedication, The Wall That Heals has been displayed at nearly 600 communities throughout the nation, spreading the memorial's healing legacy to millions, according to the traveling monument's website, vvmf.org. 
 ""I had relatives who served,"" Paragould Mayor Mike Gaskill said at the opening ceremony. ""I grew up during Vietnam, and I was expecting to have to go. But it ended before I got old enough."" 
 Gaskill added that when the wall's visit organizer David Hicklin approached him about bringing the wall to Paragould, he was all in. 
 ""I told him that whatever I can do, I will do,"" Gaskill said. 
 Gaskill said its the first time the wall has come to Paragould. It will remain at the Greene County Fairgrounds, open 24 hours a day and free to the public, until 2 p.m. Sunday. 
 At noon today, U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford and Greene County Judge Rusty McMillon will deliver Veterans Appreciation Day remarks. 
 The mayor said he had seen the actual wall, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, in Washington, D.C., and remembered to the audience a friend with whom he had grown up, Tim Clark. 
 ""He got killed at age 19,"" Gaskill said. ""And everybody has somebody there that they know."" 
 For American troops, the Vietnam War lasted from Nov. 1, 1955, to April 30, 1975 — just shy of 20 years. The mayor noted that in its early years, from 1956 to 1962, there were only 78 U.S. service personnel in South Vietnam. 
 In 1962, Gaskill said, there were 9,000 troops in the country. By 1966, the total had grown to 100,000 and by the next year, 500,000. 
 ""In 1968, we had 16,899 deaths,"" he said, ""and that was the worst year that we had."" 
 The mayor reminded the audience that 58,220 U.S. troops either were killed in Southeast Asia or later succumbed from wounds suffered in the war. 
 ""One of the things that we want to remember when we go out and look at the wall,"" he said, ""is that veterans are the ones who protect this country."" 
 Gaskill told the audience that: 
 • The youngest person who died in the war, Dan Bullock, was only 15. 
 • The oldest, Dwaine McGriff, was 62. 
 • More than 25,000 troops died in Vietnam at age 20 or younger. 
 • Eight women are among those killed in the war; the oldest, Army Lt. Col Annie Ruth Graham, was 52. 
 A total of 592 Arkansans died in the war, including 12 from Greene County of which eight were from Paragould. 
 Gaskill said the war wasn't just fought in Vietnam. 
 ""In Laos we lost 728 people,"" he said, ""Cambodia was 523."" 
 Ten service personnel died in the People's Republic of China during the war, he said, along with 1,120 in North Vietnam and 178 in Thailand. ""And we lost 55,661 in South Vietnam,"" he said. 
 ""Our local veterans who are here are the ones who wanted this done,"" he said, ""because they wanted to honor not only the people who gave their lives, but they wanted to honor the people who had the opportunity to protect us and knew that they might lose their lives. 
 ""The United States of America is the best place in the whole wide world to live because of what the veterans have done,"" Gaskill said.",1

 In Summary 
 In an interview with the Sun ahead of his visit to the UK, Mr Trump said: ""I think Boris would do a very good job."" 
 His comments came as Home Secretary Sajid Javid became the latest leadership contender to say he was prepared to leave the EU with no deal. 
 As the UK braces for Mr Trump's visit with a multi-million-pound security operation, he said he had been paying close attention to the Tory leadership contest, which will decide the UK's next prime minister. 
 He said Environment Secretary Michael Gove had been wrong to apparently criticise him over Iran.

 Donald Trump has said Boris Johnson would be an ""excellent"" choice for the Conservative Party leadership. 
 In an interview with the Sun ahead of his visit to the UK, Mr Trump said: ""I think Boris would do a very good job."" 
 The US President said other candidates had sought his endorsement, adding: ""I could help anybody."" 
 His comments came as Home Secretary Sajid Javid became the latest leadership contender to say he was prepared to leave the EU with no deal. 
 Writing in the Daily Mail, Mr Javid ruled out holding another referendum, an early general election or revoking Article 50 to end the Brexit process. 
 'VERY TALENTED' 
 Tory leadership: Rivals clash over support for no-deal Brexit 
 As the UK braces for Mr Trump's visit with a multi-million-pound security operation, he said he had been paying close attention to the Tory leadership contest, which will decide the UK's next Prime Minister. 
 He said: ""I actually have studied it very hard. I know the different players. But I think Boris would do a very good job. I think he would be excellent. I like him. I have always liked him. 
 ""I don't know that he is going to be chosen but I think he is a very good guy, a very talented person."" 
 The US president declined to reveal names, but said that ""other people"" had asked him for endorsements and added: ""I could help anybody if I endorse them."" 
 Mr Trump said he also looked favourably on Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, telling the Sun: ""Yup, I like him."" 
 MICHAEL GOVE 
 But he said Environment Secretary Michael Gove had been wrong to apparently criticise him over Iran. 
 Mr Gove said in an interview that ""sabre rattling of the kind that some have advocated is not the way forward"". 
 Both the UK and the US would benefit from pressure on the Middle Eastern nation, Mr Trump said, ""so he should be all for that"". 
 Having previously said he was ""surprised how badly"" Brexit negotiations went, Mr Trump told the Sun the UK ""allowed the European Union to have all the cards"". 
 ""It is very hard to play well when one side has all the advantage,"" he said. 
 He said the negotiators failed to put pressure on the EU, adding: ""They didn't give the European Union anything to lose."" 
 MEGHAN MARKLE 
 Mr Trump responded to comments made by the Duchess of Sussex, who has been critical in the past of the US President. 
 Ahead of the 2016 US presidential election, LA-born Meghan backed Mr Trump's rival Hillary Clinton and suggested she would leave the US if he won. 
 When asked by the Sun about the comments, Mr Trump said he had not been aware of them, adding: ""What can I say? I didn't know that she was nasty."" 
 But Mr Trump said Meghan would make ""a very good"" American princess, adding he thought it was ""nice"" she had joined the Royal Family. 
 The US President will arrive in the UK on Monday for a state visit, during which he will meet members of the Royal Family, including the Queen and the Duke of Sussex. 
 But Meghan, who gave birth to the couple's first child, Archie, in early May, will not be present. 
 PROTESTS 
 As with last year's visit, demonstrations against the US president are planned. 
 Despite the scheduled protests, the Mr Trump told the Sun he hoped he was ""really loved"" in the UK. 
 ""I don't imagine any US President was ever closer to your great land,"" he said.

 Residents' suit claims contamination from uranium plant site 
 Jun 1, 2019 
 Save 
 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — A federal lawsuit alleges that Ohio residents near a former uranium enrichment plant were exposed to radioactive contaminants that spread to other properties but weren't informed about it. 
 Several residents are suing over contamination from the site of the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon and construction of a waste-disposal facility there. They're seeking damages and medical monitoring through the suit against companies involved in work at the site. 
 The suit filed in late May seeks class-action status to represent residents within seven miles (11 kilometers) of the site and students at a school where radioactive material was found , prompting its closure. 
 Messages seeking comment were sent to the main cleanup contractor at the plant site and the company that ran a uranium enrichment project there in recent years.

98327,"KU theater student wins design festival, to visit Prague Quadrennial this summer 
  
 Saturday 
 Jun 1, 2019 at 8:00 AM 
 This summer, University of Kansas junior Kayleigh Shaffer will travel to Prague for free to view one of the most prestigious displays of design for performance, scenography and theater architecture in the world — the Prague Quadrennial. 
 Shaffer, a theater design major at KU, was awarded the honor for receiving a first-place national award for sound design at the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival. 
 She earned KCACTF’s first-place national award for sound design for ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"" a complex, large-scale production that was part of KU’s University Theatre 2018-2019 season. 
 In a news release, the KU theater department described the Prague Quadrennial as “a premier festival often considered the Olympics of theatre design.” 
 Shaffer and her composer worked for five months on the design for “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time."" 
 “I had to do research on the locations within the show and research on making an inclusive theater space,” she said in the news release. “With my composer, we did music research on Philip Glass, Erik Satie and Johann Johannsson, which we used for inspiration. It was four to six hours every day during the last month of the process for both of us.” 
 She says she shares this recognition with Matthew O’Brien, a junior theater performance and design major, who created the original music for the production. She and O’Brien attended rehearsals to get a sense of timing, movement and tone so the sound cues and music weren’t overwhelming for those in attendance or for any of the actors. 
 “We wanted to establish Christopher’s world and wanted audiences to feel that they were there with the characters,” she said. “Working with a composer was new for me. I knew from the first read-through of the show that I wanted to create the world as Christopher hears it, and upon the first meeting with the director we found out that we shared the same feeling on how the show should be heard. When Christopher was feeling anxiety or conflict, I wanted the audience to feel this way as well.” 
 To do this, Shaffer said, they sneaked in low-frequency noise that humans can't hear but can feel and low-sounding heartbeats that were more audible but created same effect. 
 “Everyone at nationals inspired each other in different ways. I loved being able to learn new things from other sound designers as everyone has a different work process,” Shaffer said. “I love that I was able to shed light on making theatre more inclusive for everyone as a whole.” 
 This is the second year in a row Shaffer has represented the Department of Theatre & Dance at KCACTF Nationals in sound design. This year she outshined eight other competitors in her category to earn the international trip. 
 Shaffer will be the sound designer for “Chasing Gods,” the summer theater production at KU, and for “The Christians,” which opens the University Theatre’s season in September 2019. 
 Other award-winners were Lexey Jost, a second-year MFA student from Hutchinson, who earned a national KCACTF Honorable Mention for scenic design for ""Spring Awakening,"" and Katelynn Schultz, a senior from Oskaloosa, who was a national entrant in the costume design category for “Perfect Arrangement.” 
 KU Theatre had the most representation of any university in the nation in the theatre design categories at KCACTF, according to Kelly Vogel, academic associate and resident at KU’s department of theater and dance. Shaffer said she credits Vogel and Ann Sitzman, technical coordinator for the department, for her success at the national festival. 
 The KCACTF National Festival took place in Washington, D.C., where students were able to attend workshops, learn from professionals and create contacts within the industry. 
 The University Theatre is a production wing of the University of Kansas’ Department of Theatre and Dance, and offers six public productions during the academic year. For more information about the department, visit theatredance.ku.edu.

 Named after King Arthur’s jester, Sir Dragonet (Epsom, 4.30) can prove his days of tomfoolery are behind him in Saturday’s Investec Derby . 
 In fairness to the formidable Aidan O’Brien operation, Sir Dragonet spent most of his early days at Ballydoyle mocking the system by hiding his abilities to such an extent his racecourse debut was delayed until April 29 at Tipperary. 
 One of O’Brien’s great strengths is identifying and nurturing talent from an early stage, but the son of Camelot was so under the radar at home that some close to Ballydoyle were touting him as a future Triumph Hurdle project further down the line. 
 Aidan O'Brien's Sir Dragonet can prove its worth at the Investec Derby at Epsom on Saturday 
 RELATED ARTICLES 
 Share this article 
 Share 
 Those theories were blown out of the water at Tipperary when Sir Dragonet burst on to the scene with an emphatic victory, but it was at Chester where he truly held court, slamming six rivals in the Vase with a show-stopping performance. 
 Some felt the selection was grossly flattered that day by his ability to operate on soft ground, and that may be the case, but his effort on the clock suggested he is no clown but a genuine Derby contender. 
 Admittedly, there are questions that must be answered this afternoon as a lack of experience and an ability to handle a venue like no other are valid concerns. 
 AIDAN O'BRIEN 
 Aidan O’Brien saddles seven of the 13 runners, but he had eight in 2007 when runner-up Eagle Mountain was his best finisher. 
 Victory for O’Brien would be a record-equalling seventh for Ireland’s champion trainer, matching Robert Robson, John Porter and Fred Darling. 
 Circus Maximus is a 24th Derby ride for Frankie Dettori. Lester Piggott (36) holds the record. 
 Sir Dragonet and Telecaster are trying to emulate 2013 victor Ruler of The World, the last Derby winner who did not race as a two-year-old. 
 However, Sir Dragonet appears to boast the natural ability and brilliance required from a Derby winner and, although connections didn’t view him as an Epsom candidate in early spring, he can vindicate the decision to supplement him for today’s feature at a cost of £85,000. 
 Perhaps the most seismic endorsement of his chance is the decision of Ryan Moore to abandon the likes of Broome and Anthony Van Dyck, both of whom boasted solid juvenile form before winning their trials smoothly. 
 Moore has partnered both on a number of occasions, both this season and last, yet is willing to jettison those relationships in preference for a spin on a horse he is yet to sit on in public, a decision which could be telling. 
 Of those at bigger prices which could outrun their odds, Norway makes some appeal even if he was left trailing in the wake of Sir Dragonet’s explosive turn of foot at Chester. 
 He can race keenly and is usually settled off the pace, so it seems unlikely he will be used as a pacemaker and the booking of Jamie Spencer seems a good move for an exuberant racer.",1

 Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon , CI, GCVO , GCStJ ( Margaret Rose ; 21 August 1930 – 9 February 2002 ) was the younger daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of the United Kingdom and the only sibling of Queen Elizabeth II . Margaret spent much of her childhood in the company of her older sister and parents. Her life changed dramatically in 1936, when her paternal uncle, King Edward VIII , abdicated to marry a divorcée, Wallis Simpson . Margaret's father became King , and her older sister became heir presumptive, with Margaret second in line to the throne. During World War II , the two sisters stayed at Windsor Castle , despite suggestions to evacuate them to Canada. During the war years, Margaret was considered too young to perform any official duties and instead continued her education. After the war , Margaret fell in love with Group Captain Peter Townsend . In 1952 , Margaret's father died, her sister became Queen , and Townsend divorced his first wife. Early the following year, he proposed to Margaret. Many in the government believed he would be an unsuitable husband for the Queen's 22-year-old sister, and the Church of England refused to countenance a marriage to a divorced man. Margaret eventually abandoned her plans with him and in 1960, she accepted the proposal of the photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones , who was created Earl of Snowdon by the Queen. The couple had two children. They divorced in 1978. Margaret was often viewed as a controversial member of the British royal family . Her divorce earned her negative publicity, and she was romantically associated with several men. Her health gradually deteriorated in the final two decades of her life. A heavy smoker for most of her adult life, she had a lung operation in 1985 , a bout of pneumonia in 1993 , and at least three strokes between 1998 and 2001 . She died at King Edward VII Hospital on 9 February 2002. Thanks for watching!

 Also Known As : Princess Margaret Famous As: Princess Nationality : British Birthday : August 21, 1930 Died At Age: 71 Sun Sign : Leo Height : 1.55 M Born In: Glamis Castle Father : George VI Mother : Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Siblings : Queen Elizabeth II Spouse/Ex-Spouse: Antony Armstrong-Jones 1st Earl Of Snowdon (M. 1960–1978) Children : 2nd Earl Of Snowdon, David Armstrong-Jones , Lady Sarah Chatto Died On: February 9 , 2002 ----------------------------- Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon was the second daughter of King George VI and the younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II. Born as Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret of York in her maternal grandfather’s home in Scotland , she became Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret when her father succeeded the throne after abdication of his brother, King Edward VIII . Educated at home under her mother and Scottish governess, she performed her first official duty at the age of seventeen, when she launched the ocean liner ‘ Edinburg Castle ’. Very soon, she began to involve herself with charities, eventually serving more than fifty such organizations as patron or president. She also made many official overseas visits, representing the crown on numerous important occasions. Although she was one of the most controversial members of the royal family, she was much admired by the public for her social glamour as well as for her dedication to the crown. ------------------------ Childhood & Early Life Princess Margaret Rose was born on 21 August 1930 at Glamis Castle, Scotland and baptized on 30 October in the chapel of Buckingham Palace by the Archbishop of Canterbury . Her birth was verified by the then Home Secretary , J. R. Clynes . At the time of her birth, she was the fourth in the line of succession. Her father, Albert Frederick Arthur George , the Duke of York , was the second son of King George V . Later , on the abdication of his brother, King Edward VIII, he succeeded the throne, becoming King George VI. Her mother, Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon , was the daughter of 14th and 1st Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne , Lord of Glamis . She wanted to name her younger daughter Margaret Ann; but later settled on Margaret Rose because King George V did not approve of ‘ Ann’. Born younger of his parents’ two children, Margaret had an elder sister named Elizabeth , who on their father’s death became the Queen of United Kingdom , Queen Elizabeth II. The two siblings were very fond of each other; but their characters were far apart. In 1932, when Margaret, lovingly called Margot, was two years old, the family moved to the Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park . They also had a town house located at 145 , Piccadilly , where they spent considerable time. Forward and intelligent for her age, Princess Margaret was a talkative and amusing child. Yet, there was a rumor that she was born deaf and mute. It was dispelled when in 1934 she made her first public appearance at the wedding of her uncle, Prince George, Duke of Kent . In 1935, Margaret, began her education under a Scottish governess, Marion Crawford . Princess Elizabeth , who was four years her senior, also studied under the same governess. Together they studied language, literature, history and music. Her mother also supervised her education. In 1936, her grandfather, King George V, passed away and her uncle, King Edward VIII, ascended the throne. But very soon, he decided to marry Wallis Warfield-Simpson, a twice divorced American lady , abdicating in favor of his younger brother, the Duke of York, who reluctantly agreed to become the king. As Duke of York was coroneted as King George VI on 11 December 1936, the family moved to Buckingham Palace. While Princess Elizabeth became heir presumptive, Margaret was elevated to the second place in the line of succession to the British throne . She now became ‘Her Royal Highness The Princess Margaret’. In 1937 , as the two princesses continued their education under their governess, 1st Buckingham Palace Brownie Pack was formed to enable Princess Elizabeth to become a Girl Guide . Shortly, Princess Margaret also joined the pack, which consisted of twenty girls from royal household and palace employees. As the Second World War erupted in September 1939 and children of well-to-do families were being evacuated to safety it was suggested that the two princesses should be sent to Canada. But their parents refused to send them to a safer zone while the country was facing the gravest crisis. Elizabeth and Margaret spent the first few months of the Second World War at Birkhall in Scotland, returning to Sandringham House near Sandringham, Norfolk to spend the Christmas . Thereafter, they moved to Windsor Castle , a royal residence close to London , where they spent rest of the war years.

 So I just re read your book and as a 26 year old female I can say if your looking for signs she is giving them to you. Her friend asked you that because they have obviously talked about it. Instead of sending roommate to wake you up She came in your room while you were sleeping and woke you up so you knew she was there. Again the shirt comment still stands. She is reaching out to you asking you to spend time with her. Try the shirt thing, maybe throw out a “hey you look really nice today!”  And watch her body language and expression to see how she reacts. Also report back, I’m invested now lol

 Woman to woman I’ll tell you that you know what’s right and what’s wrong. Never ever keep your mouth shut out of fear of retaliation because your valuable. You should never feel that sort of discomfort in any situation. If for some reason they do retaliate and fire you, good riddance. Know your worth 👏🏻 
 As a union steward I’ll tell you to collect typed and signed witness statements from others who have experienced harassment from this man. When it’s verbal it’s your word against his. It’s harder to deny a paper trail. I’m not sure where your located but Michigan has laws in pace for this sort of thing. If you report harassment and supervision fails to correct it you drop a letter to the state and they will come in and clean house. Print what you find and have it ready to present with the witness statements. Come to the table with facts and copies be well educated and ready to rumble.

 In a perfect world your right. I’d love it if every situation was truly equal opp. The fact of the matter is, it’s not. I’m a female boiler operator/stationary engineer. I was accepted into my apprenticeship only because of seniority. My boss made it clear he would have preferred a male and he tried everything he could to run me out of the department. Two years of hell and he slipped up in a meeting, said I had the wrong plumbing for the job. Shortly after he was asked to seek other opportunities. Iv come across some great people who accepted me into the fold and treat me like one of the guys. Iv had contractors think I was the secretary and ask me if there was coffee ready. Iv been told “it’s because your a woman” I have my integrity and I have my knowledge. All I can do is continue to give my best and prove I belong to anyone who thinks I don’t.

88722,"Trump tweets in support of LGBT people for Pride Month 
 But advocates for LGBT people say the Trump administration has been undermining nondiscrimination protections.

 President Donald Trump on Friday tweeted out his support for LGBT people to mark Pride Month. His tweets come one week after his administration moved to revoke newly won health care discrimination protections for transgender people. 
 That move was the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration that aim to reverse gains by LGBTQ Americans in areas including the military, housing and education. 
 In his tweets Friday, Trump says he wants to ""recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation."" 
 The president says other nations ""punish, imprison or even execute individuals on the basis of sexual orientation."" He says the U.S. has a ""global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality.""

 Support NRA-ILA 
 The NRA Collegiate Coalition at Western Michigan University recently wrapped up another stellar year on campus in support of the Second Amendment. The group, founded in 2017 by Grant Van Dorn and Cory Gardner, provides a unique and special opportunity for students. The group was started with the goal of providing a place for student Second Amendment advocates to gather on campus to discuss ongoing issues surrounding firearms and the shooting sports, but also to provide a casual and inclusive environment to welcome others to come learn more about NRA, the Second Amendment, and the gun debate. 
 Every week, the group hosted open meetings and events that often sparked controversy, but more importantly, conversation, on important topics. Guest speakers also highlighted the group’s activities, and this year’s distinguished guests included Scott Merlo, Chief of Police for Western Michigan University, and Dr. Edward Montgomery, President of Western Michigan University. 
 Shooting and training opportunities were also paramount for the group as they hosted various events for students at the local gun club to learn more about shooting and to refine their skills. They also worked within the community to promote the NRA Collegiate Coalition at Western Michigan University by attending local gun shows and working within the pro-gun community to garner resources in hopes of further building the group for the future. 
 Grant Van Dorn, current President of NRA Collegiate Coalition at Western Michigan University, and the entire Executive Board for the group, look forward to expanding the group on campus, and next year looks to be even bigger for NRA Collegiate Coalition!",1

 About Headset Drivers: 
 When headsets are connected, the operating system usually installs a generic driver that helps the computer to recognize the newly attached device and to use its basic functions. 
 Naturally, if you want to have all developed features accessible, proper software must be applied. This task also allows computers to properly recognize all headset characteristics such as manufacturer, model, connection type, and others. 
 Updating the driver version might improve sound quality, resolve different issues encountered throughout the headset’s usage period, provide you with new configuration options, and make various changes that enhance the unit’s stability and compatibility. 
 About Mouse Packages: 
 If an appropriate mouse software is applied, systems will have the ability to properly recognize and make use of all the available features. This will also allow users to configure any additional buttons. 
 In case you want to apply this software, all you have to do is to make sure all computer characteristics are compatible (such as operating system and bit architecture), get the package, and extract it if necessary. Afterwards, run the available setup, and follow the on-screen instructions for a complete and successful installation.  This will also make it possible for owners to configure additional hotkeys.

 Taylor Swift literally did not let a minute of Pride Month go by without taking a strong stand on LGBTQ rights. The pop superstar took to Instagram as the calendar turned over into June on the east coast to post an open letter to her Tennessee senator urging passage in the U.S. Senate of the Equality Act, a bill that has already passed the House of Representatives. 
 In a signal that she believes the buck stops in the Oval Office, she used her letter to Sen. Lamar Alexander to take issue with the White House’s position against the legislation, which has been opposed by most Republican lawmakers. 
 “I personally reject the President’s stance that his administration ‘supports equal treatment of all’ but that the Equality Act ‘in its current form is filled with poison pills that threaten to undermine parental and conscience rights.’ No,” Swift wrote. “One cannot take the position that one supports a community while condemning it in the next breath as going against ‘conscience’ or ‘parental rights.’ That statement implies that there is something wrong with being anything other than heterosexual and cisgender, which is an incredibly harmful message to send to a nation full of healthy and loving families with same-sex, non binary or transgender parents, sons or daughters.”

 Swift’s open letter to the senator was accompanied on Instagram by a message to her fans, which began: “HAPPY PRIDE MONTH!!! While we have so much to celebrate, we also have a great distance to go before everyone in this country is truly treated equally. In excellent recent news, the House has passed the Equality Act, which would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in their places of work, homes, schools, and other public accommodations. The next step is that the bill will go before the Senate. I’ve decided to kick off Pride Month by writing a letter to one of my senators to explain how strongly I feel that the Equality Act should be passed. I urge you to write to your senators too. I’ll be looking for your letters by searching the hashtag #lettertomysenator .” 
 GLAAD responded with a statement from president/CEO Sarah Kate Ellis: “In today’s divisive political and cultural climate, we need more allies like Taylor, who send positive and uplifting messages to LGBTQ people everywhere.” A message from the org on Twitter also thanked Swift for a “generous donation to support our work to accelerate acceptance for LGBTQ people.” 
 Swift revealed that she has “created a petition at change.org to urge the Senate to support the Equality Act. Our country’s lack of protection for its own citizens ensures that LGBTQ people must live in fear that their lives could be turned upside down by an employer or landlord who is homophobic or transphobic. The fact that, legally, some people are completely at the mercy of the hatred and bigotry of others is disgusting and unacceptable. Let’s show our pride by demanding that, on a national level, our laws truly treat all of our citizens equally.” She closed her message with a succession of rainbow symbols — an unsurprising 13, to be exact. 
 The singer’s letter to Alexander took on a polite tone, congratulating him for honoring the centennial of the 19th amendment, which allowed women the vote. “This was a positive step 100 years ago and I hope we can all continue to put aside partisan affiliations when it comes to matters of basic human rights.” 
 But she then took on what she considers a woeful record of LGBTQ protection in her home state. “I’m sure you saw where Amazon and almost a dozen other companies said they feel the proposed anti-LGBTQ ‘Slate of Hate’ in Tennessee would negatively affect their ability to do business in Tennessee.” She cited a study showing that 64% of the state’s residents support legislation barring anti-LGBTQ discrimination. “To vote against this bill would be to vote against the wishes of most Tennesseans and Americans. I respect your position in our country and your ability to really impact positive moves forward. … I, for one, would be immensely grateful.”",1

 5 ways to make your morning routine eco-friendly 
 Brandpoint (BPT) 
 Save 
 (BPT) - In a sea of plastic bags and exhaust-filled commutes, it can be overwhelming to remind yourself to be environmentally responsible and reduce your carbon footprint, especially during busy times like the morning. You slept through your alarm, the kids wouldn’t get dressed for school, your train has been delayed another 10 minutes — sustainability is often the last thing on your mind when trying to get out the door. 
 No matter how hectic your morning may get, consider integrating these five easy habits into your daily routine for small ways to make a big impact. 
 Shower smart. Replace showerheads and leaky faucets as soon as they begin to drip. Take advantage of fixtures that can reduce overall water waste. The EPA estimates that by replacing just one showerhead with a WaterSense certified model , the average family can save up to 2,900 gallons of water every year, or the amount of electricity needed to power its home for 13 days. 
 Turn off the faucet when brushing your teeth. While this might seem like a no-brainer, 42% of Americans report leaving the faucet on when brushing their teeth, according to a Google survey, which can waste up to four gallons of water each time. Colgate’s Save Water initiative estimates that every morning, we have the power to save up to 542 million gallons of water as a country with this small behavior change, based on U.S. Census data. Your water utility bill will thank you too. 
 Save your breakfast scraps. You may have to crack some eggs to make your morning omelet, but that doesn’t mean the eggshells need to go to waste. The idea of composting may seem intimidating, but there are several breakfast scraps, like coffee grounds and eggshells, that can enrich your garden’s soil as is. Sprinkle them in your flower bed to give your plants, and your karma, a boost. 
 Unplug your electronics. As you’re getting ready to begin the day, look around your house and consider unplugging any unnecessary appliances. The easiest way to reduce the amount of “phantom energy” that is likely contributing up to 10% of your electric bill, according to Berkeley Lab? Invest in power strips that you can easily power down before you head out of the house.

 Electric car batteries can catch fire days after an accident 
 New technology also is turning into a safety challenge for first responders. 
 Saturday, June 1, 2019 1:30am

 By Aleanna Siacon / Detroit Free Press 
 When a Tesla Model S crashed into a palm tree and caught ablaze just outside of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, last February, firefighters struggled to extinguish the flames and the car reportedly re-ignited multiple times. 
 Similar stories of electric vehicles bursting into stubborn flames have cropped up from Florida and California to Austria and China. 
 While electric cars are transforming commuting, the new technology also is turning into a safety challenge for first responders. 
 According to researchers, lithium-ion batteries are prone to a phenomenon known as thermal runaway — a process where battery temperatures sharply increase to the point where they catch on fire or explode. 
 Rochester Hills, Michigan, Fire Chief Sean Canto said the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has put together alternative fuel vehicle safety training for fire departments, which is considered “best practices” within the industry. 
 Those include: 
 Locating the car’s power source, and breaching the boxes/casing 
 Using copious amounts of water to continuously cool the car battery, in addition to conventional fire suppression tools and tactics (like firefighting foam) 
 Keeping the car away from structures after the incident, because of the danger of re-ignition 
 Still, fighting electric vehicle car fires can be tricky. 
 Auburn Hills Assistant Chief Antonio Macias said a big part of responding to roadway accidents is recognizing the vehicle and knowing where to access and how to cut the car’s power source. 
 For example, Macias said, electric car batteries are often placed in “inconspicuous places,” which can be difficult for first responders to access. He added that firefighting foam isn’t effective unless it’s able to penetrate the car battery’s case. 
 Royal Oak Fire Chief David Cummins said first responders use mobile apps that can help them quickly learn how to locate and properly disable a car’s power sources. Among them, he said, is the NFPA/Moditech AFV EFG (Alternative Fuel Vehicle Emergency Field Guide). 
 Alfie Green, chief of training for the Detroit Fire Department, said mobile apps are a huge help, especially because the color of the wiring in cars hasn’t been standardized. 
 Green said the city focuses on training to keep firefighters up to date on the latest “idiosyncrasies” with various car models. 
 The biggest tool in fighting electric vehicle fires is the most basic: water. 
 But it takes lots of it — “copious amounts,” Macias said. 
 The response is needed, he said, because the batteries need to be cooled to keep them from re-igniting. 
 “You don’t want to mix water and batteries, but unfortunately this is where you got to go,” Macias said. 
 Cummins said that while the hazards involved in responding to an electric vehicle aren’t dissimilar to an ordinary car fire, these batteries pose a unique challenge. 
 “The one marked difference would be that if the batteries are involved, some metals in the batteries may react violently with water,” Cummins said. 
 What’s important, Wells said, is to fight any car fires from a safe distance and to “take extreme caution” with any electric hazards. 
 As technology evolves, fire officials said, it’s crucial that departments keep a dialogue with automakers regarding vehicle safety. 
 In Auburn Hills, Macias said his department received product-specific emergency response guidelines — specifically, PowerPoints about self-driving vehicles. 
 “The more that we can work together and give them ideas about how we might be able to mitigate the incident without causing them more cost on production … the safer we will be,” Macias said.",1

 It was a tragic day for Virginia Beach residents after the city was rocked by a deadly shooting on Friday. 
 According to CBS News , 11 people were killed and six were wounded after a disgruntled employee of the Public Utilities Department opened fire inside a municipal building. The gunman died after a gunfire exchange with police. 
 Upon hearing news of the tragic incident, Pharrell Williams, Pusha-T and many other celebrities took to social media to send their love to the victims and their family and friends. 
 ""We are praying for our city, the lives that were lost, their families and everyone affected,"" the ""Happy"" singer began. ""We are resilient. We will not only get through this but we’ll come out of this stronger than before we always do. #VIRGINIABEACH 🌍.""

 How F’ked Up is it that every schmuck with a grudge can accumulate enough fire power to wreak havoc? #VirginiaBeach 
 This is heartbreaking and horrifying. 💔 This has to end. #VirginiaBeach https://t.co/gEoMRWB9YS 
 Numerous states have draconian laws that regulate women’s bodies but somehow sensible gun control is SUPER hard to implement. Realize that they aren’t really pro-life at all. 
 Saddened to hear of yet ANOTHER mass shooting. Eleven dead, six injured this time in #VirginiaBeach #SMH 
 Praying for the families and loved ones of the victims of today’s mass shooting in Virginia Beach. What a horrific day for America. Things have got to change. 🙏🏻 
 Our hearts are broken for the people of Virginia Beach, a community devastated by a senseless act of violence. We send our deepest sympathies to the families of the victims. 
 The mass shootings aren’t ever going to stop unless we want them to. 
 Jane and I are grieving for the victims in Virginia Beach and their families. 
 The days of the NRA controlling Congress and writing our gun laws must end. Congress must listen to the American people and pass gun safety legislation. This sickening gun violence must stop. https://t.co/iSAtYWg7HH

 $475 MILLION: Mega Millions lottery jackpot swells 
 $475 MILLION: Mega Millions lottery jackpot swells 
 Jun 1, 2019, 11:07 am 
 16th-largest jackpot in US lottery history 
 By Todd Northrop 
 After 23 drawings without a jackpot winner, the multi-state Mega Millions lottery game now boasts a swelling jackpot of nearly a half-billion dollars that could instantly put someone among the wealthiest people on the planet. 
 When nobody won Friday night's grand prize, the Mega Millions jackpot grew to an estimated $475 million — the biggest since a $1.537 billion Mega Millions jackpot from the October 23, 2018 drawing crowned a single anonymous lottery winner from South Carolina as the world's first lottery billionaire. (See Winner of $1.5 billion Mega Millions jackpot has come forward , Lottery Post, Mar. 4, 2019.) 
 The next Mega Millions drawing is on Tuesday night at 11:00 pm Eastern Time (8:00 pm Pacific). 
 Tuesday's $475 million Mega Millions jackpot is the 7th-largest in the game's history, and the 16th-largest United States lottery jackpot of all time (see full list below). 
 The lump-sum cash value of $307 million is also 16th-largest on the all-time US lottery jackpot cash value list. 
 Note that Lottery Post's top-25 US lottery jackpot list now includes the number of rollovers that the jackpot went through to reach the final number, as well as the starting point of the jackpot. 
 The current jackpot run-up started on March 15 as a $40 million grand prize — it has been 2½ months since Mega Millions has had a jackpot winner. 
 Lottery players wondering what all the cash will look like in their bank account after federal and state taxes are taken out can see an after-tax analysis of the current Mega Millions jackpot by visiting USA Mega's  Jackpot Analysis  page. 
 The rush of ticket sales over the next few days likely will propel the jackpot to an even higher amount before the drawing takes place Tuesday. Lottery Post and USA Mega will update the jackpot tallies displayed if such an increase occurs. 
 If you're not sure where to buy your tickets, head right over to the  Lottery Places  website to download the free app on your iOS or Android phone or Windows computer. Lottery Places is the only app on the market that will locate lottery retailers in every state and jurisdiction throughout the United States. 
 Michigan lottery players can bypass the store completely and buy Mega Millions lottery tickets online .  Players outside the USA can play online through a reputable butler service that delivers scanned images of the lottery tickets to verify the ticket purchase and ownership. 
 Lottery players across the United States are also watching and playing Powerball for its swelling $350 million jackpot, due to be drawn tonight. Despite its massive size, Powerball still hasn't broken into the top 25 list, and is currently sitting at number 33. To make the top 25 list, a jackpot now has to be $421 million or more. 
 In Friday night's Mega Millions drawing, there was no jackpot winner, but 2 lucky players from New Jersey and New York matched the first 5 numbers for a second-prize win. 
 Neither player purchased their ticket with the Megaplier option for an extra $1 per play.  If they had, their prize would have been increased to $3 million, because the Megaplier number drawn was 3.  By law, California awards all lottery prizes on a pari-mutuel basis, meaning the prizes will change each drawing based on the number of tickets sold and the number of tickets that won at each prize level. 
 Also, a total of 38 tickets matched four of the first five numbers plus the Mega Ball to win a $10,000 prize. Of those tickets, 5 were purchased with the Megaplier option, increasing the prize to $30,000, and 3 were sold in California, where the prize awarded this drawing is $14,581. 
 The Mega Millions winning numbers for Friday, May 31, 2019, were 7, 8, 26, 65, and 67, with Mega Ball number 4. The Megaplier number was 3. 
 Following the Friday drawing, the Mega Millions annuity jackpot estimate was raised $31 million from its previous amount of $444 million. The cash value was raised by $25.9 million from its previous amount of $281.1 million. 
 Additional information about the drawing, including all prize payout information and drawing video, can be found on USA Mega's Mega Millions drawing detail for May 31, 2019 page. 
 Mega Millions is currently offered for sale in 44 states, plus Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Drawings are Tuesdays and Fridays at 11:00 pm Eastern Time. Tickets cost $2 each. 
 The Mega Millions winning numbers are published at USA Mega ( www.usamega.com ) minutes after the drawing takes place.

92014,"Shribman's view: Things don't change, until they do 
 Commentary David M. Shribman 
 12 hrs ago 
 NEWPORT CENTER, Vermont — There's an important political lesson here in the soft green hills of this state. 
 Over centuries, Vermont has held to its traditions. Its communities govern themselves through town meetings in the slushy first week of March, when often it is treacherous to venture outside. Its governors face the voters every two years, a departure from 48 other states that have four-year terms. 
 Its citizens revere higher education, even though the number of Vermont high school seniors is in such steep decline that only one out of five students at the state university is actually from Vermont. Its prevailing ethos, dating from Ethan Allen and his 18th-century Green Mountain Boys, is independence. 
 And, until recently, its inclination was a flinty conservatism, and its devout loyalty was to the Republican Party. 
 That's evaporated, along with much of Vermont's singular language and Yankee aphorisms. A Vermonter who ""pestled around"" was acting hastily, while someone who ""trotted around all day in a bushel"" spent a busy day making no progress. 
 And around here, on Canada's front door, where Lake Memphremagog shimmers in the sunshine of late spring, someone standing apart from the crowd was ""like a blackberry in a pan of milk,"" and a poor, tired hired man— an occupational category used today only when schoolchildren recite a 1914 Robert Frost poem — might be described as ""looking for salt pork and sundown."" 
 In the first 34 presidential elections since the Republican Party's founding, Vermont deviated from the party only in the 1964 Lyndon Johnson landslide. The state voted for the first Republican presidential candidate, John C. Fremont, in 1856, and didn't vote for a Democratic presidential candidate, governor or member of Congress for almost a century. 
 Now, Vermont has voted Democratic seven presidential elections in a row, its onetime governor was the Democratic presidential front-runner briefly in 2004 and later served as national party chairman, and its socialist senator is a leading presidential candidate. 
 Here, in a Northeast Kingdom town settled in 1781 and with a population of 1,511, an important point with vast significance for American politics is clear: 
 No state is in an unvarying political state. 
 For a time, Vermont seemed that way. ""This place was 100 percent Republican for so long that the old-timers wouldn't recognize our politics today,"" said Peter Gilbert, former executive director of the Vermont Humanities Council. ""But we're not all Democrats or socialists up here. Our governorship now alternates between the parties, and it tends to go to the candidate who is more likable."" 
 Today Vermont — which produced Republican Presidents Chester Arthur and Calvin Coolidge and was, in the words of emeritus University of Vermont historian Garrison Nelson, ""far and away the most successful Republican state in the country"" — is a solidly Democratic state in presidential elections. But several states are in transition. 
 These transitions often have shaped American history. The transformation of the 11 states of the Old Confederacy from the Solid South of the Democrats to the Solid South of the Republicans eroded one party's national base and created the base of the other. Democrat William Jennings Bryan swept the region three times, Woodrow Wilson did it twice, and Franklin Roosevelt did it four times. 
 But there was erosion under Harry Truman (who lost four of the states in 1948) and again under Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and 1956, and by the time John Kennedy ran in 1960, the region was increasingly competitive. 
 The Southerner Lyndon Johnson, who signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act, lost five Southern states to Barry Goldwater; and Richard Nixon, who ran a ""Southern Strategy,"" split the area with former Gov. George Wallace of Alabama, an independent candidate. By Ronald Reagan's time, a new, Republican Solid South was firmly established. 
 Now several states are in transition. Arizona, which has voted for a Republican presidential candidate 16 of the last 17 elections, could move to the Democratic column soon. North Carolina, which has given its electoral votes to a Democrat only twice since 1968, could do the same in the near future. Texas, too. 
 And though Minnesota — home of Democratic presidential nominees Hubert H. Humphrey (1968) and Walter F. Mondale (1984) -- is regarded as a sturdy part of the Democratic calculus, it increasingly is a serious Republican target. 
 Even if it does not flip in 2020, Minnesota has undergone a remarkable internal transition: Onetime Republican suburbs now are congenial to the Democrats, and onetime Democratic-Farmer-Labor strongholds in the Iron Range and the rural southern part of the state increasingly are comfortably Republican. 
 This is not to say that regional characteristics have disappeared in contemporary America, with its ingrained geographic mobility and mass-media influence. Some qualities remain the same. 
 Take this one, from John Gunther's classic ""Inside U.S.A.,"" a 1947 bestseller: ""Vermont has smooth and gentle dulcet hills — yes. But underneath is slate, marble, granite. This granite is solid in the state character. Hit a man with an ax; he will practically chip off like a block of stone."" 
 Gunther employed the word ""man,"" but the state has been a leader in electing female public officials, with a mid-20th-century organization called the OWLS (Vermont Order of Women Legislators) promoting women in politics; with the first elected female lieutenant governor in the nation, Consuelo Northrop Bailey, taking office in 1955; with Madeleine Kunin serving as governor from 1985 to 1991; and with about 40 percent of the state's General Assembly being female. 
 Robert Frost, who moved to this state in 1920 ""to seek a better place to farm and especially grow apples,"" was peculiarly resistant to change, once noting (in a poem titled ""New Hampshire"") that ""Vermont mountains stretch extended straight."" 
 But Frost also understood change. Take his poem ""Nothing Gold Can Stay,"" written in 1923 and published in a collection awarded the Pulitzer Prize. 
 Critics have noted the poem's allusions to Eden and to the fall, but what applies in the political context is the immutable notion of change. ""Nature's first green is gold,"" the poet said in the opening line, a reference to the color of new leaves; that tint, he explains in the second line, is the leaf's ""hardest hue to hold."" For soon the gold will turn to green because, in nature as in politics, ""Nothing gold can stay."" 
 Some things are constants in American politics — until they aren't anymore. That's the lesson of Frost, and of Vermont. 
 North Shore native and Pulitzer Prize winner David M. Shribman is the former executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

56438,"Michael Hiltzik: As was predicted, Uber's IPO means you'll be paying higher fares for your rides 
 news 1 day ago Los Angeles Times — By Michael Hiltzik Los Angeles Times 
 May 31--     Uber's first-quarter earnings report released Thursday-its first since the ride-sharing company went public on May 10-disclosed more than the financial condition of the company. 
 It also opened a window on the economic reality of the ride-sharing business. In discussing that reality, Uber executives revealed something that always percolated in the background about its business: Once Uber went public, its subsidized pricing would disappear. 
 That could create a new headwind for the company's growth, which in any case has been slowing, according to the earnings release. As we've reported before, Uber's success has been based on two unsustainable tactics: subsidizing fares and exploiting drivers. 
 During their conference call with investment analysts following the company's earnings release Thursday, Uber's leadership didn't say explicitly that fares would be rising. But they gave a loud and clear signal. ""We expect to deploy fewer consumer promotions in Q2 of 2019,"" Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai said. Translation: lower subsidies for riders. 
 Following that statement, Uber shares gained in trading after the stock market's close. The bump-up carried over to Friday, with the shares gaining 70 cents, or 1.76%, to $40.50 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 As for the company's bottom line, it's unhealthy. Uber reported a quarterly loss of $1.01 billion. Its ""adjusted EBITDA,"" an earnings metric it utilized during its private years, fell to a loss of $869 million, worse than the $817 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 Chai's promise and the trading pattern show that public investors will be taking a much harsher view of Uber's marketing expenditures than did the private venture investors who have been providing the company with its capital up to now. This new reality applies to other ride-sharing companies, including Lyft, which went public a few weeks before Uber. 
 Let's take a closer look at the structure of this business, as elucidated by the Uber disclosures. During the company's private-market phase, its venture investors showered Uber with cash to fund what arguably was predatory pricing-Uber trips were priced at a discount to its traditional competition, taxis, to gain market share. 
 The harvest came in the form of unrelenting losses reaching more than $3 billion in 2018 alone. Investors were willing to swallow that red ink on the expectation that it would give the company a dominant position in its markets, allowing it eventually to set fares high enough to generate profits. They assumed that any losses they incurred would be made up in the IPO down the line. 
 Public investors aren't nearly as patient or forgiving. They respond to results in the here and now. Unlike the venture investors, they don't have an IPO as an exit strategy-they came in after the IPO. Moreover, unlike the venture gang, whose sentiment about the company can be hard to gauge, the public investors' sentiment can be followed in real time via the stock price. Any CEO who ignores the electrocardiogram of stock trades for long is putting his career at risk. 
 The extent of Uber's fare subsidy has been the topic of debate for years. Transportation industry expert Hubert Horan, writing at nakedcapitalism.com in 2016, calculated that riders were paying only 41% of the cost of their trips. He asked how Uber would keep their business if fares had to more than double to allow the company to break even. 
 ""Uber's growth to date is entirely explained by its willingness to engage in predatory competition funded by Silicon Valley billionaires pursuing industry dominance,"" Horan observed. 
 Once that well ran dry, fares would rise, and one of Uber's selling points-its price advantage compared to taxicab service-would narrow or disappear. Chai signaled on Thursday that the moment is now just over the horizon. 
 Uber's earnings report suggests that it's caught in a financial vise. Its gross bookings, which measure what customers spend, increased to $14.7 billion in the first quarter, a rise of 34%. But the growth was 37% in the fourth quarter and 41% a year earlier. 
 Yet Chai attributed the rise to ""increased consumer promotions as well as increased advertising and marketing head count."" By stating that the promotional spending would ebb, he implicitly raised the question of how that would affect overall revenue. The smart money would say that the impact won't be positive.

 JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Former U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran was a master of the federal budget process, quietly shrugging off criticism about pork-barrel spending while directing billions of dollars back to his home state of Mississippi. 
 Cochran died Thursday at age 81. He was the 10th longest-serving senator in U.S. history and wielded power for several years as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
 Through federal spending in what has long been one of the poorest states in the nation, Cochran leaves a legacy that's visible in many ways, including catfish on dinner plates and Navy ships on the seas. 
 Several buildings in Mississippi bear his name, including a federal courthouse in Jackson, agricultural research centers in Stoneville and Poplarville, a pharmaceutical research building at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, a conference center at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, and a research park at Mississippi State University in Starkville. 
 There's even a variety of rice named ""Thad,"" in his honor. The USA Rice Federation said the name was given by employees at Mississippi State University's Agricultural and Forestry Experimentation Station. 
 In the rural flatlands of the Delta, Jimmy Avery is director of the Thad Cochran National Warmwater Aquaculture Center, which is part of the Delta Research and Extension Center in Stoneville. The aquaculture center's work focuses on genetics, water quality, and fish health to try to improve production for farm-raised catfish. 
 Avery said Cochran's name and photo are on a wall, and he and other scientists used to meet with the senator in Washington. Avery said Cochran was well versed on agriculture issues and asked informed questions about their work, including how foreign competition affects the catfish industry. 
 ""He was responsible for a very wise investment here in Mississippi at a time when a lot of other states were not making investments in aquaculture,"" Avery said Friday. 
 During his final election in 2014, Cochran faced harsh criticism from Republican primary challenger Chris McDaniel, a state senator with tea party support. McDaniel said Cochran's spending habits had increased the federal debt to a dangerous level. 
 Cochran told The Associated Press that the federal government had a large federal debt and ""I think that is a danger to continued economic growth and prosperity,"" so officials had to be cautious. 
 Cochran continued: ""A certain amount of debt is acceptable, I think. And the experts provide testimony at hearings every year when we're reviewing federal requests from the federal government for spending funds to continue to operate their departments.""

 1 hr ago 
 National Accordion Awareness Month is June. Can you believe there needs to be a month designated to make people aware of accordions? Aren’t we all familiar with that particular musical instrument? Hasn’t everyone heard a polka? 
 I first heard an accordion when I was at my grandmother’s house and we watched “The Lawrence Welk Show,” as happened on a regular basis there. 
 The bouncy sound of it drew me in. It was happy and energetic. I couldn’t resist. 
 In honor of National Accordion Awareness Month, I decided to look into it further, found the website ladyofspain.com and learned: 
 n National Accordion Awareness Month was established in 1989 to help spread the word about the resurgence in popularity in the accordion and to educate people about the accordion. 
 n A blue-ribbon panel of experts recently named the accordion as the instrument most likely to put a smile on your face when hearing it played. 
 n The piano accordion is the official musical instrument of the city of San Francisco and has been since 1990. 
 n Actress Lucy Liu plays the accordion. 
 n Guitarist Nils Lofgren started on the accordion. 
 n Billy Joel and Barry Manilow also play the accordion. 
 n The accordion is a member of the reed family, not the keyboard family. 
 n Castelfidardo, a small town in the Le Marche region of Italy, produces most accordions in Italy. 
 n The accordion family also includes Cajun button boxes, chromatic and diatonic button accordions, the concertina, the bayan and the bandoneon. 
 n China is the largest manufacturer and exporter of accordions in the world. 
 My husband and I owned an accordion. My mother-in-law found one in her apartment building, so she brought it to us, knowing we would have fun with it. 
 It was red and so old the keys had begun falling off. Even though I’d had piano lessons, I couldn’t play it. Not only am I not a good musician, the thing was too heavy for me to play, carry and squeeze at the same time. 
 My husband didn’t play keyboards, but he could carry it, make ominous sounds with it and use it to mess with the dogs.

 The tank standoff, memorialized by several photographers including Jeff Widener of The Associated Press , has become a symbol of defiance around the world. 
 While public remembrances of the Tiananmen protests are strictly forbidden in mainland China, there are regular commemorations in democratically governed Taiwan.

 Tales of the City's Lauren Morelli on Bridging Generations of Fans 
 Morelli, the showrunner for Netflix's Tales of the City, speaks candidly about coming out during Orange Is the New Black and bringing Tales to new fans. 
 May 31 2019 5:39 PM EDT 
 Editor's note: This interview was conducted for The Advocate's weekly news podcast, The Ten.  Click here to listen . 
 The beloved series Tales of the City, based on Armistead Maupin’s revelational stories of the queer denizens of San Francisco’s off-the-beaten-track Barbary Lane, is coming back to television this June. Several of the lovable quirky characters that fans of the series know so well will be back, while the series introduces a host of LGBTQ people who represent a spectrum of sexual and gender identity for a new generation. 
 To handle the delicate balance of maintaining the heart of the original while drawing in a new set of fans, Lauren Morelli, 36, was brought on to shepherd the series into a new era. Best known for her work as a writer on the game-changing series Orange Is the New Black, Morelli became known in queer circles in 2014 when she penned a coming out op-ed explaining that due to her work writing storylines for queer women on that series, she realized later in life that she was gay, although she had been married to a man. 
 On this week’s episode of The Ten, Morelli speaks openly about working with a primarily queer writer’s room, what she learned from working closely with Maupin and original Tales director Alan Poul, coming out later in life, how her friendship with Wiley grew into a romance, and the challenge of how to handle Olympia Dukakis (a cis woman) coming back to play the show's trans matriarch. 
 [Read highlights below and click here for the full podcast.] 
 Tracy E. Gilchrist: The original Tales of the City was incredibly revolutionary. You were part of what I think is new queer TV with Orange Is the New Black. Now there's Transparent, Pose, The Bold Type, Vida... How did you ensure that the new Tales would have the essence of being revolutionary like the first one was? 
 Lauren Morelli: It's scary to make queer shows because as a community they're so important to us and so I feel a great responsibility to not mess that up. 
 I hired six incredible queer smart brilliant talented people to be in the writers' room with me. It felt more like, how do we talk about the stories that are happening around us. The example that comes to mind is there are two characters on the show Jake and Margot who are in a relationship and Jake is a trans guy who has recently transitioned and is negotiating his new gender identity and is also now starting to negotiate an emerging sexuality that is a surprise to him. 
 As a result of that, the two of them are in this position where then they're negotiating all of those things together. Margot identifies as a lesbian and is grieving her loss of a visible queer identity. That is a story that I saw happening in my own friend group several times over. And yet I hadn't really seen that story tackled. So I think it just became a question of how do you continue to push the envelope of the stories that are being told. 
 Regarding your work on Orange Is The New Black, it was personal for you. You were writing pieces of Piper and Alex's storyline, which I believe I read helped inform your [sexual] identity or clear it up? 
 We were sitting in a writers room all day long as a group and coming up with those stories. In retrospect, certainly, and I continue to work out my stuff on the page, right? All the time I'll finish a script and be like, Oh that's what I was doing. Like how embarrassing that I just was like working out all my mom's stuff on that on the page. 
 The stories that I was so lucky to write [on Orange] weren't necessarily stories that I had come up with in my own brain but I did get to sit with those characters on the page and have them talk to one another and the conversations that we would have in the writers room around sexuality, certainly,  I had started to take them home.  But I couldn't quite figure out what was happening. Was this the first kind of epiphany around her identity? Totally, yeah. Which is always a really important part for me to talk about because I think often we get sold a very black or white narrative around sexuality. This is actually a result of white men getting to define our stories and I feel like female sexuality can sometimes be very different from male sexuality. 
 I remember feeling crazy. I felt like I genuinely didn't know and how couldn't I have known or you were locked in a basement somewhere 
 It was like that was part of what was maddening about it to me. I couldn't find anybody with my story and I would Google all day long.  I could find eight thousand videos of cats and I couldn't find anybody saying I was married to a man. And now I've had this realization about myself and that feels like an honest realization instead of something that I was lying to about myself. 
 You've blazed a trail all the way to being showrunner for Tales of the City.  This show was so important to so many people. You'll have that to contend with—the fans the diehards.  You have Alan Poul and Armistead Maupin on board and now you have this kind of new queer representation and social media to also contend with because social media feedback can kind of inform where things go sometimes. What's it been like to create this show and cross that bridge. 
 It's terrifying for sure. I think we were really aligned on this as a creative team to hopefully satisfy a pre-existing fan and give them some more stories about these lives of people who they've already fallen in love with and for some people have spent decades reading about but then also usher in a new generation of fans who might not have been exposed to these stories in this world before. But bridging that gap is tough. The pilot episode is a really great example of this. How do you catch someone up so that they don't feel like they're missing out? It is so important to me that no one feels excluded because that's so against the ethos of Barbary Lane. Everybody's welcome. So if anyone who knows the show or doesn't know the show should also feel welcome.",1

 It’s an exciting time in southern Brazoria County as our athletes are making it known across the state that our high school sports teams are a force to be reckoned with. 
 After seeing our track and field athletes come home with medals, a Brazoswood golfer put up a good fight at the state tournament and tennis players do the same, the diamond is where players from Danbury, Angleton and Sweeny are sparkling now. 
 For all three of those programs, the chance to go to Austin to compete for a championship trophy is not unusual. All have consistent standards of excellence. 
 With a win Friday, the top-ranked Ladycats are one win away from a state Class 5A softball championship, which would be the school’s first in a quarter-century. For some of the players on this team, this is their second chance at the hardware, missing out in 2016 when they were freshmen. 
 The Danbury Lady Panthers were eliminated in the Class 3A state semifinals Wednesday by powerhouse Hallettsville, which came into the game having lost only once all season. Danbury has been a regular contender for the state championship, its grittiness pushing it to success year in and year out. 
 Sweeny is making its second consecutive trip to the state baseball championship after run-ruling Waco Robinson to win its best-of-three series Friday afternoon. The rain-interrupted game meant the seniors would have to wait a little longer to graduate Friday evening, but we doubt they minded. 
 Every week it seems we have another name on these pages of a local senior who has signed with a college program to continue their sports careers. These are students who have dedicated years of their lives to improving their skills, then setting personal goals aside in the name of team success. 
 Whether or not someone has a personal connection to any of these schools, there is something to be proud of when a local team competes with the state’s high-profile elites. The most recent medal-winners only reinforce what those of us here already knew — the sports stars in Brazoria County are as big and bright as any other in Texas.

 PRWeb 
 Published 
 3:00 pm EDT, Saturday, June 1, 2019 
 For many women, motherhood is their life’s purpose and goal, but what happens when God’s plan isn’t as simple as you thought? Read all about the emotional and spiritual triumphs and tragedies faced by author Bethanee R. Syversen in her new book, Mustard Seed Faith: A Journey through Infertility, Miscarriages, Adoption, and Faith. 
 BOSTON (PRWEB) June 01, 2019 
 In her new book, Mustard Seed Faith: A Journey through Infertility, Miscarriages, Adoption, and Faith, Bethanee R. Syversen shares her personal journey into motherhood and how she experienced the ultimate tests of faith as a wife and mother. Her book describes her experiences starting a big family with her husband, Jason, and how God works in mysterious ways so that the couple can be the parents of many God-loving children—something both of them always wanted, even before they met in church. 
 Mustard Seed Faith shares with readers the different kinds of struggles a hopeful mother faces; namely infertility, miscarriages, the pain of loss, and hope. Bethanee shares words of encouragement and offers advice to people who may be experiencing similar situations from different sides, particularly how words from concerned friends can be hurtful despite their good intentions. 
 “This was my anchor: knowing that I will find God every single time I seek Him,” says the author as she and her husband started the big family they’ve always wanted. “In all the struggles and hardships, I will find God if I daily get on my knees and seek Him. And He promises that we will find Him. God does not promise to take away our problems or give us a struggle-free life, but He promises to be found and to be present with us.” 
 In the span of a decade, Bethanee and Jason successfully have four biological children and proceed with trying adoption. The pain remains the same, though, whether it’s from a miscarriage or a prospective adoption that doesn’t push through. She also talks about how her heart breaks for the many children who continue being denied a loving family due to flaws in the system (both domestic and international), and she continues praying for expectant mothers who have their own life struggles that end in them planning an abortion or making other questionable decisions. 
 “Those years of infertility and miscarriages were some of the darkest years of my life. The loss felt unbearable at times,” she shares. “However, I’m grateful for what I learned about myself. I learned that I am a survivor. I am dedicated. I am consistent. I am driven. And I am a fighter. And I am thankful that God was with me all along the way helping me through all of the loss and, in the process, helping me learn how to handle difficult situations.” 
 After much heartbreak and endless tests of their faith, the author and her husband are blessed by God with six amazing children, supportive friends, an ever-loving family, and the chance to be a blessing to others. While scarred and drained of many tears, Bethanee’s faith in the Lord grows as strong as her children with each passing day; and through her book, she hopes that readers will allow Him to show them their own purpose and write their story to glorify His Kingdom.

 Now Playing: The History Of E3 
 Leave Blank 
 Arguably the most important gaming event of the year, E3 2019 , is just around the corner. The annual trade show returns in less than two weeks, and in the days leading up to it, a few of the industry's biggest developers and publishers will hold press conferences showcasing some of the new titles they have on the way. That includes Bethesda, which has announced it is once again hosting its own E3 press conference just a couple of days ahead of the expo. 
 This year, Bethesda's press conference takes place on Sunday, June 9, a few hours after Microsoft's E3 Xbox One briefing. The presentation is set to kick off at 5:30 PM PT / 8:30 PM ET (1:30 AM BST on June 10) and will be broadcast online for viewers at home via Bethesda's Twitch channel and other places. 
 As for what we can expect from the conference, Bethesda has been very tight-lipped. During last year's briefing, the publisher unveiled a number of huge titles, including Rage 2 , Doom Eternal , The Elder Scrolls VI , and a brand-new property, Starfield . So far the publisher has only confirmed that Doom Eternal will have a presence at this year's conference, but it certainly won't be the only game the company shows off. We know DLC for Rage 2 is on the way, so we may get our first glimpse at that during this year's briefing. 
 However, two titles we can safely rule out are Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI. Last month, Bethesda's Todd Howard confirmed that neither title will be at this year's show . According to the company, last year's reveals were just a ""sneak peak"" at the technology it's been working on, and that both Starfield and ES6 are still a ways off, so we'll likely need to wait a little longer to get more details about those games. 
 Be sure to check out GameSpot's full coverage of E3 2019 for the latest breaking news. You can also see what all the other publishers have lined up for this year's show in the full E3 conference schedule .

 California Dems in crisis as presidential hopefuls descend 
 ATLANTA (AP) — New York voters for years have experienced some of the longest wait times in the nation on Election Day. Attempts to fix the problem routinely became casualties of the divided politics of the state Legislature. 
 That dynamic changed last November, when Democrats won majorities in both legislative chambers, and it didn't take them long to act. 
 Just weeks into this year's legislative session, they passed a bill to allow early voting, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo promptly signed it. 
 ""Early voting is going to make a significant difference for countless numbers of New Yorkers by making polling places so much more accessible and allow voters to determine when it is most convenient for them,"" said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York. 
 New York is among a small number of states where Democrats made big gains in last year's election and have used that power to pass laws to make it easier to register and to vote. They have introduced early voting, all-mail voting or automatic registration. 
 A few Republican-led states — some of which saw high turnout for Democratic candidates — are going in the opposite direction, advancing bills to tighten voter registration and early voting. 
 ""Some of this seems like a fairly direct response to things that happened in the midterms,"" said Max Feldman, who tracks voting laws at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law. 
 In New Mexico, Democrats not only expanded their majority in the state House but also claimed the governor's mansion after eight years of GOP control. By March, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had signed a law to allow people to register and vote on the same day beginning in 2021. Previously, registration ended 28 days before an election. 
 Hawaii lawmakers approved legislation replacing the in-person voting system with one made up entirely of mailed ballots. If the measure is signed into law, the state will join Colorado, Oregon and Washington with mail-only voting. Delaware approved in-person, early voting beginning in 2022. 
 While bills increasing voter access this year far outnumbered those seeking to impose restrictions, many of the expansion bills were put forward by Democratic lawmakers in states led by Republicans. That means they are unlikely pass. 
 In the 2018 elections, Democrats nearly doubled to 14 the number of states in which they control the governor's office and both legislative chambers, but Republicans remain in charge in more states — 22. 
 While some voting reforms such as automatic registration have drawn bipartisan support, Republicans generally have opposed same-day registration, mail-only voting and other changes, saying they increase the potential for fraud. 
 In Connecticut, Republicans recently thwarted a push by Democrats to do as New York did and add in-person, early voting. Democrats have a legislative majority there, but a constitutional amendment is required to make the change, and they fell short of garnering the votes necessary to put the issue on the ballot. 
 Republicans had expressed concern that early voters might come to regret their selections if a race's dynamics shifted after they had turned in their ballot. 
 GOP lawmakers in some states also have targeted groups that register voters. They say such groups can create a burden for local election officials if they turn in large numbers of forms that are incomplete or contain false information. 
 In Tennessee, Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed a law that allows for fines against groups turning in 100 or more incomplete registration forms in a year. 
 ""This bill was presented because of actual circumstances that were meant to confuse the integrity, or to create a lack of integrity, in the voting process,"" Lee said. 
 Critics say Tennessee's Republicans feel threatened by an increase in voter participation last year. In 2018, turnout in the state was 51 percent higher than in the previous midterm election. About 259,500 new voters registered in the six months before Election Day. 
 ""What politicians should be doing is making sure that local election officials have the adequate resources to do their jobs,"" ACLU attorney Sophia Lakin said in announcing a federal lawsuit challenging the new law. ""Silencing civic groups' voices is not the solution."" 
 In Texas, where Democrats picked up two congressional seats last year, lawmakers have been considering a bill that would make it a felony rather than a misdemeanor to knowingly put false information on a voter registration form. It would also increase scrutiny of those who provide transportation for voters headed to the polls. 
 The legislation passed the state Senate but stalled in the House. 
 Voter-suppression claims also have been made against Republicans in Florida, over a constitutional amendment voters approved last year that would make it easier for convicted felons to regain the right to vote. 
 Republican lawmakers, in drafting legislation to implement the amendment, said its language about felons having to complete ""all terms of their sentence including parole or probation"" also meant paying all court fees, fines and restitution before being eligible to vote. 
 ""This measure is nothing but a poll tax that would effectively disenfranchise those who are unable to pay,"" Rep. Marcia L. Fudge, an Ohio Democrat, said during a recent congressional hearing in Florida. 
 The bill's sponsor, GOP state Sen. Jeff Brandes, defended it, saying: ""Our goal was to follow the constitution, and the constitution is clear — 'all terms of the sentence.'""

70526,"Siakam comes from small settings to star on NBA's big stage 
 By                                                                                    BRIAN MAHONEY Associated Press 
 May 31, 2019 — 4:35pm 
 TORONTO — The path to the best NBA Finals debut in seven years began in Cameroon and has stretched from New Mexico to the suburbs of Toronto. 
 Pascal Siakam had to emerge from some small settings before he could reach the big time. 
 That made Siakam's 32-point performance in Game 1 even more impressive. The players who often stand out this time of year are the can't-miss prospects who seemed destined for greatness from the time they were kids. 
 Siakam hadn't even started playing basketball by then. 
 But there he was Thursday night, shooting 14 of 17 from the field to spark Toronto's 118-109 victory over Golden State. 
 ""I've never seen anything like that before,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""That's a pretty big stage for a guy to put that kind of performance on, almost with any background."" 
 It was the most points in an NBA Finals debut since Kevin Durant had 36 for Oklahoma City in 2012, and it made Siakam the first player to score 30 or more on at least 80 percent shooting in a finals game since Shaquille O'Neal did it in 2004. 
 Those players were top-two picks, as were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon and Tim Duncan, the other players since 1970 with 30 points in an NBA Finals Game 1 within their first three pro seasons. 
 Siakam was way down at No. 27 in the 2016 draft. Golden State's Draymond Green — a second-round pick — said there's a different level of admiration for players who have played themselves into starring roles from what are considered supporting spots. 
 ""You come into this league and there's really no space for you,"" Green said. ""You're essentially someone who kind of comes in — I mean, you can be out in a year, you can be out in two years, you can be out in four years. And to gain that respect and to, as I said before, become one of those guys, I think it's special. Siakam has done that."" 
 The 6-foot-9 Siakam was already a good athlete, having played soccer as a boy in Cameroon. But it was his desire to become a good basketball player that's kept him in the gym long hours to make up for his late start in the game. 
 He took part in a Basketball without Borders camp in South Africa in 2012 at 18 and was soon on the way to the U.S. to embark on a basketball career. He ended up at New Mexico State for two seasons, winning Western Athletic Conference player of the year in his second one, before the Raptors drafted him. 
 Siakam was MVP of the 2017 NBA G League Finals after helping Raptors 905 win the title, but success with the big club would have to wait. He didn't have a reliable shot yet, certainly not reliable enough to be a regular contributor on a 50-win team. But he's developed one over the summers and unleashed it on opponents during this season, when he averaged 16.9 points and played well enough to be a finalist for Most Improved Player. 
 ""He works, works, works,"" Nurse said. ""He takes care of himself. He's really got a burning desire to be a very, very good player in this league."" 
 But the biggest change for Siakam came off the court. 
 He was in college when his father, Tchamo, died. Siakam, who still writes ""RIP Dad"" on his sneakers, called it the hardest moment of his life but said it was a turning point into making him into the person he has become. 
 ""Thank God I had the support of my teammates and coaches in college that helped me go through it. But it was definitely one of the toughest moments in my life, and not being able to go home for the funeral and all that,"" Siakam said. 
 ""So it was definitely a moment where it kind of tested me as a man. Just being able to go through that and for me using that as a motivation and something that's going to push me to do better things for my family and for myself, for my dad."" 
 Green, a former Defensive Player of the Year, blamed himself for the poor defense on Siakam and vowed to be better Sunday in Game 2. Siakam knows there will be adjustments, but he might make some, too. 
 ""I think I always say, I learned a lot and I know I have a lot to learn,"" Siakam said. ""I think that's one of the advantages for me. I know I have so much to learn. I have to grow. It allows me to look at my mistakes and evaluate them and try to see how I can do better.""

 Trump hitting Mexico with 5% tariff in response to migrants 
 WASHINGTON (AP) — In a surprise announcement that could compromise a major trade deal, President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he is slapping a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports to pressure the country to do more to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross the border. 
 He said the percentage will gradually increase “until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied.” 
 Trump made the announcement by tweet after telling reporters earlier Thursday that he was planning “a major statement” that would be his “biggest” so far on the border. 
 “On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied,” he wrote, “at which time the Tariffs will be removed.” 
 Trump has accused the Mexican government of failing to do enough to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants who have been flowing to the U.S in search of asylum from countries including El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. 
 The announcement comes as the administration has been pushing for passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that would update the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 The White House said Trump would be using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement the tariff. 
 “If the illegal migration crisis is alleviated through effective actions taken by Mexico, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment, the Tariffs will be removed,” the White House said in a statement. 
 But if Trump is not satisfied, the 5% figure will increase to 10% on July 1, to 15% on Aug. 1, to 20% on Sept. 1 and to 25% on Oct. 1. 
 “Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory,” the statement read. 
 During a visit to Canada on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence vowed the deal would be passed this year. 
 “Our administration is working earnestly with leaders in the Congress of the United States to approve the USMCA this summer,” he said. Asked by reporters about the new tariff consideration, Pence said that both Mexico and Congress need to do more and that Trump is determined to use his authority to call on them to do so. 
 Trump had said Thursday morning that he was planning “a major statement on the border” later Thursday or Friday that would be his “biggest statement, so far, on the border.” 
 “This is a big-league statement. But we are going to do something very dramatic on the border, because people are coming into our country — the Democrats will not give us laws,” he said as he headed to a commencement speech for 2019 United States Air Force Academy graduates.

 Below is a report that DML News gives a 4 OUT OF 4 STARS trustworthiness rating.  
 As the most reliable and balanced news aggregation service on the internet, DML News App offers the following information published by THEDAILYBEAST.COM: 
 Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA), who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination with a primary focus on  climate change , is pledging to raise the ceiling for annual refugee admissions in the United States. 
 As part of his  “America’s Promise”  immigration plan unveiled on Friday morning, Inslee is proposing that his administration would meet and eventually exceed a target of 110,000 refugee resettlements set during the final year of President Obama’s administration. Last year, the Trump administration  announced a plan  for the following year to cap the number at a historic low of 30,000. 
 The article goes on to state the following: 
 He also intends to end the Trump administration’s  “Remain in Mexico” policy, which has made asylum seekers from Central America await adjudication of their cases in Mexico as opposed to the United States. Additionally, Inslee proposes “a regional refugee resettlement initiative” that would combine efforts of national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international partners to manage needs of applicants from the Northern Triangle region of Central America. 
 The Daily Beast noted that Inslee’s plan includes “expedited eligibility for a path to citizenship for DREAMers” and “extending federal financial aid programs to DREAMers.”  In addition: 
 Inslee also proposes immediate action in the first 100 days of his administration by ending Trump’s planned wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, rescinding the Muslim travel ban, ending the use of solitary confinement as a general practice within Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities, and setting a mandate to reduce the population of immigrants in detention. 
 It’s clear: America’s immigration system is fundamentally broken. We need immigration policy that’s humane, efficient, and just. Today, I’m announcing my immigration plan, America’s Promise. https://t.co/2F1X1qW9QD",1

 Back to Gallery 
 Next summer, the Raiders are slated to relocate to Las Vegas and begin playing in a sleek $1.8 billion dome with a transparent roof, a black glass exterior to match their boldest uniform color, and retractable doors to frame an 80-foot-tall and 215-foot wide view of the casinos on the strip. 
 Around the same time, the Rams and Chargers will settle in a Los Angeles suburb in a futuristic, covered-yet-light-filled stadium straight out of ""The Jetsons"" cartoon. It will be the centerpiece of a 298-acre entertainment and lifestyle complex originally projected to cost $2.6 billion that could come close to doubling in price. 
 Two years ago, the Falcons moved into Mercedes-Benz Stadium, a $1.6 billion facility in Atlanta with a pinwheel-like cover that opens and closes like a camera lens. The season before that, the Minnesota Vikings arrived at U.S. Bank Stadium, a $1.1 billion venue with the league's first translucent roof , five pivoting glass front doors facing the Minneapolis skyline, and a ship-like shape reflecting the region's Nordic heritage after extensive cultural research by the designing architectural firm HKS. 
 In 2010, the New York Giants and New York Jets kicked off at $1.6 billion MetLife Stadium in New Jersey with an official NFL-high seating capacity of 82,500. In the previous year, the Dallas Cowboys unveiled their new $1.1 billion suburban home with a high-definition, four-sided, center-hung videoboard that's 160 feet long, equal to four city buses, and 71 feet high. 
 These venues being added to the league over the last decade sure have taken quite the leap from Lambeau Field. 
 Of course, even that hallowed home of the Green Bay Packers that opened in 1957 has undergone two significant renovations since the turn of the century. The NFL's smallest city has modernized and monetized the stadium and surrounding development. 
 Of the current 32 teams, seven remain in facilities erected prior to 1995 — sort of. One, the Chicago Bears, moved out in 2002 so Soldier Field could be completely rebuilt on the same site. Only the exterior colonnades endured the $690 million renovation. The Miami Dolphins had Hard Rock Stadium (1987) remade for $500 million. 
 Attending a game has become as much about experiencing the immediate area and enjoying the amenities as simply watching four quarters of football. 
 ""They have a personality. They have a powerful formal expression. They do things to create an iconic, globally recognizable facility,"" said Bryan Trubey, a principal architect at HKS, the lead designer on the Rams-Chargers, Vikings, and Cowboys projects. ""For a billion dollars, you should get something that the rest of the world looks at and recognizes instantly, whether there is a name on it or not."" 
 The league has embarked on its 100th season, triggering a natural reflection on the transformation of the game from humble, helmetless beginnings to a business with more than $14 billion in annual revenue that draws more 100 million people to watch the Super Bowl on television. Perhaps no aspect has evolved more drastically than the places where these games are played. 
 ""Without the people present to make the stadium a reality, they never would have happened, but stadiums can and should be celebrated for the moments in history that occurred within their confines,"" said Eric Grubman, a former NFL executive who worked heavily on the development of new venues. ""The great game, the great sadness, the great celebration, whatever it may be."" 
 According to Pro Football Reference's online database , 166 stadiums have hosted at least one regular season game since the NFL began. That includes rival leagues — the All-American Football Conference (1946-49) and the American Football League (1960-69) — that were eventually absorbed. One hundred of those venues have hosted 17 games or more. 
 Over the first half of the league's life span, teams were frequently shoehorned into baseball parks where baseball clubs took top billing. The Bears played at Wrigley Field for 50 seasons. The Giants had long-time homes at the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium. The Cardinals, now in Arizona after moving from St. Louis, were tenants at Comiskey Park and Wrigley Field where the franchise originated in Chicago. 
 Then there were the pre-war public works projects like Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where the Rams returned in 2016 from St. Louis after first playing there from 1946-1979. Cleveland Municipal Stadium housed the Browns for a half-century before their move to Baltimore that embittered the lakeside city. 
 On through the AstroTurf era of the 1960s and 1970s, when several teams moved with their baseball counterparts into cookie-cutter circles with few frills, stadiums were still primarily taxpayer funded. By the time the mid-1990s came, though, multi-purpose was out. Fancy was in. 
 Owners began pumping in their own money in search of new revenue streams from premium seating areas and chef-driven concessions, aided in part by an NFL loan program known as ""G-4"" funding . As the price tags for construction surged, so did the public costs, even if the percentage share was much lower than in the past. Many of these modern projects came with predictable controversy. Anti-stadium forces often were passionate enough to be driven by both conservatives and liberals decrying the sizes and purposes of the subsidies. Proponents, meanwhile, touted municipal benefits such as sales tax revenue, job creation and civic pride. 
 According to an Associated Press calculation of at-the-time, publicly reported construction costs, not factoring for inflation, the NFL's current 31 stadiums cost a collective $17.7 billion to build. The average public share was roughly 55%, with 45% from private capital. MetLife Stadium and the soon-to-open complex in Los Angeles did not seek direct taxpayer contributions. 
 ""When you find the examples of the ones that really do help the city, behind it is almost always an owner who actually knows what he's doing,"" said Roger Noll, a Stanford professor of economics, in a 2017 interview. ""That is to say he's someone who cares about the city, and he really wants it to be improved. So he doesn't just max out for himself. He tries to build something that's going to be more integrated, where the facility is more integrated into the businesses around it as opposed to competing with them."" 
 That's the name of the stadium game these days: the live experience. With the ease of watching games in ultra-HD from the comfort of the couch, NFL teams have faced more of a challenge than ever to keep fans coming through the doors. What they'll always be able to offer, of course, is the communal satisfaction that comes from seeing the winning touchdown in real time while the roar of 60,000 fans fills the building. 
 Grubman, now chairman of the board for the hospitality company On Location Experiences, recalled taking his then-teenage sons to Lambeau Field for the NFC championship game after the 2007 season between the Giants and the Packers. The wind chill factor at kickoff was 23 degrees below zero. No longer interested in the box seats or luxury spaces their father had access to, the boys persuaded dad to sit in the seats. 
 ""I froze, and I loved it, because I'm an old fan myself,"" Grubman said. 
 After the game, they asked to walk on the field. 
 ""I said, 'Yeah, I can take you. Why do you want to do that?' They said, 'We want to touch it,'"" Grubman said. ""To them, they were touching history.""  ",1

 TAIPEI, Taiwan 
 An artist has erected an inflatable display in Taiwan's capital to mark an iconic moment in the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. 
 The larger-than-life balloon installation, which stands in front of Taipei's famous Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, portrays a peaceful encounter between a Chinese civilian and the military tanks that contributed to a brutal shutdown of the demonstrations in Beijing on June 4, 1989. The tank standoff, memorialized by several photographers including Jeff Widener of The Associated Press , has become a symbol of defiance around the world. 
 Hundreds of people walked by the installation Saturday morning. Many took selfies and photos of the artwork, which has been up for a few weeks. 
 While public remembrances of the Tiananmen protests are strictly forbidden in mainland China, there are regular commemorations in democratically governed Taiwan and Hong Kong, China's semi-autonomous southern region. Next Tuesday marks 30 years since the protests, led by students who were joined by individuals from all walks of life, calling for political reform.

46267,"White Sox down Indians for 5th straight win 
 e-mail 
 Charlie Tilson ripped a go-ahead, two-run double in the third inning, and the Chicago White Sox pulled away for a 6-1 win over the visiting Cleveland Indians on Friday night. 
 Jose Abreu and Yolmer Sanchez also drove in one run apiece for the White Sox, who increased their season-high winning streak to five games. Chicago scored six-plus runs for the third straight game. 
 Francisco Lindor hit a solo shot to lead off the game for the Indians' lone run. Cleveland has dropped two in a row, five of seven and nine of 12. 
 White Sox right-hander Dylan Covey (1-4) allowed one run on eight hits in six innings. He walked one and struck out five while earning his first victory since Aug. 31, 2018. 
 Indians right-hander Trevor Bauer (4-5) gave up six runs (two earned) on nine hits in seven innings. He walked one and struck out eight and was not helped by a shaky Cleveland defense that committed four errors. 
 Cleveland jumped to a 1-0 lead when Lindor blasted the third pitch of the game into the right field bleachers. The shot marked his 15th career homer to lead off a game, including his third of the season. 
 The White Sox took control from there. 
 Chicago went ahead 2-1 in the third when Tilson doubled to score Yoan Moncada and Yonder Alonso. 
 One inning later, the White Sox added three more runs. Abreu hit a sacrifice fly to deep center field to score Sanchez. An error by Indians first baseman Carlos Santana on a ball hit by Alonso allowed Seby Zavala and Leury Garcia to come home. 
 Bauer unleashed a string of expletives after Santana's error, but his frustrations were far from over. 
 Tim Anderson reached on a throwing error by Indians third baseman Mike Freeman with one out in the fifth. Anderson stole second base and scored on a single by Sanchez to increase Chicago's lead to 6-1. 
 Zavala notched his first big league hit in the fourth inning. The White Sox promoted the San Diego State product a week ago to fill in for Welington Castillo, who went on the seven-day concussion list.

 Police: Former Dover Councilman Hit Pride Parade Organizer With Truck 
 Posted: 
 tlehman@wboc.com 
 Reuben Salters (Dover Police Department). 
 DOVER, Del. --- A former Dover councilman on Saturday morning was charged with vehicular assault after striking an organizer of an LGBTQ event with his truck, city police said. 
 Reuben Salters, 90, has been charged with third-degree vehicular assault and Failure to Obey a Traffic Device but was also released on his own recognizance, according to Cpl. Mark Hoffman, a Dover police spokesman. 
 Salters was driving in the area of Forrest and West streets about 8:15 a.m. when he circumvented a barrel barricade blocking the street for the The Delaware Pride Festival parade, Hoffman said. 
 Police say Salters then got out of his truck and drove to a street with a large crowd of parade goers and participants that had been blocked off by cones, got out of his truck, and began to move the cones. 
 A 43-year-old organizer of the event confronted Salters and told him the cones were blocking the street for the event and he could not pass through, Hoffman said. 
 Salters then got back in his truck and accelerated into the organizer, knocking him to the ground and causing leg injuries, Hoffman said. 
 Police said Salters then proceeded to drive through the crowd before coming to a stop. 
 Salters served on Dover city council for more than two decades and founded the Inner City Cultural League. A Linkedin page listed him as the president of the group. 
 Hoffman said there was no evidence to suggest the incident was a hate crime and may have involved road rage. 
 The man who was hit by the car was not hospitalized, Hoffman said. 
 Last year, a man was charged with a hate crime after an assault police said occurred at the Delaware Pride Festival.",1

 A special court on Friday sent three doctors arrested for allegedly abetting Dr Payal Tadvi's suicide to judicial custody till June 10. This came as a huge relief for their families who were present for the proceedings. Bhakti Mehare, Hema Ahuja and Ankita Khandelwal were produced before the additional sessions judge R M Sadrani, who rejected the argument of the special public prosecutor Raja Thakare and the Mumbai Crime Branch that had sought a seven-day extension of the accused's police custody. 
 No substantial evidence 
 After hearing both sides, Sadrani observed, ""Nothing from the case diary and post-mortem report has revealed this to be a murder. No substantial evidence has been collected to grant further police custody."" ""There has been no recovery of the suicide note for which police custody was sought. Today, the custody has been sought mainly on the grounds that it is necessary for the confrontation of the accused with the other witnesses. In my opinion, police custody cannot be granted for this purpose alone. The grounds raised by the prosecution to seek police custody are insufficient,"" Sadrani said.",1

 Australia’s ambassador to Indonesia returned to Jakarta on Tuesday, more than a month after he was recalled over the execution of the Bali Nine duo, according to local media reports. Australian citizens Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were executed  by Indonesia on April 29 for drug trafficking, a deeply contentious move that provoked diplomatic condemnation from Australia. 
 In response, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott withdrew Ambassador Paul Grigson over what he called a “cruel and unnecessary” punishment. High-level ministerial visits to the Southeast Asian nation were also suspended. 
 Grigson’s recall was the first instance of Canberra withdrawing its ambassador to Indonesia. In recent weeks, he has been in talks with Australian officials over how to restore relations between the two countries, according to the Australian. 
 A spokeswoman for Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop confirmed that Grigson had returned to Indonesia on Tuesday, the Sydney Morning Herald reported . 
 Also on Tuesday, Indonesia snubbed Australia by announcing that it would send an ambassador instead of a ministerial representative for a high-level regional security summit to be held later in the week in Sydney. 
 Foreign policy analysts recommended that Australia look into setting up a counterterrorism center in Jakarta to coordinate its response to regional threats, the Australian reported. 
 The events come shortly after Australian Defense Minister Kevin Andrews did not hold a bilateral meeting with his Indonesian counterpart at the Shangri-La dialogue at the end of May in Singapore. 
 In 2013, Indonesia recalled its ambassador to Australia in protest over revelations that Australian spies had attempted to tap the communications of former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his wife. He returned after six months.

 Friday, May 31st 2019, 5:46 PM EDT 
 Originally posted on https://mtpurchasing.com/corporate-travel-and-lodging-solutions-through-group-purchasing/ 
 In 2019, expert analysts say that business travel costs are going to rise. 
 That’s right, with hotel prices set to rise nearly 4% in under a year and flights increasing by 2.6%, you’re going to want to find ways to combat the bump. 
 However, reducing your travel budget doesn’t always mean you have to slash employee per diems or opt for lodging in the middle of nowhere. 
 Corporate travel is easier and more cost-effective when you finance it through group purchasing. New to group purchasing? Here’s everything you need to know. 
 What to Know About Group Purchasing 
  
 A group purchasing organization leverages its buying power by negotiating deals with larger companies who are offering rates at a wholesale price. 
 This might mean you can receive reduced, wholesale prices on things such as office supplies, shipping, and even hotels. 
 As a small business , this is especially helpful, as you wouldn’t be able to receive the same prices if you didn’t go through a group purchasing organization. 
 Why not just link up with a corporate lodging company yourself? These companies usually have minimum spending requirements to qualify for discounts. Most small to mid-sized companies don’t meet these requirements alone. 
 This is why group purchasing organizations have members, which are companies of various sizes all around the country or world. It’s as if a bunch of small businesses got together to purchase office supplies or book hotels in bulk. 
 Instead, the group purchasing organization is negotiating these deals and purchasing on their behalf. 
 This cuts out a lot of wasted time spent looking for deals, making calls, negotiating, and even handling the booking end of corporate travel. 
 Understanding the Difficulties of Corporate Travel 
 When employees travel, it costs a business money. That’s a no-brainer. But, did you know that businesses lose money simply because they don’t understand the rate index of the average nightly cost of a hotel? 
 This is because this information is usually hard to find. And, if you find it, it’s hard to compare against other cities. 
 Room rates and hidden costs are one of the most difficult things to assess for smaller companies who are simply trying to stay afloat. 
 Another major challenge is figuring out indirect costs. 
 Is parking free at the hotel? Is the WiFi included? These are questions that most people don’t think to look out for but can add a lot to the bottom line of corporate travel expenses. 
 When a company isn’t prepared to search for these types of issues beforehand, they find themselves receiving the brunt of the blow when it comes time to pay. Group purchasing organizations take the guesswork out of bookings and billing by doing it all for you. 
 They have pre-negotiated rates and relationships with hotels. They’ve done all of the research into hidden fees and know exactly what amenities come with the price. 
 Even better, these organizations save you money by allowing your employees to focus on other things. 
 Employees spend at least 20 minutes reading hotel reviews before booking a room. Multiply that by a few employees and you’ve already wasted hours of precious working time. 
 When you decide to harness the power of a group purchasing organization, you’re giving time back to your employees and saving money while doing so. That’s a win-win for everybody. 
 Instead, the group purchasing organization is negotiating these deals and purchasing on their behalf. 
 This cuts out a lot of wasted time spent looking for deals, making calls, negotiating, and even handling the booking end of corporate travel. 
 Corporate Travel Management Made Easy 
 If you’re a small business trying to handle corporate travel management, then you’ll know how difficult it is to do it alone. 
 You have to factor in things like: 
 Getting the best price 
 Finding the time to compare rates and locations 
 Accurately managing the expenses and budget you have 
 Waiting for emails and calls back from hotels 
 Sudden price changes or cancellations 
 How do you solve these travel management woes? You work with a group purchasing organization ! 
 Most have partnered with third-party companies that offer them reduced rates and serious discounts on other travel-related expenses. 
 For example, MT Purchasing’s hotel partner allows us to offer you over 20% off the regular rate of hotels. We can also help you consolidate and streamline all of your corporate travel processes. 
 This means that you’ll receive one direct bill for anything that’s booked. And, you’ll receive access to superior expense management tools. 
 This means that you’re not only saving money directly on the bookings or rentals, but you’re also saving money by optimizing your expense management processes across the board. 
  
 What to Look for in a Good GPO 
 Ready to start reducing your corporate travel expenses ? Great! Now you’ll need to figure out what you need to look for in a good group purchasing organization. 
 Most GPOs make their money by charging members a fee. That seems pretty counter-intuitive because these companies are looking for ways to cut their costs not increase them. 
 Therefore, the first thing you’ll want to look for is an organization that doesn’t charge any membership fees. Other things to look out for include: 
 No Volume Requirements: You shouldn’t have to commit to any minimum spending amount or meet any sort of volume requirement. If a GPO wants you to meet a minimum amount of bookings or money spent, look elsewhere! 
 Vendor Relationships: A great GPO will have great relationships with vendors. They should have extensive experience negotiating travel deals with various providers all across the country. These strong relationships will show in their customer service. 
 Secure Contracted Pricing: Working with a GPO means you know you’re going to receive secure pricing. This pays off when you know you’re going to have a lot of employees traveling a good portion of the time. 
 These are just a few of the things you’ll want to look for. If you’re still not sure what you need or how to unlock thousands a year in corporate travel savings, then contact us . 
 We have helped numerous businesses save on travel expenses, including hotel bookings, car rentals, and even employee travel benefits.",1

 The Missouri Department of Conservation is proposing changing the cost of trout permits, landowner permits and nonresident permits. 
 Joe Jerek, news services coordinator, said the agency is proposing increases to the prices of its annual trout permits and daily trout tags starting in 2020. 
 He said the increases are needed to better cover its costs of running five trout hatcheries that raise and release more than 1.7 million trout each year for public fishing. 
 Under the proposed fee increase, the cost of an annual trout permit will go from $7 to $10 for anglers 16 years of age and older and from $3.50 to $5 for anglers ages 15 and younger. 
 The cost of a daily trout tag to fish at Missouri’s four trout parks -- Maramec Spring Park, Bennett Spring State Park, Montauk State Park and Roaring River State Park -- will go from $3 to $4 for adults and from $2 to $3 for those 15 years of age and younger. 
 Jerek said the annual cost of fish food and staff labor to raise a trout in 2003 was about $1 per fish. The annual cost in 2017 had jumped to nearly twice that amount. 
 He said the conservation department is proposing three changes to its free permits for landowners. 
 The agency is proposing changing the minimum acreage for free landowner permits from 5 acres to 20 acres. This change will impact no-cost landowner deer and turkey hunting permits as well as permit requirements for small-game hunting, fishing and trapping on qualifying properties. 
 The department is proposing adding an online landowner registry that would provide secure records of landowners and members of their households who qualify for the free permits. 
 The electronic registry would also provide proof of land ownership and boundaries of the properties for which the free permits apply. Individuals would be required to provide their information online through a secure MDC webpage or in paper form. 
 In addition, the agency is proposing price increases for some nonresident hunting and fishing permits. 
 Jerek said permit prices have not been raised in over a decade and adjustments are needed to help keep up with increasing costs of providing conservation work and services around the state. 
 The agency is also proposing offering discounted deer and turkey permits for nonresident landowners with 75 acres or more to show appreciation for wildlife habitat work completed on their Missouri properties. 
 The discount for nonresident landowners is similar to a past regulation that was in effect until 2009. The agency eliminated the offering during its last round of permit changes in 2008. 
 The permit fee proposal includes increasing the nonresident daily fishing permit from $7 to $8, increasing the nonresident spring turkey hunting permit from $190 to $224 and increasing the nonresident firearm deer hunting permit from $225 to $265. 
 As part of the rulemaking process, the conservation department is asking for public comments on the potential changes during July and early August online at short.mdc.mo.gov/Z49 . 
 The Missouri Conservation Commission will consider input received and make a final decision during its Aug. 23 meeting. If approved, the anticipated effective date of the changes would be Feb. 29, 2020.",1

 Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
 2009—Implementing his threat to select a justice who will make decisions based on empathy, President Obama nominates Second Circuit judge Sonia Sotomayor to fill the seat of retiring justice David Souter. During the confirmation process, the “wise Latina” (at least in her own self-conception) will demoralize and disgust her supporters on the Left, as she implausibly masquerades as a caricature of a judicial conservative and even emphatically repudiates Obama’s empathy standard.

 gallbladder Member 
 NFHS. During dead ball, Coach A makes a request for Official's Inspection of B1. B1's gear is all fine, but he has large black bat wings under each eye. Coach A says the ""face paint"" is why he called for the inspection, and he wants B1 to serve penalty time. (Actual occurrence.) 
 Ruling?

 Options: 
 Treat it like a no endcap violation - go wipe it off before coming back in the game. 
 Treat it as a technical foul like a mouthpiece violation, especially if Team B was getting the ball on the restart. Give the ball to Team A - all good. 
 If Team A was getting the ball - give B1 30 seconds to sit and ponder his makeup sins and take off the face paint.

 Only Option: No Foul; fix-it ticket 
  
 LaxRef Moderator 
 Always good to check the rule book. Number is from 2018 and might have changed, but rule should be the same: 
 1.10.1 SITUATION E: A1 has eye shade (grease or non-glare strips or stickers) that is (a) a solid stroke; (b) includes words, numbers, logos or other symbols; or (c) extends outside the eye socket or below the cheek bone. RULING: (a) legal; (b) and (c) illegal. In (b) and (c), A1 must adjust the eye shade before returning to play.​ 
 I think if you have already warned Team B and continue to see it, it could definitely be a foul—I wouldn't give a separate fix-it ticket for every player on the team! 
  
 Any foul would have to be Conduct or USC for not following directive of official. 
 There is no penalty associated with 1-10-1-h (it's still the same Situation cite: 1.10.1.E). 
 So, sticking with the OP: No foul; fix-it ticket ;-) 
  
 LaxRef Moderator 
 You could also argue delay of game: ""Hey, I told you to fix it, you didn't, now I need to send you off again to get it taken care of and that has delayed the game."" But most likely CF or USC. There is no substantive difference between calling it DOG or CF here, I guess.

 I recommend removing ENTIRELY from rules. Who cares?! It's stupid but kids are stupid (as was I; in a different era) so let them be and have fun. Face paint is the least of my concern while officiating a contact sport.

 OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - The venue and the hype were different, but the result was the same. 
 Giselle ""G'' Juarez struck out 11 and gave up one run in six innings to help Oklahoma beat Oklahoma State 6-1 in the Women's College World Series on Friday. 
 The top-seeded Sooners beat the Cowgirls for the 24th consecutive time overall and the fourth time this season. It was the first time the in-state rivals played in the World Series, and the matchup helped draw a single-session record crowd of 9,820. 
 ""Knowing this was part of history - who knows if it will happen again,"" Oklahoma coach Patty Gasso said. ""Hopefully it will. But the fact that the fans came out and were enjoying it, rooting for their team, is what makes it special."" 
 Oklahoma State coach Kenny Gajewski said his team has matured to the point where the pressure wasn't overwhelming. The Cowgirls just ran into an excellent team. 
 ""I don't think anybody expected us to be here, to be very honest,"" he said. ""I felt like we were playing with house money."" 
 Oklahoma (56-3), which is seeking its third national title in four years, advanced to the semifinals on Sunday and needs one win to reach the championship series. 
 Oklahoma had eight hits, all from different players, and all six runs were scored by different players. 
 The game included a delay of about 20 minutes after the lights behind right field went out in the fifth inning. Fans had fun with it, with many turning on the flashlights on their cellphones while several songs with references to light blared through the sound system. 
 ""We were just trying to be ourselves, like our swag-tastic selves, get our fans to get rowdy,"" Oklahoma State's Rylee Bayless said. ""They were getting their place rowdy over there. We were just trying to keep the momentum high, our energy high in that moment."" 
 Samantha Show pitched four innings and gave up three runs on six hits for Oklahoma State (45-16). She went the distance in a win over Florida on Thursday. 
 Oklahoma got the scoring started right away as Jocelyn Alo singled and knocked in two in the first. Shay Knighten had an RBI single to make it 3-0 before Oklahoma State had a chance to hit. 
 ""It was just an unlucky inning for us,"" Show said. ""I felt like I was making some good pitches. They were putting balls where we weren't. I was happy that we only held them to three."" 
 Oklahoma State cut its deficit to 3-1 on an RBI single by Michaela Richbourg in the first, but Oklahoma scored three times on walks with the bases loaded in the sixth to build a comfortable lead. 
 Oklahoma State will play the winner between Washington and Minnesota in an elimination game Saturday. 
 ""We're good, and there's a reason why we're here,"" Show said. ""This game, it happened, it's done. We can't think about it again. We just have to focus on the game ahead of us because that's the most important one.""

After spending two weeks in the hospital receiving chemotherapy, Leighton Accardo decided to shave her head following a boys' baseball game. 
 Leighton wasn't alone, and had two of her friends and fellow teammates, Emily and Katie, by her side to have their heads shaved as well. 
 ""I'm not scared. My friends are here with me right now,"" Leighton told AZ Family .

8605,"Should MLB extend safety netting in all stadiums again? 
 Posted May 31, 2019 
 By The Tylt 
 by Daniel Tran 
 An MLB foul ball struck a young fan at a Houston Astros game, reigniting talk of extending stadium safety netting even farther. All 30 MLB teams already extended their safety netting last season, but expanding the net more would ensure safety and comfort in most seats. Critics think the net will obstruct views, cheapening the game experience. What do you think? 
 Chicago Cubs outfielder Albert Almora Jr. laced a foul ball into the third-base stands that struck a young girl during a game against the Houston Astros. Almora was emotional during the half-inning and after the game, hoping to seek out the family to make sure the young fan is okay. 
 Expanded protective netting would have prevented this—and other incidents in the past—from happening. It’s obvious the extended netting placed in 2018 isn’t enough. They need to expand it again. 
 When you go to a ballgame, there are warnings on tickets and in the stadiums, telling you there are dangerous projectiles flying all over you, so pay attention. If you don't want to take the risk, don't go to the game. And if you are at the game, keep your head on a swivel. Injuries happen when people are so enamored with their phones they aren't tracking the action. 
 Putting up netting would make it difficult to watch the game for people who paid good money to see it. Being able to take home game-used balls would also dramatically decrease. The joy of catching a foul ball is part of the in-game experience. Extending the netting even farther would be a mistake. 
 Why don't we ban people from driving their kids in cars to games? They are more at risk there. Seriously, Or if we must, keep kids out of the front rows. But dreaming of catching foul balls is one reason people go to games.",1

 Griz football notebook: Seven more players gone from roster 
 FRANK GOGOLA frank.gogola@missoulian.com 
 Save 
 MISSOULA — Seven Montana Grizzly football players, including Montana native Tanner Wilson, are no longer on the team following recent roster updates. 
 Wilson spent the past two seasons with the Griz after graduating from Polson High School, where he played both offense and defense. The 6-foot-2, 210-pounder had moved from quarterback to defense during spring camp and practiced with the linebackers. 
 Wilson played in one game in 2018 after redshirting in 2017. He rushed one time for minus-3 yards against Idaho on Nov. 10, the second-to-last game of the season. 
 The other players who’ve been removed from the Grizzlies’ roster are redshirt junior Randy Rodriguez, redshirt junior Brennan Corbin, junior cornerback Nick Fouch, and redshirt junior safety/long snapper Caleb Mitchell, redshirt sophomore quarterback Wheeler Harris and redshirt senior safety Jalen Hemphill. 
 Rodriguez played in 10 games in both 2017 and 2018. The Peoria, Arizona, native totaled 29 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, three sacks and one fumble recovery. 
 Corbin, from Anaheim, California, had one reception for 12 yards and one total tackle while playing in four games, all in 2017. He switched from H-back to tight end last spring and transitioned to the defensive line midway through this year’s spring camp. 
 Fouch, from Woodinville, Washington, took the field for one game in two years. 
 Mitchell, from North Bend, Washington, played in one game in three seasons. 
 Harris, an Alabama drop-down from Mesa, Arizona, didn’t see action in his one year at Montana. 
 Hemphill, a Chicago native, didn’t play in any games in his one season with the team. 
 There have been 15 players with remaining eligibility who’ve left the team since the end of the season. In addition to the above departures, the others have been running backs Rey Green and Jeremy Calhoun, quarterback Seamus Hennessy, former Great Falls CMR tight end Jake Olsen, former Billings Senior defensive end Devin Maua, offensive linemen Cody Meyer and Payton Stoner, and kicker Tim Semenza. 
 Green-er pastures 
 Former Griz running back Rey Green has found a home at Division II Central Washington after transferring from Montana. 
 Green, who’s from Vancouver, Washington, played one snap for the Griz in 2018, his redshirt sophomore season. The 5-foot-11, 205-pound running back redshirted as a freshman in 2016 and missed 2017 with an injury.

 “He’s really showing here in the spring and excited about having him next fall — it’s a big one for us,” CWU head coach Chris Fisk told the Ellensburg Daily Record in May. 
 Central Washington’s backfield will return the GNAC Newcomer of the Year, Michael Roots. He and now-graduated running Cedric Cooper combined to rush for 2,092 yards and 27 touchdowns last season. 
 Montana is scheduled to host Central Washington on Sept. 5, 2020, which would be Green’s final season of eligibility. 
 “The situation at Montana wasn’t the right fit for me anymore,” Green told the Daily Record. “Those guys, they had other plans for me, and those aren’t the plans I wanted to go forth with.” 
 Williams finds work 
 Former Griz punter Eric Williams has accepted a job at Goldman Sachs, working in its Salt Lake City branch, he shared on Twitter on Saturday. 
 Williams, a Loyola Sacred Heart grad, will be an analyst in the finance division starting in July. It’s the same division he worked in last summer when he earned a prestigious 10-week internship with Goldman Sachs. 
 “It’s an incredible opportunity to work for the best financial institution in the world,” Williams said. “I expect to work a lot and learn a lot.” 
 Williams was a three-time Academic All-Big Sky selection at Montana. He finished his career seventh on the Grizzlies’ all-time list for yards per punt (40.9). 
 Perfect marks 
 Five Griz posted a 4.0 grade-point average during the 2019 spring semester. They are Glacier grad Evan Epperly, Sidney’s Michael McGinnis, Dante Olson, Brandon Scott and Caleb Mitchell. 
 Thirteen others had a GPA of 3.5 or higher: Big Sky’s Colin Bingham, Butte’s Dylan Cook, Sentinel’s Nick Germer, Butte’s Nate Morin-Ferguson, Glacier’s Brandon Purdy, Billings Senior’s Gabe Sulser, Helena Capital’s Marcus Welnel, Eli Alford, Marcus Knight, Skyler Martin, Reid Miller, Tim Semenza and Dalton Sneed.

 Businesses warn Trump of consequences of new Mexican tariffs

 By JILL COLVIN and COLLEEN LONG Associated Press&nbsp|&nbsp 
 Updated: Fri 11:46 PM, May 31, 2019 
 WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite pushback from U.S. business, Mexico and Capitol Hill, President Donald Trump is doubling down on his threat to slap a 5% tariff on Mexican imports unless America's southern neighbor cracks down on Central American migrants trying to cross the U.S. border. 
 U.S. manufacturers said the tariff, set to take effect June 10, would have devastating consequences on them and American consumers. U.S. stocks tumbled on Wall Street in response to Trump's planned action. 
 ""Imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico is exactly the wrong move,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is exploring legal action in response to the tariffs. ""These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border. Instead, Congress and the president need to work together to address the serious problems at the border."" 
 Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador dispatched his foreign secretary to Washington to try to negotiate a solution. He said social problems are not solved with coercive measures, but also seemed convinced that Trump just needed to be informed about all the steps Mexico has taken to slow illegal migration. 
 Mexico has stepped up raids on migrant caravans traveling through the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca this year. It has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more who wait endlessly for permits that would allow them to travel legally through Mexico. 
 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with his Mexican counterpart via telephone Friday, said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, who's traveling with Pompeo in Bern, Switzerland. Ortagus said the department doesn't comment on details of diplomatic conversations. 
 ""We maintain an ongoing dialogue and close cooperation with Mexico on a wide range of issues, including border security efforts,"" she said. ""The United States and Mexico recognize that managing our shared border is a challenge common to both countries."" 
 Administration officials told reporters in a briefing call Thursday evening that Mexico could prevent the tariffs from kicking in by securing its southern border with Guatemala, cracking down on criminal smuggling organizations, and entering into a ""safe third country agreement"" that would make it difficult for those who enter Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the U.S. 
 ""We fully believe they have the ability to stop people coming in from their southern border and if they're able to do that, these tariffs will either not go into place or will be removed after they go into place,"" said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. 
 Trump said the percentage will gradually increase — up to 25% — until the migration problem is remedied. 
 ""Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades,"" Trump said in a tweet Friday. ""Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!"" 
 Trump's decision showed the administration going to new lengths, and looking for new levers, to pressure Mexico to take action — even if those risk upending other policy priorities, like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal that is the cornerstone of Trump's legislative agenda and seen as beneficial to his reelection effort. 
 Keeping the economy rolling also is critical to Trump's reelection, and business was not happy with the president's planned tariff on Mexican imports. 
 ""These proposed tariffs would have devastating consequences on manufacturers in America and on American consumers,"" said Jay Timmons, chief executive officer of the National Association of Manufacturers. ""We have taken our concerns to the highest levels of the administration and strongly urge them to consider carefully the impact of this action on working families across this country."" 
 The stock market's tumble on Friday all but guarantees that May will be the first monthly loss for the market in 2019. The news hit automakers particularly hard. Many of them import vehicles into the U.S. from Mexico. 
 ""The auto sector — and the 10 million jobs it supports — relies upon the North American supply chain and cross border commerce to remain globally competitive,"" said the Auto Alliance, which represents automakers that built 70% of all cars and light trucks sold in U.S. ""Any barrier to the flow of commerce across the U.S.-Mexico border will have a cascading effect — harming U.S. consumers, threatening American jobs and investment and curtailing economic progress."" 
 Some of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress opposed the tariff. Republican senators have made almost weekly treks to the White House to nudge the president off his trade wars, and this latest move sent them scrambling again to signal their displeasure in hopes of reversing Trump's actions. 
 Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn supports the president's commitment to securing the border, an aide said, but he opposes the across-the-board tariff, ""which will disproportionately hurt Texas."" 
 Key trade senators also spoke up. Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey, who has questioned the administration's ability to invoke national security threats for some other imports, called the tariffs a ""blanket tax increase"" on items Americans purchases from Mexico and ""the wrong remedy."" 
 The tariff threat comes at a peculiar time, given how hard the administration has been pushing for passage of the USMCA, which would update the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a usual Trump ally and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, slammed the president's action, saying it was a ""misuse of presidential tariff authority"" that would burden American consumers and ""seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA."" 
 Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said the livelihoods of farmers and producers from her state are at risk and so is the USMCA. 
 ""If the president goes through with this, I'm afraid progress to get this trade agreement across the finish line will be stifled,"" she said.

 TAIJING WU 
 The Associated Press 
 TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — An artist has erected an inflatable display in Taiwan’s capital to mark an iconic moment in the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. 
 The larger-than-life balloon installation, which stands in front of Taipei’s famous Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, portrays a peaceful encounter between a Chinese civilian and the military tanks that contributed to a brutal shutdown of the demonstrations in Beijing on June 4, 1989. The tank standoff, memorialized by several photographers including Jeff Widener of The Associated Press , has become a symbol of defiance around the world. 
 Hundreds of people walked by the installation Saturday morning. Many took selfies and photos of the artwork, which has been up for a few weeks. 
 While public remembrances of the Tiananmen protests are strictly forbidden in mainland China, there are regular commemorations in democratically governed Taiwan and Hong Kong, China’s semi-autonomous southern region. Next Tuesday marks 30 years since the protests, led by students who were joined by individuals from all walks of life, calling for political reform. 
 China’s ruling Communist Party punishes citizens who dare to speak publicly about the event. While an untold number of people inside China are even unaware of this historic event, others have learned about it through smuggled DVDs and private conversations as well as using software to scale the internet firewall. 
 Mikel Zhang, a lawyer from Shanghai who visited the “Tank Man” installation Saturday morning, said that the students’ beliefs were different than those of the government. “But eventually … blood was shed,” he said. 
 An inscription for the artwork says Taiwan stands with the people who have never ceased to resist the “gigantic autocracy.” 
 Taiwan split from mainland China amid civil war in 1949, though Beijing still claims the island as part of its territory.

 Trump denies instructing Navy about McCain ship 
 The president told reporters as he left the White House on Thursday he 'wasn't involved' in the effort.

 President Donald Trump says he had nothing to do with directing the U.S. Navy to keep a warship named for the late Sen. John McCain out of sight during his visit to Japan this week. 
 Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Thursday he ""wasn't involved"" in the effort. Trump says, ""Somebody did it because they thought I didn't like him,"" but he says he ""would never do a thing like that"" even though he ""wasn't a fan."" 
 The Wall Street Journal first reported Wednesday that a tarp was placed over the warship's name before Trump's arrival and that sailors were instructed to remove any coverings from the ship that included its name. 
 Trump feuded with McCain publicly for years, continuing his criticism even after the Republican senator from Arizona died last year.",1

38884,"Judge says Missouri clinic can keep providing abortions 
  
 Jim Salter And David A. Lieb, The Associated Press 
 Friday 
 May 31, 2019 at 10:14 AM May 31, 2019 at 4:34 PM 
 ST. LOUIS (AP) "" A judge issued an order Friday to keep Missouri's only abortion clinic operating over the objections of state health officials, delivering abortion-rights advocates a courtroom victory after a string of setbacks in legislatures around the U.S. 
 St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer said Planned Parenthood's St. Louis clinic can continue providing abortions despite the Missouri health department's refusal to renew its license over a variety of patient safety concerns. He said the temporary restraining order was necessary to ""prevent irreparable injury"" to Planned Parenthood. 
 With the abortion license set to expire at midnight Friday, Planned Parenthood pre-emptively sued this week and argued that the state was ""weaponizing"" the licensing process. Planned Parenthood said that absent court intervention, Missouri would become the first state without an abortion clinic since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide. 
 The clinic's license will remain in effect until a ruling is issued on Planned Parenthood's request for a permanent injunction, Stelzer's ruling says. A hearing is set for Tuesday morning. 
 ""Today is a victory for women across Missouri, but this fight is far from over,"" Planned Parenthood Federation of America CEO Dr. Leana Wen said in a statement. ""We have seen just how vulnerable access to abortion care is here "" and in the rest of the country."" 
 Republican Gov. Mike Parson said in a written statement that state regulators still have ""serious health and safety concerns regarding Planned Parenthood's abortion facility in St. Louis."" 
 In refusing to renew the license, Missouri's health department cited ""failed surgical abortions in which women remained pregnant"" and legal violations, while insisting that it first needed to interview several clinic physicians who had been reluctant to talk. Planned Parenthood said two staff doctors agreed to interviews, but that others who are contractors or no longer work at the clinic would not talk. 
 The fight over the clinic's license comes as lawmakers in many conservative states are passing new restrictions that take aim at Roe. Abortion opponents, emboldened by new conservative justices on the Supreme Court, are hoping federal courts will uphold laws that prohibit abortions before a fetus is viable outside the womb, the dividing line the high court set in Roe. 
 Louisiana , Georgia , Kentucky , Mississippi and Ohio have enacted bills barring abortion once there's a detectable fetal heartbeat, as early as the sixth week of pregnancy. Parson signed a Missouri bill last week approving an eight-week ban on abortion, with exceptions only for medical emergencies. Alabama has gone even further, outlawing virtually all abortions, even in cases of rape or incest. None of the bans has taken effect, and all are expected to face legal challenges. 
 Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Sarah Felts said the St. Louis clinic continued to perform abortions Friday, including on patients who moved up appointments that had been scheduled for next week. The clinic also provides other services that were not jeopardized by the license dispute. 
 The number of abortions performed in Missouri has declined every year for the past decade, reaching a low of 2,910 last year. Of those, an estimated 1,210 occurred at eight weeks or less of pregnancy, according to preliminary statistics from the state health department. 
 Missouri women also seek abortions in other states. In Kansas, about 3,300 of the 7,000 abortions performed in 2018 were for Missouri residents, according to the state's health department. Illinois does not track the home states of women seeking abortions. 
 An abortion clinic is located just across the Mississippi River in Granite City, Illinois, less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Planned Parenthood facility in St. Louis. Planned Parenthood's abortion clinic in the Kansas City area is in Overland Park, Kansas, just 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the state line. State figures show a handful of Missouri hospitals also perform abortions, but those are relatively rare.

 LOS ANGELES 
 Elton John and the filmmakers of his biopic ""Rocketman"" on Friday sharply criticized a Russian distributor's decision to censor scenes from the new movie. 
 A joint statement by John and the filmmakers said they were unaware that scenes featuring gay sex and drug use would be removed from the film at a screening in Moscow on Thursday. Reports say five minutes of scenes were cut from the film. 
 ""That the local distributor has edited out certain scenes, denying the audience the opportunity to see the film as it was intended is a sad reflection of the divided world we still live in and how it can still be so cruelly unaccepting of the love between two people,"" the statement said. 
 The biopic premieres in the U.S. on Friday and in Russia on June 6.

4034,"Gas prices dip in Austin, will likely fall further 
  
 May 31, 2019 at 1:34 PM May 31, 2019 at 6:12 PM 
 How low will they go? 
 Gasoline prices have dipped in Austin, and industry experts say they expect the price declines to continue. 
 The average gas price in Austin over the past week was $2.45 for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline, according to gasoline price tracker GasBuddy.  That's a 3 cent decline in the past week, a 7 cent drop from a month ago and a 27 cent drop from a year ago. 
 The cheapest gas in the area was $2.17 per gallon and the most expensive gas was $2.89 per gallon, according to the report. GasBuddy provides real-time prices for fuel across the country. 
 The national average price of gas has fallen 2 cents per gallon in the past week to $2.82 per gallon, down 6 cents per gallon from a month ago and down 14 cents per gallon from a year ago. 
 ""With the summer season kicking off, gasoline prices have continued to moderate with nearly all areas off their 2019 high water mark with more declines on the way,"" said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy. 
 The next 90 days could see some ups and downs, but most motorists will experience prices of less than $3 per gallon, DeHaan said. Meanwhile, drivers on the West Coast will likely see prices above $3 per gallon for most of the summer, which is under the $4 per gallon levels they have paid in the past month. 
 ""Overall, the biggest risk factors for rising gas prices this summer: unexpected refinery outages mainly in challenged areas like the Middle East or West Coast, a potential trade deal between the U.S. and China, and any rise in Middle East tensions, mainly between the U.S. and Iran,"" DeHaan said. ""Otherwise expect this summer's gas prices to be similar but lower than they were last year."" 
 The average gas price in Texas is $2.51 for a gallon of regular unleaded, according to the AAA Texas Weekend Gas Watch. That's 5 cents less than a week ago and 27 cents lower compared to a year ago. 
 Drivers in Midland are paying the most on average at $2.76 while drivers in McAllen are paying the least at $2.34 per gallon. 
 The national average for a gallon of regular unleaded is $2.82, which is 2 cents less than a week ago and 14 cents lower than the price per gallon at this time last year. 
 Stable crude oil prices are helping push prices down at the pump despite tight domestic gasoline supply and strong demand, auto club AAA Texas said. But an increase in demand could send prices back up, AAA Texas said. 
 ""Gas prices have declined, on average by a dime for many areas of Texas since the beginning of May and that's a trend drivers can expect to continue into early June,"" said Daniel Armbruster, AAA Texas spokesman. ""However, if demand for retail gasoline increases further, that bump could cause prices to go back up slightly.""

 Jurgen Klopp is looking to win the Champions League at the third time of asking as a manager (Image: GETTY) 
 That’s the verdict of former Liverpool midfielder Paul Ince. 
 The Reds face Premier League rivals Tottenham at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid this evening (8pm) in what is their second successive final in the competition. 
 Klopp will hope, having lost three finals as Liverpool manager, that the Merseyside outfit can finally end their seven-year wait for silverware against Spurs. 
 The German oversaw Liverpool’s best ever Premier League season this year, guiding them to a club-record 97 points, only to lose out on the league title by one point to Manchester City.

 Liverpool also came close but not close enough in the Champions League last year when a first-half injury to key man Mohamed Salah saw their hopes of victory unravel as they went on to lose 3-1 to Real Madrid in Kiev. 
 Klopp also lost the finals of the League Cup and the Europa League in his first season in charge with a maiden trophy at Anfield having thus far evaded him. 
 And Ince - who played for Liverpool for two years from 1997 to 1999 - thinks that if Klopp loses a fourth straight final with Liverpool then he should give domestic cup competitions greater priority next year. 
 In 2018-19, he fielded second-strength teams and crashed out in third round of both the Carabao Cup - losing 2-1 at home to Chelsea - and the FA Cup, when they lost 2-1 at Wolves.

 Perhaps it would be a case of putting more focus in securing a League Cup or an FA Cup 
 Paul Ince 
 Liverpool have not progressed past the fourth round of either competition in the past two seasons. 
 And Ince has recommended that Klopp look to change that next year just to end their trophy drought if they are beaten by Spurs, though the 51-year-old slammed claims that the manager is a ‘bottler’ if they do lose out in Madrid. 
 “I hear people saying that if Klopp loses this final, he’s a bottler,” Ince told bookmaker Paddy Power. 
 “Let me tell you something right now, people who say things like that - I can’t even find the word to describe them. 
 “How can you call Liverpool bottlers? They’ve pushed City to the last game of the season, they’re in the Champions League final and they were in it last year too.

 Liverpool star Wijnaldum reveals ‘special’ relationship with Spurs ace 
 “Yes, they were nervous and lost out, but they’ve clearly not let it get to them. 
 “It’s completely disrespectful to call them or Klopp a bottler. We all know that as a manager you have to win some silverware, but [Tottenham boss Mauricio] Pochettino is in the same position. 
 “Both teams have proved that when they can dig in and get a result. When you look what’s happened since Klopp took over - he’s done an amazing job, a job no one else could have come in and done. 
 “The only thing I would say is that if Klopp fails to win this weekend, perhaps it would be a case of putting more focus in securing a League Cup or an FA Cup, to ensure you have trophies in the cabinet and the winning mentality. 
 “But, to call Liverpool or Klopp a ‘bottler’ is a disgrace - utterly ridiculous, whether they win or lose.”

 Spring! Glorious spring! The wonderful time of year when what looks dead comes to life! 
 Crombie 
 It’s refreshing to see the brand-new grass and leaves and flowers budding and bursting forth with new life. The fragrant blossoms and rich colors are always a welcome smell and sight to behold. Along with them are the variety of birds that come back after a long winter. It’s amazing how quickly the hummingbirds show up when we put our feeder out again. 
 The hummingbirds always find what they’re looking for. In life there’s always going to be good news and disturbing news. Joys and sorrows. What we focus on is our choice. The hummingbird and the vulture always find what they’re looking for. 
 Proverbs 11:27 says, “If you search for good, you will find favor; but if you search for evil, it will find you!” 
 The hummingbird is always looking for something sweet. They’re attracted to what’s colorful and beautiful and alive. And they find it. The vulture is always on the lookout for what’s dead, lifeless and rotting, and that’s what they find. It’s not to say the hummingbird doesn’t fly by the occasional roadkill, but that’s not its focus. In the opposite way, the vulture soars high above the occasional ditches filled with colorful wildflowers, but that’s not the object of its attention. They’re not searching for what’s alive, they’re looking for what’s dead. 
 In this world there will always be weddings and funerals. We’ll find no end to things good and bad. The key to being filled in these days with encouragement, joy and peace or anxiety, despair and hopelessness is what we choose to focus our attention on. The apostle Paul encouraged the Philippian believers by writing, “whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable — if anything is excellent or praiseworthy — think about such things.” 
 Paul wrote these words while in prison even though innocent. It’s not just positive thinking. It’s not living in denial of evil, it’s biblical living and thinking that brings life! Search for the good — you’ll find it!

20892,"Bristol Eastern softball battles, falls short in quarterfinal 
 Written by ZACK CARPENTER 
 @ZACKCARPENTERBP 
 MONROE - The three words Bristol Eastern softball head coach Scott Redman repeated three times Friday afternoon perfectly described his team’s identity all year and its attitude in its final game of the season. 
 “We battled back,” he said. 
 The Lancers had a propensity of grinding and rallying throughout the spring. That fight was on display once again Friday. But this time, seventh-seeded Eastern came up short in a 5-3 loss to second-seeded Masuk in a Class L state quarterfinal game. 
 After going down 1-0 in the first inning following an RBI single from Panthers pitcher Sam Schiebe, it was Lancers eight-hole hitter Riley Giblin showing some fortitude. The sophomore turned on an inside pitch and mashed a solo home run on Schiebe’s first delivery of the third inning to tie the score. 
 The moment the ball lasered off Giblin’s bat, her teammates began screaming as on-deck hitter Grace D’Amato sprinted to home plate, squatted and flexed toward Giblin, who received a hard low-five from Redman as she rounded third with a smile. 
 “All year, we’ve talked about production in the bottom of the order,” Redman said. “That’s a kid who hasn’t been the hottest hitter but has all the talent in the world. She finally gets ahold of one, which is a testament to her hard work, trying to keep grinding and grinding to get out of a slump.” 
 And after Schiebe added another RBI single in the fourth - and after the Panthers (21-1) took advantage of a Lancers (17-6) error in the fifth to score two runs and take a 4-1 lead - the Lancers’ perseverance showed up again even when things looked bleak. 
 “There was one point where it was real close to falling apart,” Redman said. 
 After the Panthers plated those two crucial runs, there was an uneasy feeling that things might begin to unravel. But senior catcher Paige McLaughlin called Eastern into a huddle in the circle, and the team relaxed. 
 Three batters later, Lancer starter Erin Girard - who allowed five runs (three earned) on nine hits with four walks and two strikeouts - was out of the inning. The junior stranded runners on second and third as part of 11 Panthers she left on base. 
 In the sixth, Taylor Keegan blooped a first-pitch single just past the glove of Masuk shortstop Katie Welch, clipping the edge of the outfield grass to start a rally. McLaughlin then roped a first-pitch double to dead-center, and moments later Keegan scored on a passed ball. Zoe Lowe then punched an RBI single up the middle to cut Eastern’s deficit to 4-3 with no outs. 
 Schiebe, however, continued her brilliant senior season with yet another terrific outing, cutting down the final three batters on an Alison Tellier sacrifice bunt, getting the better of Alyssa Hackling in a tense one-on-one battle that featured three straight foul balls and then stranding Lowe at third with a strikeout. 
 Schiebe finished with three runs allowed (two earned) on five hits with 11 strikeouts and two walks in a complete game. 
 After the Panthers added an insurance run on a smoked RBI single up the middle from Welch, center fielder Lowe gunned a Masuk runner at the plate by a mile to keep the score at 5-3. Girard then induced an inning-ending fly out. 
 Girard sparked another potential rally, leading off the seventh by poking a two-strike single to right-center, but Schiebe shut down the next three Lancer hitters to send Masuk to the state semifinals. 
 “If you had told me we were gonna score three runs today, I would’ve been OK with that, to be honest with you,” Redman said. “I would’ve said if we could play clean defense, we would be in the game. Even without clean defense, we were still in the game. I can’t complain.” 
 In the end, Redman circled back to what made his team special all season. They never surrendered, even though they were pitted against one of the state’s best in what he described as a semifinals-type of atmosphere - facing the defending Class L state champion and now the favorite to win it with top-seeded St. Joseph’s loss in the second round. 
 “It’s hard to be too upset when you lose to one of the best,” Redman said. “Although we came up short, I’m proud of their ability to not fold and keep fighting.”",1

 The Williston Herald polled members of the Coyotes baseball team on a few questions during their trip to the state baseball tournament in Minot. Here were some of their unique answers. 
 What is your favorite pre-game meal? 
 • Zach Carson: McDonald’s apple pie and strawberry shake. As a team we always go to McDonald’s on road trips, and when I was younger, me and my best friend would always go there and get that before and after my games. 
 • Jaxson Meyer: A peanut butter and jelly sandwich because it’s easy to make and tastes good, but I do get tired of it after awhile. 
 What is your favorite song or artist to hear during a game and why? 
 • Kyle Mischke: Before He Cheats by Carrie Underwood because it makes me feel powerful. 
 • Jack Heen: My favorite song to hear during the game is Danger Zone because we are big Top Gun fans. 
 Do you have any pre-game or in-game superstitions? 
 • Camdin Miller: I put my left cleat on, then my right cleat, and I always strap my batting gloves together before I put them back in my helmet. I also hit my bat on Brady Doeden’s bat after he gets a hit. 
 • Zach Carson: I never step on the line or dirt through the base path. And when I’m pitching, I always wear the same Under Armour sliding shorts. I also pray before and during each inning before I step on the mound. 
 How old were you when you first played baseball and what is your earliest baseball memory? 
 • Dale Kjorstad: I was four or five years old. I remember hitting the ball off a tee at the farm, and the dog would go get it and bring it back. As a little kid, I thought that was the coolest thing ever. 
 • Jaxson Meyer: Probably at around five years old. After our t-ball games in the morning, we would all get donuts and slushies and just have fun at the field. 
 Who is your favorite baseball player and why? 
 • Charlie Whitlock: My teammate Garret Hill because he’s silky smooth. 
 • Brady Aberle: Rod Carew because he taught me so much about the game at his camps. 
 Finish this sentence: I love baseball because... 
 • Denver Sheets: I get to be with my friends everyday and win. 
 • Christopher Sathe: I love baseball because of how much fun I have playing it. 
 Do you plan to play baseball after high school? If so, where? 
 • Garret Hill: Yes, somewhere that is warm. 
 • Christopher Sathe: I am going to the University of Jamestown to play baseball next year.

 Serena Williams joins No. 1 Osaka on way out of French Open 
 PARIS (AP) - Serena Williams' quest for a 24th Grand Slam title ended with her earliest loss at a major tournament in five years. 
 Williams was outplayed in the third round of the French Open by 20-year-old American Sofia Kenin, who used clean, deep groundstrokes to put together the 6-2, 7-5 upset Saturday. 
 It was the second significant surprise in a matter of hours: Earlier in the day, No. 1 seed Naomi Osaka was eliminated 6-4, 6-2 by 42nd-ranked Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic. That ended Osaka's 16-match Grand Slam winning streak, which included titles at the U.S. Open final in September - when she beat Williams in the final - and at the Australian Open in January. 
 Osaka was trying to become the first woman to win three consecutive major trophies since Williams grabbed four in a row in 2014-15, a run that was preceded by a second-round loss at Roland Garros and a third-round loss at Wimbledon. 
 Since those early-for-her defeats, Williams had won six of the 14 majors she entered to surpass Steffi Graf's professional-era record of 22 Grand Slam singles championships. With 23, Williams stands one away from Margaret Court's mark for the most in tennis history; Court played in both the professional and amateur eras. 
 Williams, who is 37, sat out four Slams in 2017-18 while she was off the tour to have a baby. Her first major tournament back was last year's French Open, where she withdrew before a fourth-round match because of a chest muscle injury. She went on to reach the finals of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, before wasting match points during a quarterfinal loss at the Australian Open. 
 Williams came to Paris having played only four matches since then; she withdrew from two tournaments because of an injured left knee and another because of illness. 
 She struggled through her opening match at the French Open, which she has won three times, and again against the 35th-ranked Kenin, who never before had made it to the round of 16 at a major. 
 But Kenin played quite well, never showing a trace of nerves. It was Williams whose strokes were off-target: Her 34 unforced errors were twice as many as Kenin's total. 
 Remarkably, Kenin broke Williams four times, while only ceding one of her own service games.

48449,"Don't pet the cat 
 It’s called ‘wildlife’ for a reason Today at 1:58 a.m. 0comments 
 Every now and again you'll get word about someone who figures an animal can be taken from the woods and made into a family pet. Especially in Arkansas. And this bad idea isn't limited to squirrels and fawns. 
 The most recent example of why wildlife should remain wild comes from the wonderful volunteers at Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge in Eureka Springs. 
 Somebody had apparently taken in a pair of bobcat kittens from the wild last October. The animals, named Tony and Prince, were kept in little dog cages and sometimes allowed to exercise in a small dog run. To top it off, these critters were only fed cat food by their previous owner, officials said. 
 For the record, bobcats are carnivores and need meat. They eat things like woodchucks, rabbits, skunks, moles, squirrels, birds and reptiles. They won't thrive on Meow Mix. 
 Perhaps the worst part is these animals were simply left in their cages and would have likely drowned in a flood the other day if police had not been contacted. 
 Fortunately, Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge staff retrieved the bobcats and will properly care for them in ways a private citizen can't. 
 What frustrates most about this story is the person who took the bobcats from the wild didn't break the law. According to the Arkansas Game and Fish website, any Arkansas resident can take up to six (six!) bobcats, coyotes, foxes, raccoons, opossums, squirrels, quail or rabbits from the wild without penalty. Hopefully this will be addressed through future legislation. 
 There's plenty of great choices for pets out there. You can pick fish, dogs, cats, snakes, goats and more. We know someone that has a pet bearded lizard. We ask that they keep it in the cage when we're over, but it's still a better choice than a bobcat. If all else fails, head down to your local shelter to find a new friend. You'll both be a lot happier. 
 Best of luck to Tony and Prince. Sorry you had to endure terrible living spaces and a poor diet. We hope you'll have a better future with other big cats in the sanctuary.

16344,"Estate agent grabs hair dye gloves, delivers baby in show-house bathroom 
 13:30 01/06/2019 
 Tammy Petersen 
 Armed with a pair of gloves from a hair dyeing kit, a Cape Town estate agent who had gone to show a house in Table View instead used her past veterinary nurse skills to help a woman give birth to a healthy baby. 
 ""I have lost count of how many animals I had brought into the world, but a human baby? I am still recovering. I am overwhelmed,"" a modest Kim Hansen told News24 on Saturday, still incredulous that she had used her knowledge to deliver the boy while waiting for an ambulance to arrive. 
 Hansen arrived at the house on Friday for a 16:00 viewing and while showing the potential buyers the property, she heard ""gut-wrenching screams"" coming from one of the granny flats. 
 Suggesting that her clients rather return some other time, she saw them off before trying to find out from the frantic elderly homeowners what was causing the commotion. 
 ""The man said he was trying to call an ambulance. When I went to look what was happening, I found the domestic worker standing on her feet, in the process of giving birth in the bathroom,"" Hansen said. 
 ""The baby was halfway out. Knowing what I know about the ambulance service in this country, I realised that the baby would be born before they even got there. So I told myself, 'Get your shit together, Kim'."" 
 And that's what she did. 
 ""As an ex-veterinary nurse, I asked myself how much different could it be to give birth to a human? I requested gloves and the only ones they had was form a hair dye kit. It was good enough because we managed to deliver a beautiful baby boy."" 
 She tied the newborn's umbilical cord with a piece of string before cutting it because clothing pegs had not been tight enough. 
 ""I didn't panic because I told myself that God was with me. He was a bit small, but his colouring looked fine. I checked his vitals, patted him on the back, got the mucus out of his mouth and there he was: a very healthy baby,"" Hansen said proudly. 
 The grateful mom thanked her repeatedly before the ambulance arrived to take her to hospital. 
 ""It was divine intervention – I was meant to be there. I would never leave someone who was in need of help,"" Hansen maintained. 
 ""It was a blessing to have been part of this; I am humbled."" 
 The new mom is in need of financial assistance, and Hansen appealed to those able to donate anything from diapers to money for a doctor’s appointment to contact Trust Property via their Facebook page .

 Friday 
 May 31, 2019 at 9:57 PM Jun 1, 2019 at 12:04 AM 
 JEKYLL ISLAND - The Savannah Morning News was named the state's top newspaper for its work in 2018. The winner of the General Excellence Award was announced Friday evening at the Georgia Press Association's 133rd annual convention. It was the fifth win in six years for the newspaper, which competes in the state's largest circulation category. 
 The winners of the association's 2019 Better Newspaper Contest were announced Friday at the group's 133rd annual convention. 
 ""We are honored to have been named the General Excellence Award winner again this year,"" said Michael Traynor, publisher of the Savannah Morning News and savannahnow.com.  ""Our journalists work around the clock to provide local news and information that is timely, necessary and accurate.  We are proud that their efforts have been recognized."" 
 Reporter Jan Skutch and Editorial Page Editor Adam Van Brimmer won the Community Service Award for their work on the lack of transparency and consistency of the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles.

 Mimi Sheriff is hoping the incoming government will learn from the past — and not blame political enemies for it, too. (John Gushue/CBC) 
 Dear new Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, 
 In full disclosure, while I am Canadian, I'm one of the many Canadians who have a colourful history and pieces of their heart in different countries. 
 I give you this background because I think context is important. I dance and sing to The Islander with as much enthusiasm and joy as anyone either born or bred a Newfoundlander — I am a proud islander — by choice. 
 With that said, having lived here for exactly a decade this September, the question I get the most is ""Why did you come here?"" 
 Don't get me wrong, this is a perfectly reasonable question. It's the accompanying look of sheer confusion, concern and sometimes humour that's interesting. In my experience, barring the terrible weather, most Newfoundlanders and Labradorians don't understand and are fascinated why anyone with a choice, would live here. 
 No one expects you or your plans to be perfect — you'll be rewarded in voter confidence for being authentic. 
  
 I believe this confusion is symptomatic of the current doom and gloom rhetoric underpinning the province's economic and political landscape. 
 In fact, it's why I'm writing this letter. 
 The Newfoundland and Labrador legislature. (Rob Antle/CBC) 
 We have to move to a point where some of us aren't constantly second-guessing our decision and feel like we're making a mistake by living here. 
 Just as the St. John's fog eventually fades out the water and ships, I'm sure by now the euphoria over your wins has faded and you're now trying to figure out your role in the minority government . 
 First, congratulations and thank you for putting yourselves forward for civil service. I always try to be cognizant of Theodore Roosevelt's advice that ""It's not the critic that counts…[t]he credit belongs to the [woman or] man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly."" 
 The job you've signed up for isn't easy. But, we all want you to succeed. The following are four pieces of advice from a 30-something, townie(ish), working professional voter. 
 1. Find a new colour scheme. 
 It's safe to say that this election was about many voters being dissatisfied and wanting change. A word of caution to the Progressive Conservative and New Democratic parties — it's not that voters necessarily voted for you and your mandates, but they voted against the Liberal party. Therefore you shouldn't enter this new collaborative government believing your place there means that your policies and plans were superior. We all fail that way. You still have to prove yourselves and need to quickly figure out together how to take your red and blue books and make a joint purple book, with a splash of orange. 
 2. Be bold. Innovate. 
 We all know there are big issues to address — in your leadership we're looking for bold and innovative plans. Nothing great comes without hard work and tough decisions. If you need people to sacrifice for a defined end goal, explain it, quantify it and provide progress updates towards it. History will be kind to you. 
 3. Stop blaming each other. 
 None of us can change the past — move forward. The present and future are more important. Continually talking about the past and blaming each other is worrying. It makes us think there's a lack of vision for the future. 
 4. Tell the truth. 
 Someone smart once said, ""If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything."" You are all human and we are not infallible. Try things, make mistakes, but own them. No one expects you or your plans to be perfect — you'll be rewarded in voter confidence for being authentic. 
 Truthfully, I have a lot more I want to share, but we all have work to get back to and I promised only four pieces of advice.",1

4933,"North Dakota tribe defends its rights to minerals from state 
 Print 
 Saturday, June 01 2019 
 AP 
 FARGO, N.D. (AP) — For nearly two centuries, the federal government has repeatedly assured a Native American tribe in North Dakota that it has rights to a reservation river and the issue stayed relatively quiet until oil companies figured out a way to drill under the waterway, which is now a man-made lake. 
 With an estimated $100 million in oil royalties waiting in escrow to be claimed and future payments certain to come, the state has become more involved in seeking ownership rights. It successfully lobbied the U.S. Interior Department to suspend a last-minute Obama-era memo stating that mineral rights under the original Missouri River bed should belong to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, which is also known as the Three Affiliated Tribes. 
 The Interior Department put the minerals issue on hold last summer and ordered a review of the ""underlying historical record."" The state maintains that it assumed ownership of the riverbed when North Dakota became a state in 1889, citing a constitutional principle known as the equal footing doctrine. 
 The state's immersion in the issue isn't sitting well with tribal members, who say it's between them and the Trump administration. 
 ""They obviously didn't care that much before,"" the tribal chairman, Mark Fox, recently told The Associated Press. ""Now that there might be $100 million there, all of a sudden the state really cares, right?"" 
 The January 2017 memo by former Interior Department Solicitor Hilary Tompkins, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation, is one of numerous federal declarations since the 1820s that have confirmed the tribes' ownership of the river, which was altered when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Garrison Dam in the 1950s and created Lake Sakakawea. 
 In her ruling, Tompkins cited both a 1936 opinion by the Interior Department that granted the tribes ownership of a Missouri River island and a wider-ranging 1979 conclusion by the Interior Board of Land Appeals that the entire bed of the river within the reservation boundaries didn't pass to North Dakota's control when it became a state. The state didn't appeal the 1979 decision, which Tompkins said rejected the relevance of the equal footing doctrine. 
 Tribal officials have recently taken to social media and penned op-eds asking state leaders to come out in support of the tribes' ownership rights, much like they did during the last legislative session regarding an oil and tax agreement with the tribes. 
 ""I hope our elected officials will join us once again in supporting our lawful property rights to the minerals under the Missouri River on the Fort Berthold Reservation,"" Fox wrote in an op-ed kicking off the campaign. 
 The opinion by Tompkins, who said her conclusions are backed by a 2001 Supreme Court opinion giving an Idaho tribe ownership of submerged lands, came out two days before President Donald Trump's inauguration. Although Trump held a meeting later that year to pledge his support to Native American leaders in oil country, including Fox, state government officials in Republican-dominated North Dakota have found receptive ears at the Interior Department. 
 State Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem wrote a letter in October 2017 to James Cason, associate deputy secretary in the Interior Department and longtime conservative operative, stating that the Tompkins opinion has flaws and asking that it be withdrawn or suspended. ""I wholeheartedly support a 're-set' and encourage discussions that have as their objective an amicable resolution to the title question,"" Stenehjem wrote. 
 Principal Deputy Solicitor Daniel Jorjani complied with that request in June 2018, after which the National Congress of American Indians passed a resolution urging the Interior Department to complete title and mapping work of the riverbed and scrap Jorjani's opinion. 
 Stenehjem told the AP that Fox's op-ed focusing on strong relationships between tribal and state governments should be a ""means to resolve any of these issues."" Asked if that meant sharing some of the royalties, the attorney general said, ""Conceivably, yes."" He added that those conversations would go through Republican Gov. Doug Burgum. 
 Burgum's spokesman, Mike Nowatzki, said in a statement that Burgum is committed to partnering and engaging in productive dialogue with ""all tribal nations for the benefit of all North Dakotans,"" but added that any public statements on the riverbed minerals issue would be premature. The Interior Department did not respond to requests for comment. 
 Fox said tribal elders have told him to ""fight and fight hard for what our people died for over hundreds of years."" He said he believes it's his responsibility to right some of the wrongs, including ""one of the greatest devastating blows to our people,"" the construction of Garrison Dam. 
 ""We have a connection to the river that goes back thousands of years,"" Fox said. ""It's not just cultural, it's not only spiritual, it has also historically been our economic foundation of who we are."" 
 Fox said the tribes have spent their oil money wisely. He cited a new courthouse, $130 million worth of road repairs, construction of more than 400 homes, a new drug treatment facility, health insurance for 7,000 enrolled members, improvements in law enforcement, a $20 million education fund for students, and $200 million in infrastructure upgrades, among other things. 
 Tribal elder Austin Gillette, 72, who was in first grade when his town of Elbowoods was flooded out by Lake Sakakawea, and 90 percent of reservation residents were forced to relocate, remembers it as the first time he saw adults cry. 
 ""Water is life,"" said Gillette, a former tribal chairman and council member. ""We just want the state to go away on this issue.""

 Closure of Middletown Library delayed thanks to volunteers 
 Jun 1, 2019 
 Save 
 LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- The Middletown Library will not close for good this weekend as originally scheduled after a deal was reached between city officials. 
 Saturday morning, Louisville Free Public Library Director Lee Burchfield informed a member of Metro Council that the branch will remain open temporarily. 
 Metro Councilman Markus Winkler, D-17th, represents part of the east end and has been fighting to delay the closure. 
 Both the Middletown and Fern Creek branches were scheduled to close for good on Monday, June 3, as a result of Mayor Greg Fischer's budget cuts. 
 Winkler was pushing to keep the branch open until the new Northeast Regional Library opens on June 24. 
 Volunteers are being recruited to help pack and move the Middletown branch so its employees can stay on the job. 
 ""What we'd like to do is use volunteers to help in that ramp down period by breaking down boxes, boxing up books, that would allow us to keep the library staff focused on staffing the library, and we could close much, much closer to that 24th deadline,"" Winkler said. 
 As a result, the branch will remain open until at least June 19. 
 The library will still be closed on Monday, June 3, as originally scheduled, but will reopen Tuesday. 
 ""Our libraries are a critical resource for our community. During this budget challenge, the offers of help from volunteers, businesses, schools and nonprofit partners to step up and address gaps have demonstrated our community's deep social muscle,"" Mayor Fischer said in a release Saturday. 
 Winkler said the goal is to shorten the gap in service for students on summer break. 
 ""This is a testament to what happens when we work together for the good of our city, and I am grateful for this outcome,"" Winkler said in a statement. 
 Officials say library hours could vary depending on how much staff is available, but visitors can still pick up items on hold and have access to library computers and Wi-Fi. Updates will be posted on the library website here . 
 Additional summer programs for kids have also been planned, including a community bookmobile and pop-up storytimes until the Northeast Regional Library opens. 
 Below is a schedule of those activities: 
 June 5: Bookmobile visit from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and storytime at 10 a.m. 
 June 12: Storytime at 10 a.m. 
 June 19: Storytime at 10 a.m. 
 Public Bookmobile Visits - to include materials for checkout and a summer reading program: 
 June 8: 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. in the parking lot/park/porch of the Northeast Regional Library . 
 June 10 and 17: 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. in the parking lot/park/porch of the Northeast Regional Library .

 Get sneak peek at new minor league baseball stadium for Trash Pandas 
 By Eric Schultz | AL.com | Posted June 01, 2019 at 08:02 AM | Updated June 01, 2019 at 08:20 AM 
 Comment 
 The new minor league baseball stadium now under-construction at Town Madison is plainly visible to motorists on Interstate 565. The $46 million, 7,500-seat stadium is on schedule to be completed in plenty of time for the first game, set for April 15, 2020. 
 The ballpark's highlights include: 
 -- A grassy berm will be available with a general admission ticket to spread out your blanket and watch the game from the right field corner. 
 -- A restaurant/bar will look over right field similar to the Chop House at the Atlanta Braves’ SunTrust Park. 
 -- The stadium will have 360-degree accessibility so fans can walk all the way around it 
 -- Sod for the field is expected to be installed this summer.

 Photographs of what appears to be a giant flaming-orange bird flying over a national park might initially be called a hoax. CGI or a camera anomaly … if the airspace it was spotted in wasn’t above the Grand Teton National Park which was closed at the time because of a mysterious crack … a crack that was less than ten miles from Yellowstone National Park, home of the largest supervolcano in North America which has been the center of hundreds of recent mini-earthquakes, unusual geyser activity and plenty of “nothing to worry about” comments from officials swamped with “should we be worried?” calls. And now a giant bird. Are you worried yet? 
 The photos (seen here ) appeared in a video (seen here ) uploaded by YouTube’s MrMBB333, who keeps an eye on seismic activities around the world. The bird segment starts at around the 2:00 minute mark and was reportedly taken from an unmanned webcam near Jenny Lake, a glacial lake in the Wyoming park. 
 Both MrMBB333 and other sites showing the photos refer to it as a “fire” bird or “fiery bird” and naturally try to link it to the flaming Phoenix of Greek and Roman mythology. Some commenters say that if it’s real, it could be a golden eagle (native to the park but more brown that bright gold) or a big hawk (see “golden eagle” disqualification). As usual, magnification doesn’t make things any clearer. While the alleged flying thing looks huge, it could just be the perspective. Under normal circumstances, the needle on this one would point towards “highly skeptical.” Except … 
 Golden eagle 
 Park rangers at The Grand Teton National Park have closed until further notice the area around a mysterious and growing 100-foot-long crack in a rock buttress above the Hidden Falls viewing area near … wait for it … Jenny Lake! Discovered on July 10, park rangers are concerned a 100-by-20-by-20-foot rock piece could break off and fall directly onto the usual crowds of tourists in the Hidden Falls viewing area. They have installed time-lapse cameras to take pictures of the fissure every 15 minutes and are using a new structure-from-motion technique which converts phots and GPS reading into three-dimensional models. 
 It’s unclear whether the puzzling giant-bird-like-apparition photos were taken by one of these monitoring cameras nor is it clear which came first – the crack or the creature. There don’t seem to be any other photos or witnesses. Because its color resembles fire, no one seems to be linking it to the Native American legend of the Thunderbird (see “golden eagle” disqualification again) … unless it’s symbolically ‘going down in flames’ over what may be a falling rock … or a supervolcano eruption. 
 Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park 
 It’s never wise to discount mysterious cracks, quakes, geysers or other seismic activities in and around Yellowstone National Park. As far as believing in flaming birds … anything real or imaginary that draw attention to the aforementioned “nothing to worry about” signs is greatly appreciated.

 US Catholic Church reports big rise in sex-abuse allegations

 AP National Writer 
 NEW YORK (AP) - Quantifying its vast sex-abuse crisis, the U.S. Roman Catholic Church said Friday that allegations of child sex abuse by clerics more than doubled in its latest 12-month reporting period, and that its spending on victim compensation and child protection surged above $300 million. 
 During the period from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018, 1,385 adults came forward with 1,455 allegations of abuse, according to the annual report of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' Secretariat of Child and Youth Protection. That was up from 693 allegations in the previous year. The report attributed much of the increase to a victim compensation program implemented in five dioceses in New York state. 
 AlertMe 
 According to the report, Catholic dioceses and religious orders spent $301.6 million during the reporting period on payments to victims, legal fees and child-protection efforts. That was up 14% from the previous year and double the amount spent in the 2014 fiscal year. 
 The number of allegations is likely to rise further during the current fiscal year, given that Catholic dioceses in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have started large compensation programs in the wake of a scathing Pennsylvania grand jury report released in August. The grand jury identified more than 300 priests in six of the state's dioceses who have been credibly accused of child sexual abuse committed over many decades. 
 Since then, attorneys general in numerous states have set up abuse hotlines and launched investigations, and a growing number of dioceses and Catholic religious orders have released names of priests accused of abuse. 
 ""Victims are coming forward now because of real progress by secular authorities,"" said the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests. ""Lawmakers are increasingly getting rid of archaic, predator-friendly laws and 16 attorneys general have launched investigations, so many victims are feeling hopeful."" 
 The advocacy group urged officials in every diocese to turn over sex abuse records to their state attorney general for investigation. The group also said church staff should be instructed to report suspected abuse to secular law enforcement before filing a report internally. 
 According to a survey included in the new annual report, more than 90% of the alleged abusers were already dead or removed from the ministry. Most of the reported abuse occurred between 1960 and 1990, with a peak in the 1970s. 
 Compilation of the annual report entails an audit of Catholic dioceses across the U.S. to assess their compliance with a 2002 charter outlining the church's child-protection policies. Only one diocese, based in Lincoln, Nebraska, was found noncompliant due to lack of transparency in public communications about child sex abuse cases. 
 Members of the audit team made on-site visits to more than one-third of the 196 U.S. dioceses and found shortcomings in 14% of them that will warrant follow-up visits. Among the problems detected were poor record-keeping of background-check data, and allowing some clergy, staff and volunteers to have contact with children without undergoing training or background checks. 
 The findings were evidence of ""complacency and lack of diligence on the part of some dioceses,"" said a letter included in the report from Francesco Cesareo, who chairs a review board created by the bishops in 2002 to monitor sex abuse prevention efforts. 
 Referring to the Pennsylvania grand jury report, and the abuse allegations that led to the defrocking of former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick , Cesareo said the events ""have led to both frustration and anger among the faithful in the Church, a loss of the credibility of the hierarchy, and a questioning of the efficacy of the audit itself."" 
 The introductory section of the annual report said the McCarrick scandal and the grand jury report helped turn complacency into urgency, and it commended some of the steps taken in response. 
 ""While it is unfortunate that it took such grave sins and crimes to spur action, as Catholics, we are grateful that God can bring good out of such evils,"" the report said. ""However, there remains work to be done."" 
 Specifically, the report urged new steps to address the accountability of bishops engaged in abuse or cover-ups, as well as increased involvement of lay experts in investigating abuse allegations. 
 Those issues are expected to be discussed at the bishops' upcoming national meeting in Baltimore starting June 11.

 Not the first time this has happened, Professor Cleveland...check out the Galipolli Letter involving our trusted friends in Australia and the UK     ""When he resumed his examination, Pickford pressed Murdoch on one of the most sensational – and unsubstantiated – allegations in his letter: that “an order had to be issued to officers to shoot without mercy any soldier who lagged behind or loitered in advance” during the August offensive.    Pickford: Did you get that information from any responsible person?    Murdoch: I forget where I got it.    Pickford: It is a very serious allegation.    Murdoch: I do not think it is so serious. It was the diary of a British officer which I saw on the spot.    Pickford: Do you mean a living officer or a dead officer?    Murdoch: A living officer.    Pickford: I should like to know who it was.    Murdoch: I do not know his name. I cannot inform you. All I know is that Mr Nevinson (British correspondent Henry Nevinson) had that diary and it was confirmed, I remember, by an officer from Suvla who I met on the transport returning from Mudros. I do not know his name. He was an artillery officer who had been through Suvla.    Pickford: It is unfortunate you do not remember his name.    Murdoch: It is very hard to remember names. It is a long time ago.    When Welsh MP Walter Roch picked up the questioning, Murdoch would then reveal not only that many of the most damaging allegations he had made in his letter were wrong or unsubstantiated but, much more seriously, that he had deliberately lied to ensure his objective “to startle the government” into abandoning the Dardanelles campaign.""    http://insidestory.org.au/the-myth-of-keith-murdochs-gallipoli-letter/

 Let’s Talk About Bladder Cancer: Tips for Getting the Support You Need [Video] 
 Brandpoint (BPT) 
 Save 
 Sorry, but your browser does not support the video tag. 
 (BPT) - Approximately 80,000 Americans are diagnosed with bladder cancer each year. Despite the number of people diagnosed, many people feel isolated and embarrassed when it comes to sharing information about their symptoms – even with doctors. 
 If you’ve recently been diagnosed, it’s important to remember that there is no shame in living with bladder cancer. Talking about something so personal can feel overwhelming at first, but open communication with your care team is an important first step. 
 The following tips are intended to help start a dialogue toward getting your questions answered. Don’t let the fear of discussing bladder cancer prevent you from getting the care and support you need. The more you practice, the easier it will become. 
 Before appointments, do your homework. 
 Visits with your doctor will go by fast, so show up prepared to make the most of the time you have together. Between appointments, keep a daily diary of your symptoms and be sure to note if you experience anything new or unusual. Also make a list of questions you have – about medicines, surgery, intimacy, and how you are feeling – and bring it with you. It’s easy to get nervous and forget the things you want to ask so having a list will help you feel more confident in getting the answers you need. 
 This is your time, so don’t worry about asking too many questions. Dr. Elisabeth Heath from the Karmanos Cancer Institute at Wayne State University reminds patients, “You should not leave that doctor’s office until you have your questions answered.” 
 Enlist a second set of ears. 
 In addition to providing valuable emotional support, bringing a family member or close friend along to appointments can ensure that someone else is there to capture important feedback. As you go through the list of questions with your physician, ask your loved one to listen and take notes. It will be one less thing for you to worry about, and a helpful way for them to understand what you’re experiencing and how they might be able to help. 
 Talk about what’s still ahead. 
 Bladder cancer can be a life-changing diagnosis, and you’re likely wondering what types of changes you’ll be facing in the short and long term. As you talk to your doctor about next steps following diagnosis, make sure to discuss what your hopes are in terms of quality of life. Whether you’re curious about preserving continence, using a catheter or sexual function, having this information will help you to make decisions and adjust to what comes your way. 
 Hear what your community has to say. 
 There’s an entire community of people like you who are eager to share their experiences and advice. Visit the Let’s Target the Tough Stuff YouTube channel at https://bit.ly/2HB9r4F to listen to healthcare professionals and members of the bladder cancer community talk about how people with bladder cancer and their loved ones can work with their care team to tackle difficult conversations together.

 PITTSBURGH — Josh Bell spent some time in the seats above the Clemente Wall in right field at PNC Park on Friday night, carefully folding a handful of gold T-shirts with the phrase “Bellieve” on them over the chairs as part of a promotion that is doubling as an All-Star Game push for the scorching Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman. 
 The 26-year-old stressed, however, that he only laid out a couple of shirts. Three maybe. Four, tops. Team employees handed out the rest. Bell had other things to do pregame, namely sticking to the routine that helped him put together one of the most remarkable months in the franchise’s long history. 
 More Brewers coverage 
 Moustakas homers twice, Brewers beat Pirates 11-5 
 Bell had two of Pittsburgh’s 13 hits — all singles — in Pittsburgh’s 9-4 victory over Milwaukee on Friday night. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. His 94 total bases during the month are the most by any Pirate in any month ever. Heady territory considering Pittsburgh started playing baseball a century — and then some — before Bell was born. 
 “I feel like I’m just riding the wave,” Bell said. 
 One that doesn’t appear close to cresting. 
 Bell’s total base mark broke Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner’s record of 92 set in June, 1947. Bell is also one of only three players in National League history to have 12 home runs and 12 doubles in the same month, joining Hall of Famers Frank Robinson and Hank Aaron. 
 “He pushes himself,” Pittsburgh pitcher Chris Archer (2-5) said of Bell after picking up his first victory since April 7. “If he gets out, he’s mad. He’s hitting .340 and he’s angry that he’s got out, which continues to keep him motivated. He’s not content. We’ve got four months left in the season and I expect to see big things from him going forward.” 
 Bell didn’t provide any big blasts Friday night, but contributed to a flood of small ones as the Pirates jumped on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin to win for just the fourth time in 11 games. Starling Marte had three hits and scored three times and Kevin Newman went 2 for 5 with two RBIs to extend his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games. 
 SHAKY CHACIN 
 Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command abandoned him in the third inning. The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh’s lead to 5-1. Freddy Peralta replaced Chacin and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh’s advantage to 7-1. 
 Chacin — a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series — saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. 
 “I just lost my focus in that inning,” Chacin said. “That never happened to me before, walking guys with the bases loaded like that. I need to start to do a better job if I want to keep pitching.” 
 Something that might not be guaranteed. Asked if Chacin might need a break, Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said only: “We’ve got to figure out how to get him pitching the way he’s capable of.” 
 ARCHER REBOUNDS 
 Archer came in winless since early April, a stretch that’s watched the centerpiece of a deal that sent Tyler Glasnow and Austin Meadows to Tampa Bay search for answers. He seemed to find some in a bullpen session in Cincinnati while throwing to Jacob Stallings. Stallings encouraged Archer to rely more on his fastball, and Archer responded by striking out seven with two walks in seven innings. He gave up a solo home run to Jesus Aguilar in the third and a three-run shot to Keston Hiura in the fourth but settled down afterward. 
 “I’m going to stay relentless,” Archer said. “I’ve been doing this a long time. I’m not going to let (a slump) define me.” 
 TRAINER’S ROOM 
 Brewers: C Manny Pina (right hamstring discomfort) is expected to rejoin Milwaukee over the weekend. 
 Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles (left hamstring discomfort) will start Sunday’s series finale. … RHP Keone Kela will be shut down for 10 days after the right shoulder discomfort that sent him to the injured list popped back up during a rehab assignment. 
 UP NEXT 
 Brewers: Brandon Woodruff (7-1, 3.22 ERA) will look for his seventh straight win on Saturday. Woodruff limited the Phillies to one run in eight innings last Sunday. 
 Pirates: Nick Kingham (1-1, 8.28) hasn’t won a game as a starter since last July, but will get the nod on Saturday.",1

 How Israel’s ‘kingmaker’ could be the man to end Bibi’s reign 
 Avigdor Lieberman was Netanyahu’s loyal lieutenant – but now he has left the PM exposed to the electorate and the courts

 Israeli politics is in meltdown as the country heads towards its second election within six months. The ramifications of such turmoil for the country and the region are huge – but none of this needed to happen. That it has is down to the frantic efforts of Benjamin Netanyahu to stave off three looming corruption charges . 
 The Israeli prime minister’s desire to avoid a criminal trial is why he called an otherwise unnecessary April election in the first place. And it is why, when he failed to assemble a rightwing coalition by Wednesday’s midnight deadline, the man soon to become Israel’s longest-serving prime minister persuaded his malleable Likud parliamentarians to back a bill to dissolve the Knesset – instead of allowing president Reuven Rivlin to entrust another candidate with the task of trying to form a government. 
 The alternative course – trying to form a broader coalition with the opposition party, Kahol Lavan – looked hopeless because its leader, Benny Gantz, had refused to join with a prime minister whom Israel’s attorney-general intends to indict on the three counts of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. (He denies any wrongdoing, labelling the accusations a “witch-hunt”.) 
 By this weekend “King Bibi”, as his most ardent supporters like to call him, had fully expected to preside over a government preparing to pass a bill granting a sitting prime minister immunity from prosecution. It was in return for this that he had, before the election, held out to his ultra-nationalist, would-be coalition partners the seismic prospect of annexing at least parts of the occupied West Bank. And to satisfy them further, he was ready to promote unprecedented curbs on Israel’s supreme court. 
 Unfortunately, Netanyahu reckoned without Avigdor Lieberman. Having emerged as kingmaker, the ambitious Moldova-born former foreign and defence minister, who was once a close lieutenant of Netanyahu, decided not to bring his five Knesset members into what would have then become a right-wing majority government. The sole point at issue was a draft law to end the wholesale exemption of ultra-Orthodox men from military conscription – now likely to be a key issue in the next election. Lieberman refused to compromise on the law with the ultra-Orthodox parties, another crucial element of Netanyahu’s putative rightwing coalition. 
 While Lieberman may pick up new votes beyond his mainly Russian-speaking constituency – both for standing up to Netanyahu and for posturing as the champion of secular Israel – he is, to put it mildly, no liberal. A super-hawk who has demanded the death penalty for terrorists, he called for Arabs living in Israel to lose their citizenship unless they declare formal allegiance to the state. And he resigned from the cabinet last year, protesting Netanyahu’s failure to enact even harsher military measures against Gaza. 
 But his sabotaging of the coalition process has not only severely weakened Netanyahu but also cast fresh doubt on the Trump administration’s faltering plans for a “ deal of the century” to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. After the spectacularly ill-timed visit of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East adviser Jason Greenblatt for talks last week with Netanyahu to bolster this month’s Bahrain conference on economic aspects of the plan, US officials insisted the conference, which the Palestinians boycotted, would go ahead. 
 However, it is still unclear whether or when the administration intends to unveil the political aspects of the plan, which had been delayed to await formation of a stable Israeli government, and was satirised on Thursday as the “deal of the next century” by Palestinian Liberation Organisation negotiator Saeb Erekat. 
 Despite his attempts to make light of it, the collapse of the coalition negotiations is a severe personal blow to Netanyahu. Even if the parliamentary arithmetic had allowed him to form a government without Lieberman, his chances of escaping prosecution have shrunk. 
 The election is fixed for 17 September, just a month before he is due to face a pre-indictment hearing, leaving little or no time to introduce an immunity bill if and when he forms a government with no doubt increasingly reluctant coalition partners. He could also face an internal revolt from impatient Likud rivals. 
 It remains to be seen whether Lieberman again emerges as a kingmaker, but it looks increasingly likely that Netanyahu’s one-time ally will go down in history as the king-breaker.

 NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Taylor Swift says she’s kicking off Pride Month by asking Tennessee’s Republican U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander to protect LGBTQ rights and support the Equality Act. 
 The pop star, who lives in Tennessee, posted a letter on social media early Saturday that she supported the House’s recent passage of the Equality Act, which would extend civil rights protections to LGBT people by prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The protections would extend to employment, housing, loan applications, education, public accommodations and other areas. 
 The Democratic-controlled House in mid-May passed the legislation. Every Democrat voted in favor, along with eight Republicans. However, in the GOP-controlled Senate, the bill’s chances appear slim. 
 Swift added that she “personally rejects” the notion that President Donald Trump’s administration supports equal treatment of all people.

 VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) — The gunman who killed 12 people in a Virginia Beach municipal building was identified by police Saturday as a 15-year city employee who had served in the military and was described by neighbors as quiet and rarely smiling. 
 Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera identified the gunman as DeWayne Craddock, who was employed as an engineer with the city's public utilities department. Cervera declined to comment on a motive for Friday's rampage that ended with Craddock dying in a gun battle with police. . 
 Authorities used a Saturday morning news conference to focus on the victims, saying 11 of them worked for the city. Another victim was a contractor trying to get a permit. They projected photos on a screen and gave each victim's name along with biographical details. 
 ""They leave a void that we will never be able to fill,"" said City Manager Dave Hansen. 
 Hansen said that chaplains and family assistance workers worked overnight to notify family members of the dead, which he described as ""the most difficult task anyone will ever have to do."" 
 The 11 city employees who died were identified as Laquita C. Brown of Chesapeake, Tara Welch Gallagher of Virginia Beach, Mary Louise Gayle of Virginia Beach, Alexander Mikhail Gusev of Virginia Beach, Katherine A. Nixon of Virginia Beach, Richard H. Nettleton of Norfolk, Christopher Kelly Rapp of Powhatan, Ryan Keith Cox of Virginia Beach, Joshua A. Hardy of Virginia Beach, Michelle ""Missy"" Langer of Virginia Beach and Robert ""Bobby"" Williams of Chesapeake. The 12th victim, Herbert ""Bert"" Snelling of Virginia Beach, was a contractor filling a permit. 
 Authorities have said the gunman opened fire with a handgun in the municipal building Friday afternoon, killing 12 people on three floors and sending terrified co-workers scrambling for cover before police shot and killed him following a ""long gun battle."" Four other people were wounded in Friday's shooting, including a police officer whose bulletproof vest saved his life, police have said. 
 Police have said the suspect was armed with a .45-caliber handgun. Cervera said Saturday that more weapons were found at the scene and at his home, but declined to elaborate. 
 Craddock, 40, was a professional engineer who had graduated from Denbigh High School in nearby Newport News in 1996 and joined the Army National Guard, according to a newspaper clip from the time. He received basic military training and advanced individual training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He later graduated from Old Dominion University with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. Before going to work in Virginia Beach, he worked for a private engineering firm in Hampton Roads. 
 Craddock appears to have had no felony record, which would have made him eligible to purchase firearms. 
 People who live near Craddock said police swarmed the small neighborhood of modest townhomes in Virginia Beach on Friday where some said he had lived for at least 10 years. 
 Several neighbors said Craddock was clean cut, a member of the neighborhood association board and spent time lots of time at the gym. But they also said he mostly kept to himself, especially after his wife left him some number of years ago. 
 Angela Scarborough, who lives in the neighborhood, said ""he was very quiet . he would just wave."" 
 She said she knew his wife, but she left some time ago. ""She just left,"" Scarborough said. ""Didn't let us know or anything."" 
 ""I'm very saddened because this is a great neighborhood,"" Scarborough said. ""It's very sad to know that that's the way he decided to resolve the situation. It's just something I can't believe."" 
 She added: ""I would speak to him and he would speak back, but conversation-wise, I never had a conversation with him."" 
 Cassetty Howerin, 23, who lived under Craddock, was visibly shaken upon learning from reporters that police said he was behind the shooting. 
 ""That could have easily been me,"" she said. 
 Howerin said Craddock had cameras at his home monitoring two nice cars parked out front, including what appeared to be a Mustang. But she said she never saw him bring anyone over. She never saw him come home with groceries. 
 ""He never really cracked a smile,"" she said. 
 She said he seemed to be up at all hours of the night, walking around his apartment and sometimes dropping heavy things on the floor above her apartment. She also said that he was ""jacked"" from spending a lot of time at the gym.

 Wars happen when diplomacy fails. But only in North Korea perhaps can an unsuccessful diplomat find himself facing the business end of a firing squad. That at least is the reported fate of 'special' envoy Kim Hyok-chol and other more junior foreign office officials from Pyongyang. They had been involved in high-level preparations for February's nuclear summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, where their boss, the roly-poly tyrant Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump met to try to resolve the issue of nuclear proliferation on the Korean peninsula.

36769,"New Allentown Diocese priest first became a father long before his ordination Saturday 
 | The Morning Call | 
 Jun 01, 2019 | 2:06 PM 
 The Allentown Catholic Diocese ordained three priests on Saturday morning at the Cathedral of Catharine of Siena. John Maria is pictured at center, with Zachary Wehr (left) and Giuseppe Esposito. (Sharon Merkel/Special to The Morning Call) 
 At seminary, the young guys hit him with all the old man jokes. John Maria laughed along. 
 After all, the Berks County man knew he was like a grizzled veteran catcher walking into a clubhouse full of rookies. Older, even. He was in his mid-40s when he began his five-year training for the Catholic priesthood. 
 Advertisement 
 But the metaphor ends there. The catcher is at the end of his vocation. Maria, now 51, ordained in the Diocese of Allentown on Saturday, is at the beginning of his. 
 “We’re ready to get to work,” he said in a recent interview, looking forward to the solemn and nerve-wracking moment when Allentown Bishop Alfred A. Schlert would lay hands on him and two other ordinands and confer the priesthood. 
 For many men who pursue that vocation, discernment begins early ― age 16 on average, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, a Catholic think tank in Washington, D.C. The group, called CARA, recently released the results of a survey of nearly 400 men on track for ordination this year. 
 Maria, of Sinking Spring, can be counted among the oldest men ordained in Allentown. Diocese communications director Matt Kerr said two older men were ordained in the past few decades. One was 57, another 54. 
 Maria is about 18 years older than the average 2019 ordinand, according to the CARA report. Since 1999, that average has been in the mid-thirties and trending younger — from 36 in 1999 to the current average of 33. The men ordained with Maria — the Rev. Giuseppe Esposito, 37, and the Rev. Zachary Wehr, 28 ― are more typical of a seminary class. 
 Maria, raised by devout Catholic parents in the Luzerne County borough of Pittston, might have had an earlier calling, but underwent the not-uncommon experience of falling away from his faith as he grew. By the time he reached college, he was Catholic only in name. 
 That was at Penn State, where he met Amy Heffner — the woman who, in senior year, became his wife. They had a son, James, but their union fared poorly. 
 “We had high hopes, but weren’t really prepared for the challenge of marriage,” Maria said. “I never imagined being divorced, but we were divorced in 1990.” 
 It was a crucial year, as his dormant faith began stirring. 
 “That was a pivotal time for me to decide whether this faith I grew up with was a family tradition or a way to Christ and hope and happiness,” he said.

 Embarking on a career in information technology — he joined a small company in Allentown in 1992 — Maria focused on helping to raise his son and began attending daily Mass at the Cathedral of St. Catharine of Siena, the mother church of the diocese.

 “The youngest guy at daily Mass,” he quipped. 
 Entering the priesthood didn’t occur to him. He was divorced, for one thing, and hadn’t pursued an annulment — the church’s declaration that, for some reason, a marriage was never valid. Those reasons can include the immaturity of the couple and their failure to understand the nature and demands of the sacrament. 
 He absolutely has a gift.

 Maria shared custody of James with Heffner. Both took him to church, Maria at the Allentown cathedral and Heffner at a Pentecostal evangelical church.

I always had an eye on working for church. Around 2013, while I considered making a move vocationally, we were approached by a larger company interested in buying us out. That was unforeseen and I took it as a great sign from above.” 
 The new bosses offered him an opportunity to stay with the company. He declined.

 Should Muslim ‘TV warriors’ participate in ‘news channel debates’? 
 Category: India , Top Stories Posted by Sameer Published: Jun 01, 2019, 10:31 am IST Updated: Jun 01, 2019, 10:31 am IST 
 Courtesy ""Muslim Mirror"" 
 New Delhi: Well-known journalist and the former press adviser to the former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, Pankaj Pachuri said the Indian media particularly electronic media has “divorced” journalism. And in the just concluded general elections, it has been once again proved that the media especially the TV channels have been unofficial spokespersons of the ruling party particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his right hand Amit Shah. 
 So, at last, some opposition political parties lost their patience and decided to boycott these so-called news channels which have “divorced” journalism and brazenly become mouth-piece of the ruling party. Calling it ‘enough is enough’, first Samajwadi Party and then the largest opposition Congress party also announced that its spokesperson won’t take party any TV discussion. This decision has also sparked a debate in the Muslim circles and they want that those Muslim persons who are regular feature in the lopsided and TV debates must also follow the suit in the interest of the community. They are of the firm view that TV debates are designed to promote the ideology of hate in the country and these so-called Muslim debaters are strengthening hands of communal forces as the elections results proved this point. 
 In this context, the SP’s decision to not send its spokespersons to participate in news channel debate is being seen as the right decision by many. Following this, Congress media department in-charge Randeep Surjewala announced that the party’s spokespersons will not take part in TV debates for a month. He also requested the TV channels not to invite the party’s spokespersons. 
 This development has triggered a debate among Muslim intellectuals and activists as the community has been a ‘whipping boy’ in such TV debates with a sole intention of polarizing the Indian society on the communal ground to benefit a certain political party. Now, the community wants that ‘Muslim’ debater should also boycott these TV debates. 
 In fact, 24x7x360 Hindu-Muslim debate on news channels have cornered the whole Muslim community and many so-called ‘ Islamic Scholars’ are being used as pawns in their game of divisive agenda. Those so-called ‘Islamic scholars’ with a horrible look without knowledge of the subject kept participating in many news channels whose owners proximity with RSS and BJP no ore a secret. Most of them shout like dogs, are short-tempered and ready to misbehave with women or thrash their opponent. 
 One certified ‘Islamic scholar’ even lost his temper and slapped a woman participant during a well-planned and scripted show. In spite of the fact that the same ‘clergy’ was advised by Deoband Islamic seminary not to participate in TV debates but that advice fell on his deaf ears. The so-called media warriors have stooped to such a low that they even participated in many debates which have nothing to do with Muslims. 
 It is a well-known fact that most of the TV channels pay Rs 2,000-5,000 INR to each participant. No doubt money is a big attraction for these so-called Muslim TV warriors but they have been inflicting irreparable damage to the community by their mental bankruptcy. The Indian society was never divided in such a way even after the horrific events such as demolition of Babri Masjid or Mumbai bomb blasts. 
 ‘By participating in air-conditioned studio discussion, they (Muslim TV warriors) wittingly or unwittingly help in promoting the agenda of RSS and BJP. How and why? As the TV channels always call half-baked Maulvis. Who don’t have a glib tongue and good knowledge of the subject. They don’t go prepared. Perhaps they don’t even ask about the topic of the debate to prepare themselves accordingly. Several times it has surfaced that they were invited for something else and when you go there you find the topic changed, said Nasim Akhtar, ex-professor King Abdul Aziz University, Jeddah. 
 Recently it happened with the noted activist Yogendra Yadav on a channel. He quit the panel immediately. But our so-called Maulvis have no such guts to leave the show. The panelists and the anchors alike are all hounding dogs. They just want to shove their point of view down your throat. Neither would they listen to you not will they allow you to speak,.Why don’t they call Swami Lakshmi Shankaracharya to learn about Islam they want to know? They know it quite well that he will fix them up in a minute. And their agenda will be exposed. These TV debates are hardly conclusive. They leave viewers utterly confused. It’s done so purposely. The moment anyone gets to the thread giving the discussions a logical shape, he is interrupted vehemently so much so that the thread lost, he added. 
 ‘Of course, they should not participate in TV debates as they have been playing into the hands of TV Channels which have well-designed agenda of hate, said Amir Eidrisi, the president of Association of Muslim professional. 
 While Prof. P. Koya the former editor of Thejas has a different view. ‘Personally, I don’t accept their invitation as I have the feeling that they are trying to send the message of objectivity. But we can’t tell every Muslim to keep away as many like the free publicity and sometimes it will function as a tool to present our views’ said Koya. 
 ‘Those Muslim debaters should keep away from the media as they are using Muslims as a tool to antagonize and polarize people. This is the trap game we should be aware of it. We should respect our ideas and Muslim dignity. Then they will realize not to exploit us. Our ideas and brains are not for sale. Muslims should learn to respect themselves, said US-based psychiatric Dr.M Khutubuddin. 
 ‘Absolutely, the novice and self-proclaimed Muslim leaders/representative should stop appearing in “TV debates” to increase TRP thereby polarizing the communal harmony’ said Er. Tanveer Alam, a Kolkata based activist-journalist. 
 ‘These TV channels are sold out. They are not impartial. The moment a Muslim intellectual or political activist will open his mouth with a sensible point of argument, they will let lose upon you barking and attacking hound in the form of a news anchor and he would keep bragging you and may, tear your throat if you continue or until you digress to submissive discourse. Media houses are no more the fourth estate, they have become the strongest pillar of the new fascism in India – the most corrupt face of India- socio polity, said S.M. Sarwar Hussain, ex-president of AMU Students Union. 
 Rather than boycotting them we should learn how to defeat them, this is the solution presented by Mumbai based journalist Dr. Saleem Khan .’ They shouldn’t boycott but learn to defeat them. Our case is strong but the presentation is weak. Need improvement in that area’ said Dr. Khan. 
 The knowledge and wisdom of these Muslim debaters have always been questionable. ‘They only allow those debaters who have half-knowledge, short-tempered and will not answer wisely and should look stereotypical. But they will not boycott, because of their love for fame and easy money, said Pune based physician Dr S H Khan. 
 Muslim community should ideally boycott completely any person who goes as representative on any ‘sold’ media debate from now on, he added. 
 Advocate Sharfuddin who is frequently seen on different channels have got some strange experience, although he is invited by different channels on a daily basis but generally he refuses politely to them. But sometimes when he thinks the topic is v important and he should present his viewpoints then he joins the debate. 
 ‘My personal experience is though inviting us at debate apparently seems to be innocuous yet often premeditated to infer a negative conclusion against Muslims with a view to widening the communal and sectarian gulf. In most of the TV shows where self-claimed and falsely-prospected Muslim representatives without commanding knowledge at issue of debate do more harm by their mere participation and in a way render authenticity to debate purposely organized on fake issues deliberately projected to distract public attention from the real issues. Participation may only be with deep preparedness on the debating subject, said Adv. Sharfuddin. 
 ‘The so-called Maulanas should desist from going to TV debates, they end up miserably defeated and rejected. They do not understand the nuances of an issue. Even on religious matters which are very complex the semi-educated of mostly fake Maulanas end up making the community a laughing stock as they lack serious scholarship on the issue. 
 However, Kolkata based advocate Sadaf Parveen is dead against the participation of fake Muslim scholars in TV debates, who are doing irreparable damage to the image of the community. ‘Such debaters must be stopped at any cost’ she said.

 Must-Reads Of The Week From Brianna Labuskes

 The Friday Breeze 
 Newsletter editor Brianna Labuskes, who reads everything on health care to compile our daily Morning Briefing, offers the best and most provocative stories for the weekend. 
 Happy Friday! I come bearing a medical ethical quandary for you to mull as you head into your weekend. Stumped mid-surgery, a renowned doctor turned to old anatomical drawings that had been created by Nazis (and are, to this day, considered unsurpassed in comprehensiveness and precision). She was left with the question: Were they OK to use ? 
 Now on to what you may have missed this week. 
 If you thought the topic of abortion was going anywhere anytime soon, you’d be very wrong! (Although, let’s be honest, were any of us expecting an end to the debate?) In terms of health care, it dominated this week’s news cycle. 
 Let’s start with 2020 hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris’ plan to protect abortion rights. Borrowing logic from the Voting Rights Act, the plan from Harris (D-Calif.) would require states with a history of unconstitutionally restricting abortion rights to obtain federal approval from the Department of Justice before such laws could take effect. Where it gets tricky is determining which states would fall under the requirements: the formula used in the VRA was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2013 . 
 The New York Times: Kamala Harris Wants to Require States to Clear Abortion Laws With Justice Dept. 
 Meanwhile, the Supreme Court performed a delicate dance on a tightrope when it ruled on an Indiana abortion ban. The justices upheld parts of the law, which dictate that fetal remains need to be buried or cremated, but they went ahead and sidestepped ruling on the constitutionality of the right to an abortion. The move signals that they might not be super eager to move aggressively on the issue, despite the way states keep trying to send them cases. 
 The New York Times: Supreme Court Sidesteps Abortion Question in Ruling on Indiana Law 
 Speaking of … Louisiana’s Democratic governor broke with his party this week to sign “heartbeat” legislation. Though it wasn’t a surprise (Gov. John Bel Edwards has been vocal about his support of the bill), it’s notable in a political landscape where many are left wondering if there’s any room left in the Democratic Party for anti-abortion politicians. 
 The Associated Press: Louisiana’s Democratic Governor Signs Abortion Ban Into Law 
 Although many people do have their eyes on the cases that are designed to challenge Roe v. Wade, an argument can be made that abortion opponents have already won the ground game. Even if Roe is upheld, opponents have taken enough bites of the apple over the past several years that the landscape looks a lot different than it once did. Considering mandatory waiting periods, clinic deserts, the missed wages and work that comes with traveling to get the procedure done, and the hostility that doctors and clinic staff face from protesters, for a lot of women — low-income women, especially —getting an abortion is already a monumental task.

 As President Donald Trump prepares an executive order geared toward increasing transparency across the health industry, some parties are making such a ruckus over a particular element that it might get dropped in the final version. At issue is a requirement that insurers and hospitals disclose for the first time the discounted rates they negotiate for services. “There is good transparency and bad transparency,” Kristine Grow, spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, told The Washington Post. “This is bad transparency, because it is highly likely to cause prices to go up for everyone.”

 And elsewhere on the unhappy insurers front: Connecticut lawmakers have pressed pause on their push for a public option. The reason? Blowback from insurers. While I’m sure it’s more complicated than I’m making it, I was left wondering if the lawmakers had thought insurers were going to like it.

 HHS is proposing to roll back protections for transgender patients by mandating that “gender identity” is not protected under federal laws that prohibit sex discrimination in health care. A court challenge is almost certain, and patients are unlikely to feel any immediate impact from the proposal. But advocates see it as another move in the administration’s attempts to chip away at transgender rights.

 A major opioid trial kicked off this week in Oklahoma with some fighting words thrown out by state Attorney General Mike Hunter. Hunter accused Johnson & Johnson — which is the sole remaining plaintiff in the case after the other companies settled — of using a “deceitful, multibillion-dollar brainwashing campaign’’ to dupe doctors into prescribing the opioids. The tricky part of the case is that painkillers are regulated and approved medication, and pinning the crisis on one company might be an uphill battle for the attorney general’s office. Still, the eyes of the nation are on the trial as a precursor to larger ones that are coming up.

 How much is a miracle worth? That’s the question on the front burner once again now that the FDA has approved the world’s more expensive drug (with a price tag of over $2 million). Experts say it’s not so much the drug itself that’s the problem, but that it sets a new, higher benchmark for what people will end up paying for lifesaving drugs. Because there are plenty more coming behind it.

 In the miscellaneous file for the week: 
 • Check out this fascinating and terrifying story about a children’s hospital where even low-risk patients were dying after surgeries. Audio obtained by The New York Times gives an unfiltered look at conversations between the doctors, which can boil down to: “Oh, my God … this is beyond horrifying.” 
 The New York Times: Doctors Were Alarmed: ‘Would I Have My Children Have Surgery Here?’ 
 • A Chicago nursing home’s debacle shines a light on the vulnerabilities of a HUD program that has become a linchpin in the nation’s elder care system. It’s a program that most people don’t even realize exists but could be an Achilles’ heel for the government. 
 The New York Times: A Nursing Home Chain’s Collapse Leaves the Government on The Hook 
 • In a world where “Oh no, females are so complicated, so we just don’t study them” is a normal and expected thing to say, some researchers are trying to fight for more representation in clinical trials. But just saying there should be X number of women isn’t enough. Scientists need to go further, some say. 
 The New York Times: Fighting the Gender Stereotypes That Warp Biomedical Research 
 • Why is it Republicans who are gravitating toward the anti-vaccination movement? In the past, the party viewed it as a civic responsibility to get kids vaccinated, while resistance more often came from liberal enclaves. Today, the debate is becoming entangled with the idea of freedom from the government — and is wooing some Republicans. 
 That’s it from me! Have a great weekend.

 By AYA BATRAWY 
 Associated Press 
 MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Saudi Arabia's King Salman slammed Iran over recent attacks targeting the kingdom, describing the incidents on Saturday in a speech before Muslim leaders gathered in Mecca as ""terrorist acts"" that threaten global energy supplies. 
 It was the monarch's strongest words yet since tensions spiked in recent weeks between the two regional heavyweights. 
 Iran had a representative present at the 57-nation summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, or OIC, but its top leadership did not attend. 
 The Islamic summit drew political figures and heads of state from countries spanning Africa, the Middle East and Asia. 
 They come with widely varying policies and priorities, but share a common reverence for the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem, known as the first ""Qibla"" because Muslims prayed toward it before the cube-shaped Kaaba in Mecca. 
 Despite sharp differences between OIC member-states on a gamut of issues, a final statement by the group stressed support for a future Palestinian state, as well as the rejection of any deal or plan that prolongs Israeli occupation and undermines the right of return for Palestinian refugees. 
 The language stood in contradiction to the Trump administration's decision to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in recognition of it as Israel's capital, as well as a still undisclosed White House plan already rejected by the Palestinian leadership. 
 Glimpses of the plan suggest it sidelines or ignores the longstanding goal of Palestinian independence. A meeting next month in Bahrain aimed at rallying Arab economic support for the plan is being boycotted by the Palestinian Authority, but Saudi Arabia and the UAE are attending amid growing ties with Israel in the face of shared enemy Iran. 
 The U.S. recently sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf as tensions run high. The escalation stems from the Trump administration's decision to withdraw the U.S. from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers last year and impose crippling economic sanctions on the country. 
 Speaking to leaders from OIC countries, King Salman opened the summit saying the world must fight the sources and funding of terrorism around the world. 
 He then said the alleged sabotage of four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in past weeks represents a ""grave danger"" to the security of maritime traffic and regional security. 
 He blamed Iranian-backed terrorist militias of being behind a subsequent drone attack on a Saudi oil pipeline. 
 ""We emphasize that these subversive terrorist acts are aimed not only at the kingdom and the Gulf region, but also on the security of navigation and energy supplies to the world,"" King Salman said. 
 Iran denies being involved in the incidents. 
 Iran's President Hassan Rouhani had his own message for OIC leaders ahead of the summit, urging them to stay focused on the rights of Palestinians. 
 In a letter published online Friday, Rouhani said Muslim leaders should not let the importance of Palestinian statehood be ""marginalized"" in the face of the Trump administration's forthcoming Israeli-Palestinian plan. 
 Rouhani also noted in the letter he was not invited to the Islamic summit, but expressed Iran's readiness to work with all Muslim leaders to confront the White House's so-called ""Deal of the Century."" 
 King Salman told OIC leaders that the rights of Palestinians remains the cornerstone issue of the organization, which was formed 50 years ago in response to an extremist arson attack on the Al-Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem, one of Islam's most sacred sites. 
 He said the mosque remains under occupation and threat. 
 ""We reiterate with emphasis the rejection of any measures that infringe upon the legal status of Al-Quds Al-Sharif,"" King Salman said, referring to east Jerusalem and the mosque compound. 
 Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said any peace deal that does not include an independent and sovereign Palestinian state along 1967 borders with east Jerusalem as its capital will be rejected by the OIC body. 
 ""We shall not accept the rewriting of history, exchanging justice with economic benefits and disregarding dignity and legitimacy,"" he told the OIC summit. 
 The meeting began after midnight and ran into the early hours Saturday due to evening prayers and day-long fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. 
 Saudi Arabia's effort to bring leaders to Mecca reflects the kingdom's desire to project a unified Muslim and Arab position on Iran to isolate it internationally. 
 Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said Tehran regrets ""Saudi Arabia's abuse of its privilege as the host"" of the OIC ""to sow division between Islamic and regional countries."" 
 The summit follows two emergency Arab meetings the night before in Mecca criticizing Iran's behavior and influence in countries like Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. 
 Presenting a unified stance on Iran faces obstacles within OIC member-states, which includes Iran. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is attending the summit, has sought good ties with both Saudi Arabia and Iran, for example. 
 The leader of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group told supporters in Lebanon on Friday the Mecca summits are a Saudi call for help from Arab countries after Saudi Arabia failed to win in Yemen, where the kingdom and its allies have been at war since 2015 against Iranian-allied Yemeni rebels. 
 ""It is a sign of failure,"" Hassan Nasrallah said. ""These summits are calls for help ...that express the failure and the inabilities in confronting the Yemeni army, popular resistance and people.""

 CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - For those who hate seeing good things happen to Duke, this U.S. Women's Open is not for you. 
 The school opponents and critics love to root against was dominating again, with former Blue Devil teammates and champions Yu Liu of China and Celine Boutier of France tied for the lead after three rounds. 
 Liu rallied from four shots behind when the round began with a 66 to get to 7 under. Her good friend and fellow starter on the 2014 NCAA championship squad, Boutier, shot a 69. 
 ""I don't know about other people, but when I see Duke players playing well, I kind of want to play well, too,"" Boutier said. 
 There's been plenty of that recently, especially at the Country Club of Charleston. 
 Duke won another NCAA title last week and sophomore Gina Kim, an amateur, has been near the top of the leaderboard much of the tournament. Liu and Boutier kept that going to set up an ultimate Duke-on-Duke showdown for a major title. 
 ""It's a major championship,"" said Liu, 23. ""Everybody is out there trying to win and we'll be very focused."" 
 Liu remembers the 25-year-old Boutier driving her to dinners and generally looking after her younger teammate. They kept their friendship after going pro, spending time at Symetra Tour and LPGA events. 
 They've even played together in a final pairing before, Liu said, at the HSBC Women's World Championships earlier this year. ""I didn't play very well and she didn't play very well, either,"" Liu said. 
 Liu and Boutier were a stroke in front of Lexi Thompson, Jaye Marie Green and Japan's Mamiko Higa, the surprise leader the first two rounds. 
 Boutier held the lead at 8 under until she made her only bogey of the round on No. 16 after stubbing a chip and needing a 21-footer to limit the damage. She won the Vic Open in February in Australia for her first LPGA Tour title. 
 Liu, in her first U.S. Women's Open, made six birdies in a 13-hole stretch to move up after starting four shots off the lead. She's winless on the tour. 
 Thompson powered her way into contention, going eagle-birdie on the 15th and 16th holes for a 68. 
 Green shot 68, her second sub-70 showing this week after entering with just one round in the 60s in five Open appearances. 
 Higa had an up-and-down round of three birdies and three bogeys to lose the lead she's held much of the week. She finished with her second straight 71. 
 Boutier had a 25-foot birdie try on the final hole, but went a foot or so past and finished with par to close a long day on course. 
 Boutier was among 45 players who couldn't finish the second round Friday because of a weather delay and had to return before sun up to complete four holes before turning her focus to the third round. 
 She was a stroke behind Higa at the start and the two were in the final threesome. Higa opened things up early with birdies on the third and fourth holes to take a three-shot lead on Boutier. 
 But Boutier stayed patient - and pounced when her opportunities came. She had a 10-foot birdie on the ninth to tie Higa, then moved ahead with a 12-footer for another birdie on the 13th. 
 Boutier's bobble came one of the holes playing the easiest, the par-4 16th when her approach went over the green and she advanced her third about two feet before sending the next one some 20 feet beyond the flag. Boutier rallied once more with a solid, confident stroke for bogey and hold on to a share of first. 
 The 23-year-old Liu had few expectations playing her first U.S. Women's Open and fell five shots off the lead with a bogey on No. 3. But Liu had six birdies the rest of the way and will play the final group with one of her best friends on tour. 
 ""We probably won't talk much,"" she said with a laugh. 
 Thompson, who tied for fifth in this event last year, looked like she was fading with consecutive bogeys on the 10th and 11th holes to fall five shots behind. She rallied by reaching the par-5 15th in two and making a 30-foot putt for eagle. Her approach on the next hole landed five feet away for a birdie that left her a stroke in back. 
 Thompson has 11 top 10s in majors since her lone victory in the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship, now called the ANA Inspiration. She said staying calm after the back-nine bogeys helped her stay in contention. ""It's tough not to let it get to you, but at a tournament like this, you can't,"" she said. 
 Higa was the tournament's stunning storyline early after shooting a 65 Thursday - the lowest debut ever in the U.S. Women's Open - then notching three birdies in six holes after a two-hour storm delay to keep her lead. 
 But bogeys on the seventh, 10th and 12th holes knocked her back. Higa recovered with a birdie on the 14th and parred home to stay in contention. 
 She said she had a difficult time bouncing back after the opening bogey. ""It wasn't a difficult hole,"" she said through an interpreter. ""So that was a turning point (where) I got bad rhythm."" 
 Jessica Korda was a shot off the lead when the round began, but fell three shots back after a 72. 
 NCAA individual women's champion Maria Fassi of Mexico had a 68 after just making the cut in her first professional tournament. Jennifer Kupcho, the Augusta National Women's Amateur champ, struggled to a 76. This is also her first pro event. 
 The course was far from quiet overnight. Workers removed a large tree between the 18th fairway and 11th green that was struck by lightning during Friday's weather delay. Crews were cutting and grinding late Friday. By the start of play Saturday, only a pile of decorative wood chips remained.

3472,"Police: City worker kills 12 in Virginia Beach; suspect dead 
 Associated Press 
 May 31, 2019 
 VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) — Authorities say a longtime city employee wielding a .45-caliber handgun with a suppressor fatally shot 12 people on three floors of a municipal building in Virginia Beach before police shot him. 
 Four other people were wounded in Friday’s shooting, including a police officer whose bulletproof vest saved his life. 
 Police Chief James Cervera says the suspect engaged in a “long gunbattle” with law enforcement officers. He says officers gave the suspect first aid after he was shot, but he died. 
 Cervera said Friday that he would release the suspect’s name after authorities had contacted his family, but would mention the name only once. 
 He said after that, “he will be forever referred to as the suspect because our focus now is the dignity and respect to the victims in this case and to their families.”

63701,"2 killed, 2 injured in crash on US 287 in Donley County near Clarendon 
  
 Saturday 
 Jun 1, 2019 at 3:09 PM 
 Two people died in a car accident just east of Clarendon Friday afternoon. The Texas Department of Public Safety responded to the scene on US 287 in Donley County around 4:07 p.m. 
 Troopers say a 2016 Honda Odyssey driven by Karen Chan was traveling southeast on US 287 about 200 feet east of Clarendon's city limits. Chan, 37, of Palo Alto, Calif., veered into the northbound lanes, directly into the path of Sandra Gray, who was driving a 2015 Chevrolet Traverse. The head-on collision killed both Chan and Gray, 57, of Amarillo; both were pronounced dead at the scene by Dr. John Howard. 
 Gray's passengers, an 8-year-old girl and 1-year-old boy were taken to Northwest Texas Hospital in Amarillo with non-life-threatening injuries. 
 The road conditions were dry and all parties are said to have been wearing seat belts. The crash remains under investigation by DPS troopers; information may change, be corrected, or added based on the investigators' findings.

 Man continues to live in flooded house 
 June 1, 2019 at 6:36 PM EDT - Updated June 1 at 7:05 PM 
 CLARKSVILLE, Mo. (KHQA/CNN) - Al Boatman moved to Clarksville, Missouri well aware that the town floods. 
 When this year's flooding started in March, he was hopeful. Boatman built a wall around the house and had pumps to fight the water. 
 ""To be honest, I thought I had it made this year,"" he said. 
 His kitchen is now covered with nearly 12 inches of water. 
 Even so, Boatman hasn’t lost his optimism. He still continues to live in his home. 
 ""This isn't bad. It's like camping out,” Boatman said. “I've got my coffee maker upstairs, I've got the internet upstairs and I have to take care of my two cats because my wife would kill me if anything happened to them."" 
 He chooses to not let the water bring him down. 
 ""I have a philosophy of life: You control what you can control and what you can’t control, you let go,"" Boatman explained. 
 Bill Sterne, a member of the emergency management committee in Clarksville, has noticed the same spirit in many others around town. 
 “Oh, the spirit of the town is unreal,” Sterne said. “Almost everyone has found something to be grateful for, even in a bad situation, and that’s what we have to do in this time.” 
 ""It's traumatic, I know but we'll get through it,"" Boatman concluded. 
 Crest predictions in Clarksville recently went down, but the town is still fighting the flood.

59403,"Spotless second round knots Redman with Cabra atop Bayview Place 
 Media Release 
 Doc Redman                     , The Canadian Press 
 Victoria, British Columbia— When Doc Redman arrived at Uplands Golf Club on Friday afternoon, where he carded an opening-round 64 a day prior, his one-stroke lead had vanished. 
 While Redman was taking in the Victoria scenery on Friday morning, Zach Cabra was out in the morning wave at the Bayview Place DCBank Open presented by Times Colonist, picking up where he left off after an opening-round 66, firing a 63 to move himself five-strokes ahead of Redman before he had even taken a tee shot. 
 Redman, though, was not phased by the early game of leapfrog. Already having made birdie on hole Nos. 2 and 4 despite heavier wind conditions, the 21-year old made a statement on hole No. 7, rolling in a 10-footer for eagle to put himself back near the top of the leaderboard. 
 “It’s great to get off to a good start, you can mess up or you can go low at any point, so it was nice to be four under pretty early,” said the Clemson alumnus. “It was playing tough today and it was a lot windier this afternoon and the greens were a lot firmer, too.” 
 While some players fold under difficult conditions, Redman anticipates doing the opposite in his professional career. As evidence by his top-20 finish earlier this month on the game’s biggest stage at the Wells Fargo Championship, Redman thrives when the going gets tough. 
 “The Wells (Fargo Championship) gave me a lot of confidence in my game that I can compete anywhere, especially on a course like that which was really difficult, I play my best when it’s really difficult,” said Redman. “I hope conditions are similar tomorrow, like today, because I love when it’s playing tough.” 
 Making one more birdie on his back nine, Redman signed for a bogey-free 65 and will play in the final pairing on Saturday alongside Cabra. 
 “I don’t know the last time I was in a final pairing, but it’s a blast,” said Redman “I was disappointed not to be able to pull away a bit, but it’s going to be awesome and hopefully there’s lots of people watching.” 
 Trailing Cabra and Redman by three strokes is Victoria native Jimmy Jones, who managed his second-consecutive round of 66 to slot into the third spot on the leaderboard and is currently the favourite to pick up the Canada Life Canadian Player of the Week Award. Jones also happens to be good buddies with Redman. 
 “Late last year I went down and hung out with Jimmy (Jones) in Jacksonville and that was really fun, and likewise, I thought it was awesome he was playing well earlier on today,” said Redman when asked about his friend’s performance. “He deserves it, he got in last minute and he’s a great player. 
 “You want to see your friends do well, but you want to beat them by one stroke.”",1

 Pilot's son frustrated by crash investigation 
 Muncie man remains hospitalized following May 5 accident

 The Piper Seneca PA 34, which crashed May 5 at Anderson Municipal Airport, is owned by SPC Leasing. 
 John P. Cleary | The Herald Bulletin 
 ANDERSON — The son of a Muncie man said he is frustrated by the federal investigation into his father’s plane accident. 
 Spencer Jackson, 69, of Muncie, remains hospitalized following the accident on May 5. 
 He was flying a Piper PA-34 Seneca that crashed shortly after takeoff at the Anderson Municipal Airport, according to a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board. 
 Evan Jackson said his father has been a pilot for more than 41 years and logged thousands of hours of flight. 
 “You would think they would want to know exactly what happened,” said Evan Jackson. “A 40-year pilot doesn’t wreck a plane on takeoff.” 
 The airplane was registered to and operated by SPC Leasing, LLC of Daleville. The registered agent’s name for the Domestic Limited Liability Company is Laura Gruwell. No other information regarding the company’s members is listed on the INBiz website. 
 Witnesses reported seeing the airplane rock back and forth during its initial climb, according to the NTSB. The left wing dropped, the airplane descended, and impacted the ground with the left wing first. 
 Video surveillance at the airport captured the airplane’s departure, but authorities denied a request by The Herald Bulletin to see the video. 
 “A review of the video revealed the airplane's wings rocked slightly before it disappeared out of view,” the preliminary report by the NTSB states. “When the airplane reappeared in the camera's view, the airplane was descending with the left wing low. 
 “The airplane impacted terrain and came to rest facing the opposite direction of travel.” 
 The cockpit area and cabin of the aircraft was “largely destroyed” by the impact, according to the report. 
 Evan Jackson said there are ways to test equipment on the airplane that would provide key information about the crash, but he said those tests have not been performed. 
 “The whole situation is unfortunate and we are just trying to get through it the best we can,” he said.

 Inside Edition 
 After weeks of training, graduation day was finally here. With a pep in his step, Valor padded across the stage to receive his diploma and then posed for photos. 
 But Valor is no ordinary graduate. The 2-year-old Labrador-golden retriever mix is an assistance dog specially trained by the nonprofit Canine Companions for Independence (CCI), and over the past two weeks, he's been getting to know his new handler, Paul Monfre, as they both learn the skills they need to work together. 
 ""It's life-changing for me because he's just amazing,"" the 52-year-old of Long Island, New York, said of Valor. ""He's the best thing that ever happened."" 
 It's been a long road for Valor leading up to graduation. He received his initial training from puppy raisers Jennifer and Tom Newton of Richmond, Virginia, on behalf of CCI, which provides people in need with assistance dogs free of charge. 
 Then, on May 1,or Match Day as it's called by CCI, Valor met Monfre to begin their training together at the organization's facility on Long Island. 
 Monfre needs Valor to help him with everyday chores around the house like picking up things that fall or grabbing items too low to reach. Right now, Monfre doesn't leave home much because he's in too much pain. 
 Part of his pain stems from an injury sustained after he joined the military right out of high school. ""I acquired a good back injury at that time, but I was young."" Monfre said. ""I was 19 [or] 20, so I recovered from that."" 
 After three years in the military, he went to college before going on to become a New York City firefighter. 
 Then, 9/11 happened. 
 ""I was off that day. After seeing it on the news , [I] called the firehouse and we ended up all going in. ... We took buses into Ground Zero,"" Monfre recalled. ""By the time I got there, the second building had already collapsed. 
 ""We were there from 9:30 a.m. until the following morning. [It was] constant search and rescue. We did that every other day for about two weeks [or] three weeks."" 
 The constant work took its toll. That's where Valor comes in. 
 ""Working on 9/11, he has medical issues related to that: some fatigue, difficulty breathing,"" CCI program coordinator Jessica Riess told InsideEdition.com. ""And I think that Valor's really going to help him regain some of that stamina. I feel like this dog is really going to motivate him to get back to where he was before those things."" 
 After Monfre met Valor on Match Day, they immediately began training that included classroom work and lectures, as well as field trips. It's during those two weeks that Monfre learned 40 commands as well as how to care for Valor as they become partners. 
 ""Being able to give a command to get whatever fell is going to be extremely beneficial,"" he said. 
 Training passed quickly. Two weeks after their introduction , Valor laid on the floor next to Monfre at his graduation breakfast. That's where Monfre met the Newtons for the first time as they bid farewell to the dog they had raised from puppyhood. 
 ""We're a little bit sad,"" Jennifer admitted, though she knows it's important for Valor to move on. 
 The graduation was held at the Genesis Center in Medford on Long Island. Friends and family members filled the auditorium as each four-legged graduate was honored on stage one at a time. 
 While Valor will now live with Monfre, CCI retains ownership of the canine and the other dogs in the program throughout their working lives. There are annual recertifications that allow the staff to check in with Valor and make sure there are no problems. 
 ""I'm glad that the two weeks is up,"" Monfre said of his experience. ""I learned a lot, but now I get to spend good quality time with Valor."" 
 Post-graduation will be ""different,"" he noted. ""We've been going to school here, but now, it could be going to the beach, running with him and long walks."" 
 While it will be challenging to be on their own at first, Monfre said he can't wait to venture out into the world with his new best friend. 
 ""I'm looking forward to months, years to come.""

 Two men face federal charges for threatening York County educator over Trump flag video 
 NEWPORT NEWS, Va. – Two men have been indicted for threatening a York County educator, federal court records show. 
 Robert Scott, of Florida, and Daryl Byerly, of Nevada, are both charged in separate indictments with Threat to Injure in Interstate Communication. 
 A video posted on social media in March showed a para-educator at Tabb High school wrapping a student in a Donald Trump flag. The account “Uncle Sam’s Children” posted the video and sparked outrage in conservative media. 
 After the video went viral, the school began receiving threats . On March 3, Scott called the school and left a voicemail saying, “Not only would I get up and cut your f****** throat n*****, but you do that to me, you f****** n*****, and your skull will be crushed on the f****** floor,” court records say. 
 Scott called back a second time about two minutes later, and left another similarly threatening message, according to the indictment. 
 Federal investigators traced the call to Scott. When confronted by FBI agents, Scott said he did not remember making the calls, saying he “often would get drunk, causing him to not remember his actions,” court records say. He did admit that the voicemails sound like him and that it “obviously” must have been him, according to the indictment. 
 The second man, Daryl Byerly, called and left a voicemails at the school on March 2 and March 6, court documents say. “Put your f****** hands on my kids and watch what I do, I don’t beat your black f****** ass, b**** I will murder you,” Byerly said in one of the calls, according to court records. 
 The School Division increased security following the phone calls. When the district  became aware of the video , administrators reiterated that school board policy says that school time and school property should not be used for any political purposes. Policy also says employees are expected to refrain from engaging in any activity that supports or opposes a candidate or political party while on duty, while on school property during school hours or while representing the school division.",1

 MIAMI (AP) — Immigrant advocates say the U.S. government is allowing migrant children at a Florida facility to languish in ""prison-like conditions"" after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border instead of releasing them promptly to family as required by federal rules. 
 A court filing Friday revealed conditions inside the Homestead, Florida, facility that has become the nation's biggest location for detaining immigrant children. A decades-old settlement governing the care of detained immigrant children calls for them to be released to family members, sponsors or other locations within 20 days, but the court filing accuses the government of keeping kids there for months in some cases. 
 The children detained at the facility said they longed to be released to their parents and other relatives in the United States and were allowed limited phone calls to loved ones. Some were also told to heed strict rules or it could prolong their detention or get them deported. 
 ""At Homestead, children are housed in prison-like conditions and unnecessarily incarcerated for up to several months without being determined to be flight risks or a danger to themselves or others,"" said the motion filed by the National Center for Youth Law and other organizations in federal court in Los Angeles. 
 Dozens of volunteer lawyers, interpreters and other legal workers interviewed more than 70 child migrants at Homestead during several visits over the past year. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does not allow news media to speak to children at guided tours of the facility. 
 A Honduran boy described arriving with an aunt at the Mexico border in December. She was deported and he was sent to Homestead, where he told attorneys he had been held for four months. He could speak to his mother in Honduras twice a week while waiting to be placed with another aunt in Virginia. He was punched in the face by a boy at the facility but said he didn't see a doctor or tell his mother, out of fear she would worry more. 
 ""Already it is very hard. We both cry on the phone,"" he told attorneys. ""I have not seen my mom or any family for so long."" 
 The children's allegations come as officials struggle to accommodate increasing numbers of minors illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The Homestead facility, run by a private contractor, houses 2,200 minors and is expanding to add hundreds of beds. 
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment. The private contractor, Comprehensive Health Services, declined comment. 
 Many of the children are fleeing gang and domestic violence and will end up seeking asylum. Most are sent to live with sponsors once they are screened by the U.S. government, usually aunts or uncles or other relatives who are already in the country. 
 The court filing included testimonials from more than a dozen children who had been separated from parents last year before the Trump administration ended a policy that led to more than 2,700 children being taken from families. Others, who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in the past few months, came alone or with relatives such as aunts, uncles, siblings and were also separated and placed in government custody. 
 The Trump administration has long complained about the 1997 settlement, which generally means the government should release children in about 20 days. 
 The names of the children were redacted, but they testified being there for weeks, or months, without knowing when they would be released. A girl told attorneys she and her sister were at the same facility but kept in separate areas and only allowed to see each other once a week. 
 A 14-year-old boy from Honduras said he had problems videoconferencing with the social worker handling his reunification on two separate occasions, as the company began hiring clinicians and case managers to work long-distance. 
 ""Sometimes there are problems with the Internet, and I have to cut my call short or not talk to her at all and return another time,"" he told attorneys. 
 A Guatemalan girl said she didn't speak any Spanish, only her native Maya language of Q'eqchi, when she arrived, and she had troubles understanding her social worker. 
 In the same filings, a federal field specialist for the U.S. government's Office of Refugee Resettlement said the goal is ""safe, timely release"" but there can be delays, for example, when sponsors can't read and write. And when there's no proof of a prior relationship, the sponsor is automatically disqualified, the specialist said, adding ""the bottom line is always safety."" 
 In several occasions, children were flown from Florida to Texas locations promising they would be reunited with a parent, only to be flown back and booked again into the facility. 
 A Guatemalan child expressed willingness to leave the U.S. voluntarily only to be told that a legal department would need to get involved. 
 ""It is hard for me to understand what is preventing me from joining my family,"" the child said. 
 A Salvadoran boy who said he left his country in January fleeing violence said children at the facility can't touch anyone or fight or they could get a report that will delay their case. He told lawyers that staff told them they would be deported if they tried to escape. He said he couldn't speak with his parents on his 17th birthday since he had already used one of his twice weekly 10-minute phone calls the day before. 
 ""I miss them, and even though today is my birthday, it is hard because they can't call me and I can't call them,"" he said.

 DES MOINES – Take one look at the season-long Charles Schwab Cup points race on the PGA Tour Champions, and most of the names at the top will be familiar to moderately regular golf fans. 
 Even Ken Tanigawa, the No. 2 man in the standings, is top-of-mind following his Senior PGA Championship victory just last week. 
 And then there’s Scott Parel. 
 He won twice last season. He’s sixth on that money list this year, with more than $610,000 to his name. 
 Be honest, though … do you know his name? 
 It’s no knock on anybody, but the 54-year-old has probably slipped under your radar. 
 “I’ve got no problem with nobody knowing who I am,” Parel said. 
 Well, Mr. Nobody is now Capt. Somebody, after his bogey-free first-round 63 Friday at Wakonda Club has him leading the pack at the Principal Charity Classic. 
 Parel is two shots clear at 9-under over a resurgent Chris DiMarco, who carded his best score ever on the Champions Tour by three strokes with a 65. Billy Andrade sits third following a 6-under 66. 
 “This tour is called the PGA Tour Champions for a reason. I mean, most of the guys on this tour were champions on the PGA Tour,” said Parel, who started on the back nine before birdieing four of his final five holes to surge in front. “I’m just fortunate enough that they allow a few guys that show that they can play when they’re over 50 to be able to play with these guys. 
 “… As long as I play good golf, that’s all I care about.” 
 Parel has good reason to feel fortunate. He didn’t turn pro until he was in his 30s. He made just five starts on the PGA Tour and only cracked the cut line once. He played in 222 events on the secondary pro circuit, the Web.com Tour, and earned just a single victory. 
 So, after finishing as the runner-up here last year, he leaped right back into the discussion by equaling the course record set by Andrade in 2016. Kirk Triplett once shot a 62 at Glen Oaks Country Club (also 9-under) for the overall tournament single-round standard. 
 Everybody deserves to be a somebody sometimes. And now could be Parel’s time. 
 “I’m very comfortable out here, as comfortable as you can get in golf in general,” said Parel, who needed just 23 putts Friday, three fewer than anyone else in the field. “But I like where my game’s at.” 
 Much of the field was feeling comfortable, as 45 of the 78 players broke par on a squishy day on the south Des Moines course. The overflowing rain gauges this spring have left the William Langford layout still damp underfoot, even after two precipitation-free days. Players were allowed to lift, clean and place the ball when they were in the fairways. 
 Under those conditions and hitting approaches into soft greens, you’ll either hit paydirt or have the dirt kicked in your face. 
 “The course was there for a score,” said Darren Clarke, who was one of seven golfers to card a 5-under 67 and share fourth place. “There was nothing tricky. You had to drive in the fairway. If you drove it in the fairway, you had chances. 
 “That’s the way it should be.” 
 That’s not the way it has been for DiMarco, a three-time PGA Tour winner and a three-time runner-up in major championships who quit professional golf for almost five years in his late 40s to spend more time with his family. 
 Once he turned 50, he wanted to rededicate himself to the game. But a slew of poor finishes left him in search of confidence. 
 That aha moment arrived at last in central Iowa. He made six birdies on his final seven holes, including a 60-foot bomb on the par-3 17th that sent some mildly rowdy Day 1 crowds roaring on a low part of the course. 
 “The hardest part was getting my competitive edge back and feeling like you belong,” a refreshingly honest DiMarco said after his round. “Do I belong out here? Yes. Do I deserve to be out here? Yes. Do I feel like I can compete out here?” 
 He then paused for a moment before finishing. “And you know, it’s been a struggle.” 
 It had been 15 rounds since he’d broken par. He finished 22-over in just two rounds last week at the Senior PGA. He had nine birdies on Friday; DiMarco said there would be entire tournaments where he wouldn’t have as many circles on his scorecard. 
 There was some extra meaning, then, behind a first-round fist-pump after he coaxed in an 8-foot birdie putt on the short par-4 18th. 
 “There’s not much pressure everywhere else. It’s inner pressure, the battle within myself,” DiMarco said. “I kind of had to push the old me away and say, ‘Get out of here, let’s get this guy back in.’ It was really good for today, for sure.” 
 It will have to be really good the rest of the weekend for anybody to catch that nobody-turned-somebody, though. The friendly conditions expect to stick around through Sunday. 
 And Parel sure isn’t going anywhere. 
 “On this tour, you always have to stay aggressive, anyway. I don’t care where we are or what the conditions are,” he said. 
 “Pars generally don’t work out here too often.”

 Sources say DNA samples taken from Jennifer Dulos’ estranged husband

 Back to Gallery 
 NEW CANAAN — Police have obtained DNA samples from Fotis Dulos, the estranged husband of Jennifer Dulos, a mother of five who has been missing for more than a week, sources told the Hartford Courant . 
 The Courant said investigators suspended a search at Farmington properties associated with Fotis Dulos, including his home on Jefferson Crossing, for the day and are expected to resume the search on Sunday. 
 Fotis Dulos was detained and questioned by police Friday night, a story from the Daily Mail said. Police returned to his home with a search warrant, the Hartford Courant reported .

 Jennifer Dulos prayer vigil draws hundreds in New Canaan 
 The media has been kept out of the private Jefferson Crossing in Farmington, where Fotis Dulos’ residence is located. A Hearst Connecticut Media reporter was turned away by two police officers when he tried to approach the home. 
 Shortly after 2 p.m. Saturday, New Canaan Police Lt. Jason Ferraro issued a release indicating no arrests had been made, and that law enforcement would not comment on who they had questioned. 
 “The criminal investigation into this case is continuing and it does involve securing search warrants. No comment at this time will be offered on details relating to locations of search warrants or details of what items are listed on the search warrants,” Ferraro said. 
 Fotis Dulos and his girlfriend, Michelle Traconis, were seen outside his Farmington home around 6 p.m. Friday speaking with authorities , according to the Daily Mail. Authorities then entered the remained and remained inside for about an hour, the Daily Mail reported. 
 The couple left in their own car and was followed by police, according to the Daily Mail. 
 The Courant reported the Dulos was taken to Troop L in Litchfield Friday night after police showed up at his Jefferson Crossing home in Farmington. Detectives had a search warrant seeking DNA and hair samples, sources told the Courant. After providing the samples, the sources said, Dulos was allowed to leave and wasn’t detained or questioned at the Troop L barracks. 
 Shortly before police arrived at Fotis Dulos’ home, authorities were seen searching for the first time in nearby Hartford. Some two dozen state troopers and firefighters searched the Upper Albany section of the city, first focusing on a storm drain outside of Scotts’ Jamaican Bakery. However, Hartford Deputy Fire Chief Harry Tulier told the Hartford Courant no evidence was found . 
 The Courant reported that investigators obtained surveillance footage of Dulos in a Hartford neighborhood where police did their extensive search for evidence Friday. 
 Search teams checked nearby backyards and looking in trash bins, which residents told state troopers were empty because the garbage had been picked up earlier in the day, the Courant reported. 
 Fotis Dulos, 51, declined to speak to Hearst Connecticut Media when a reporter knocked on his door Friday afternoon . 
 His estranged wife, Jennifer Dulos, 50, was last seen dropping off their five children at New Canaan Country School on May 24. Her SUV was recovered on Lapham Road near Waveny Park after she was reported missing later that night. 
 A source close to the investigation told Hearst Connecticut Media that investigators found blood in Dulos’ home last Saturday . 
 In an effort to find someone who may have witnessed something when Jennifer Dulos’ SUV was parked on the side of the road, police stopped motorists Friday morning on Lapham Road and handed out missing person flyers. 
 A statement from family and friends of Jennifer Dulos released Friday said they remain “hopeful” she will return home safely. 
 “We miss her beyond measure — her five young children, her family, her friends, colleagues, and neighbors, as well as countless people who have never met her but who have responded to the spirit of grace and kindness that Jennifer embodies,” the statement reads. 
 Dulos has been involved in a two-year divorce case with Fotis Dulos. In court documents, she said she was afraid of her estranged husband and was fearful he would retaliate against her for seeking a divorce. 
 Jennifer Dulos’ mother, Gloria Farber, has been in her own legal battle with Fotis Dulos. Farber and her late husband’s estate have filed a lawsuit against Fotis Dulos , accusing him of failing to repay $1.7 million in loans he used to purchase properties and build homes for his business, The Fore Group . 
 When reached by phone on Friday, Gloria Farber declined to comment. 
 On Thursday, police searched a property on Mallard Lake Road in Pound Ridge, N.Y., which records show is owned by Jennifer Dulos’ late father Hilliard Farber. The home is about a 15-minute drive from Dulos’ New Canaan residence. 
 Ferraro said Friday morning the search of the Pound Ridge property had been concluded. 
 Two years ago, Jennifer Dulos abruptly left the Farmington home with her children and moved to New Canaan before filing for divorce the next day. Her sudden departure prompted Fotis Dulos to call 911, saying he was “worried about my wife and kids,” according to audio of the more than four-minute call obtained by the Hartford Courant . 
 The 911 call is referenced in the nearly 500 pages of divorce records. The records also mention how Fotis Dulos initially believed his wife left with the children for her parents’ home in Pound Ridge. 
 As part of the divorce proceedings, Jennifer Dulos filed for an emergency order for full custody that was denied in July 2017. While the divorce is still in litigation, Jennifer Dulos was awarded sole physical custody of the children, who range in age from 8 to 13, after a judge last year found Fotis Dulos to be an unhealthy influence on the children. 
 A status hearing in the divorce case that was scheduled for Wednesday at the Stamford courthouse was postponed. On Tuesday, a court-appointed guardian ad litem filed a motion for a hearing “regarding the safety of the children.” A date has not been set for the conference. 
 Fotis Dulos requested on Wednesday for a judge to allow him to see his children. 
 A motion filed by his attorney, Michael J. Rose, said the children have been staying at Farber’s New York City apartment under the watch of an armed guard the family hired . Fotis Dulos was turned away by the guard when he tried to visit his children Wednesday night, a police source told the New York Post. 
 Late Friday, Fotis Dulos’ divorce attorney filed “withdrawal of deposition notices and production requests.” The notice was scheduled for Jennifer Dulos to be deposed on June 10, court records show.

 Clippers hit with tampering fine for Doc Rivers’s comments about Kawhi Leonard 
 NEW YORK 
 Doc Rivers looks on during a game against the Golden State Warriors at Staples Center on April 18, 2019 in Los Angeles. 
 Harry how/Getty Images 
 The NBA has fined the Los Angeles Clippers US$50,000 for violating the league’s anti-tampering rule after head coach Doc Rivers made comments about Toronto Raptors forward Kawhi Leonard on a recent television appearance. 
 The league did not specify the actual comments, but Rivers recently compared Leonard to Hall of Famer Michael Jordan on an ESPN panel show. 
 “He’s the most like Jordan that we’ve seen,” Rivers said. “Not that he is Jordan or anything like that, but he’s the most like him. Big hands, post-game, can finish, great leaper, great defender, in between game.” 
 Story continues below advertisement 
 Teams can be fined for tampering when a member of that organization expresses interest, either directly or indirectly, in the services of someone under contract with another team. 
 The Clippers have made no secret of their desire to entice Leonard, a Los Angeles native, to sign when he becomes a free agent after this season. 
 The fine was handed down one day after the Raptors opened the NBA Finals with a 118-109 win over the Golden State Warriors in Toronto.

 Louisiana lawmakers add new regulations for abortion clinics

 ORDER REPRINT → 
 Planned Parenthood protesters hold a ""stand-in"" at the Louisiana Capitol, in opposition to legislative passage of a bill that would ban abortion as early as six weeks of pregnancy, on Thursday, May 30, 2019, in Baton Rouge, La. Melinda Deslatte AP Photo 
 BATON ROUGE, La. 
 After passing one of the nation's strictest abortion bans, Louisiana lawmakers also have passed new abortion clinic regulations that critics said would create additional hurdles to access. 
 One measure will lengthen the time that clinics must retain patient records, with detailed requirements and hefty penalties for violations. The other will require women seeking an abortion to receive lengthy background information about the doctor who will perform the procedure. 
 Both bills were sent to Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat expected to sign them into law. 
 Louisiana lawmakers work to steadily erode abortion rights every year in the conservative, religious state where new restrictions regularly are supported by Republicans and Democrats.

 The majority-Republican Legislature on Wednesday gave final passage to a measure that bans abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks of pregnancy. Edwards quickly signed the bill Thursday, making Louisiana the fifth state to enact such a prohibition — though Louisiana's law only takes effect if Mississippi's similar law is upheld by a federal appeals court. 
 Additional legislation by Republican Rep. Raymond Crews, of Bossier City, that won final passage from state lawmakers Thursday boosts the records retention requirements of abortion clinics. The facilities will have to keep records of the procedure for seven years when the woman is 18 or older — and until a woman is 28 years old, if she was younger than 18 when she got an abortion. The records must be kept for 30 years if any child abuse was reported. 
 Violators of the records retention provisions could face large civil fines and license suspension or revocation. 
 During committee testimony on the bill, Crews and Attorney General Jeff Landry's office said the longer retention period would help combat human trafficking by having records available to investigators. Elizabeth Murrill, a lawyer with Landry's office, accused abortion clinics of destroying records and trying to obstruct sexual assault investigations. 
 ""What we have is a record of at least two clinics in Louisiana shredding medical records,"" Murrill said. 
 Linda Hawkins, with the League of Women Voters of Louisiana, called that claim ""bogus."" She said the bill sought to stoke fear in women seeking an abortion and their doctors. 
 ""The underlying nature of the bill is to curtail and limit access to health care,"" Hawkins said. ""This bill is not a human trafficking bill."" 
 A second measure by Republican Sen. Beth Mizell, of Franklinton, will require women seeking an abortion to get written information that includes details about the physician's board certifications, malpractice insurance and any disciplinary actions against the doctor. That bill received final passage Friday. 
 Mizell said the new requirements will help protect women's health. Opponents during committee debate said the bill seeks to provoke fear in women seeking an abortion by giving them lengthy, confusing information that might make them worried about the safety of a legal health care procedure.

 Trump turbulence lags momentum for North American trade deal

 WASHINGTON (AP) — The momentum that supporters have tried to build for a new North American trade deal has run into some Trump turbulence. 
 The Trump administration had taken steps in recent weeks to work with Democratic and Republican lawmakers to address concerns about the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada agreement. 
 Then President Donald Trump made his threat this past week of a 5% tariff on Mexican imports unless America's southern neighbor cracked down on Central American migrants trying to cross the U.S. border. 
 His recent decision to remove U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico had appeased mostly Republicans who were using their trade vote as leverage to do away with those penalties. 
 The administration also had committed to meeting with a group of House Democrats to allay their concerns. That gesture created good will, and as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., described it, put Democrats ""on a path to yes."" 
 Now it's unclear where that path may lead. 
 Influential business groups fear that Trump's threat against Mexico could derail the proposed trade agreement. 
 ""The last thing we want to do is put that landmark deal — and the 2 million manufacturing jobs that depend on North American trade — in jeopardy,"" said Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it was considering legal action to block the tariffs from going into effect. 
 Some GOP senators are rankled, too, most notably Charles Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
 ""This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent,"" Grassley said. 
 Congressional aides from both parties said that it's too soon to say whether Trump's proposal will derail the agreement. But it does make it harder for lawmakers to assess how the agreement would improve the economic landscape if the tariffs on Mexico go into place. 
 Democrats seem mostly concerned with other breaking developments. 
 Hours before Trump announced his tariff plan, his administration tried to set up the agreement for a possible congressional vote before the August recess. The administration completed the formal steps necessary to start the clock for submitting legislation to Congress. 
 Pelosi said that was ""not a positive step"" and ""indicates a lack of knowledge on the part of the administration on the policy and process to pass a trade agreement."" 
 Democrats want to strengthen enforcement of labor and environmental standards in Mexico.  They have pushed for Mexico to change labor laws that have encouraged wages as low as $1 or $2 per hour at some plants, giving U.S. companies a strong incentive to move operations south of the U.S.-Mexico border. 
 Mexico lawmakers have approved a law that requires secret-ballot union votes and proof of workers' consent for contracts. Democrats in Washington want to ensure follow-through, and Pelosi still hold the final say in determining when, or if, the agreement comes up for a vote. 
 Pelosi also joined several Republican senators in slamming Trump's tariff threat, saying it is ""not rooted in wise trade policy but has more to do with bad immigration policy on his part."" 
 ""Yet again, the president is sowing chaos over the border instead of delivering solutions for American workers and for American consumers,"" Pelosi said. 
 White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said the tariffs should not jeopardize passage of the trade pact and that the president simply wants Mexico to do more to stem the flow of migrants. 
 She said the White House is confident it would pass the Democratic-run House, if Pelosi put it to a vote. 
 Trump said he had the authority to impose a 5 percent levy on all goods imported from Mexico and pledged to increase those duties to as high as 25 percent if Mexico did not dramatically to reduce the number of migrants crossing the border. 
 Investors have responded negatively, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing Friday down roughly 355 points, or 1.4%. 
 Still, Conway told reporters that ""tariffs are a good way to get a trading partner's attention, and apparently it did."" 
 Mexico's foreign relations secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, announced that he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would lead talks Wednesday in Washington, a move seen as potentially easing tensions and avoiding retaliatory tariffs. 
 Both Mexico and Canada are moving ahead with steps toward ratifying the trade agreement. 
 Canada's foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, indicated that it's up to the U.S. and Mexico to work out their dispute. ""This is a bilateral issue,"" she said.

 Two Ottawa residents were arrested Thursday after police found 42 jewelers bags of suspected heroin in their vehicle. 
 Kendrix C. Williams, 67, of 701 E. Superior St., Apt. B, Ottawa and Cassandra M. Clark, 34, of 701 E. Superior St., Apt. B, Ottawa both were charged with unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, a Class 1 felony punishable by 4-15 years in prison, Ottawa police said. 
 On Thursday, the Ottawa Police Department received an anonymous tip of heroin being brought from Joliet to Ottawa. As a result, Ottawa officers located the suspected vehicle and made a traffic stop on the vehicle for traffic violations. During the course of the traffic stop, the department’s K9 “Gussy” performed a free air sniff of the vehicle and alerted officers to the presence of narcotics in the vehicle. 
 Both suspects are being held at the La Salle County jail on a $1 million bond, with 10 percent needed to be released. Ottawa police were assisted by Tri-County Drug Enforcement Narcotic Team.

89432,"U.S.-China set to clash at security summit despite ""constructive"" talks 
 By Idrees Ali

 May 31, 2019 
 Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe meet before the start of their meeting in Singapore 
 More 
 By Idrees Ali 
 SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese and U.S. defense chiefs held ""constructive"" talks on Friday but were expected to clash over China's growing global security role at a weekend Asia security summit. 
 A U.S. military report on the Indo-Pacific region, to be released on Saturday alongside a speech by acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, sharply criticizes Beijing's security policies, according to a draft seen by Reuters. 
 The United States and China are locked in an escalating trade war and are at odds over a range of issues from the disputed South China Sea to democratic Taiwan, claimed by China as its sacred territory and to be taken by force if needed. 
 After the bilateral meeting in Singapore, Wu Qian, China’s defense ministry spokesman, told reporters that while the talks were constructive, Defense Minister Wei Fenghe had flagged ""unconstructive"" U.S. words and actions over Taiwan. 
 China has been particularly incensed by recent U.S. Navy patrols in the Taiwan Strait, U.S. legislation in support of Taiwan and a meeting between Taiwan’s national security chief David Lee and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton. 
 ""The United States should not underestimate China’s determination, will and capabilities to safeguard its sovereignty and territory,"" Wu said. 
 Lieutenant Colonel Joe Buccino, a Pentagon spokesman, said Shanahan found their 20-minute meeting ""constructive and productive"". 
 ""The two leaders discussed ways to build military-to-military relations that reduce the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation between our nations,"" Buccino said. 
 He added that Shanahan discussed how the two militaries could better cooperate to enforce North Korea sanctions. 
 Prior to the meeting, Shanahan told reporters that the relationship between the two militaries had ""a lot of potential"" and he would discuss proposals to improve relations with Wei. 
 CALL OUT CHINESE BEHAVIOR 
 Nevertheless, Shanahan - who on his first day in his role in January said the U.S. military would focus on ""China, China, China"" - said he would use a speech on Saturday at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore to call out Chinese actions. 
 ""This part might be viewed as spicy, kind of call out good behaviors, bad behaviors,"" Shanahan said, adding that China's military actions in the South China Sea had been excessive. 
 China and the United States have repeatedly traded barbs over what Washington says is Beijing's militarization of the South China Sea by building military installations on artificial islands and reefs. 
 China claims almost all of the strategic waterway and blames the United States and its allies for escalating tensions by carrying out naval operations in the region. 
 ""They argue that it is defensive, it looks like it’s a bit overkill, surface to air missiles, long runways... it seems excessive,"" Shanahan said. 
 A draft Pentagon report titled ""Indo-Pacific Strategy report,"" which is expected to be published on Saturday, was critical on Chinese actions in the region. It is unclear whether any changes will be made to the report before publication. 
 ""The People's Republic of China (PRC), under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), undermines the international system from within by exploiting its benefits while simultaneously eroding the values and principles of the rules-based order,"" says the report, signed by Shanahan. 
 The nearly 55-page report says the Pentagon's strategy in the Indo-Pacific region is to improve preparedness in the region, strengthen alliances, and increase multilateral arrangements with other countries in the region.

 Lest I forget Mr President, Engr. Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola will not disappoint 
 On 
 A sense of a new dawn beckons as I write this piece, about the immediate past Governor of the State of Osun, Engr. Ogbeni Rauf Olusoji Aregbesola. 
 Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola 
 How I will govern Lagos – Sanwo-Olu(Opens in a new browser tab) 
 My resolve to write about this humble man of the people, whom I have known for a reasonable length of time and trusted. 
 He is an impeccable man of immutable candour, he is urbane and ethical, he is not given for pretence by any measure, or grandstanding on any issue a cultured, relatable and accessible personality of note. 
 A alumnus of the Prestigious Ibadan Polytechnic, one of the foremost tertiary institutions of higher learning in the country, where he majored in Mechanical Engineering, and graduated with flying colours. 
 He was one of the most luminous member of the cabinet, during his tenure as commissioner of Works in Lagos State. The legacy of his stewardship, remains the benchmark, on which successive Commissioners of Works in Lagos State, draws inspirations of an indelible proportion. 
 Then enters his tenure, as the Governor of the State of Osun, where his incredible vision and passion for a greater Osun State, remains stronger by the day. 
 His acknowledged achievements index in the State of Osun, speaks volume. So let me be consistent. 
 On education, it was reasonably possible to state that education ranks as a key signature flagship along with other factors, that anchored his administration on a high successful note during his tenure as the Governor of the State. 
 The massive infrastructural development focus of his administration during his tenure, and the deliberate attempt at expanding the state schools space at all levels, prompted an unprecedented enrolment of the citizens of school age, to register into the various schools of choice. 
 The pioneering drive of the schools feeding programme by his administration, in all the schools, the intervention truly deserves commendation, as it was the first of its kind in the country, and it became an instant milestone of hope for many. 
 The training of more qualified school teachers to handle the envisaged high influx of new school entrants, is to be commended, it bears testimony for the sound calculation metrics of his administration that encouraged and supervised peaceful bonding of all the categories of schools of different religious faiths for the first time in the State of Osun. 
 The introduction of e-learning tablets concept (OPON IMO),  was truly an insightful strategy by his administration during his tenure, it was a bold attempt at simplifying the mode of the learning process, and also, for a faster articulation of the core subjects of learning, and more importantly, it was for the facilitation of the intellectual development of the final year high school students of the state. 
 The success recorded since it’s introduction, remains very encouraging indeed. 
 He introduced the free uniforms to pupils in all public schools in the state. The setting up of the school garment manufacturing company, also employed a sizeable number of workers in the state. 
 He set up a strong cadet force, known as the Osun Youth Empowerment Scheme (OYES)  during his tenure, and they have remained ever so diligently focused, and a great source of pride. It was set up to help stem the high number of youth unemployment in the state. 
 The Agricultural sector of the state, received a boost. During his tenure, roads were constructed into the hinterlands, where most farmers cultivated their farm produce. The construction of various roads by his administration, helped in the transportation of the farm produce, from the farms to the end consumers. 
 The massive roads and bridges construction initiative drive in the state, received a big commendation from the good people of the state of Osun. 
 In the state of Osun, under Engr. Rauf Olasoji Aregbesola, during his tenure as Governor, I cannot remember in the recent past, any Government that filled me with so much positives, in terms of developmental achievements on the side of the state and its citizens. 
 Engr. Ogbeni Olasoji Aregbesola, political odyssey, travails, successes, et al, remains edifying all round. 
 In the circumstances, Mr. President, I hereby attest to the fact that Engr. Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, the immediate past Governor of the state of Osun, is very focused and cerebral. 
 An amazing workaholic phenomenon, he will no doubt be a formidable asset if you graciously approve of his appointment in your esteemed cabinet in your second term journey as our beloved President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. 
 He will certainly not disappoint your Excellency. 
 I thank you most profoundly for your time and attention.

 LeMahieu leads Happ, surging Yankees past Red Sox 4-1

 AP Baseball Writer 
 NEW YORK (AP) - Don't let DJ LeMahieu's professional demeanor fool you. 
 ""He's out there to rip your heart out,"" New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, ""and he plays with an edge."" 
 AlertMe 
 A pumped-up LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. 
 Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single , and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. 
 ""A really good, clean game and probably a game you need to play when you're up against Sale and the Red Sox,"" Boone said. 
 Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay - and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. 
 Rafael Devers homered early for the third-place Red Sox (29-28), who fell 8½ games back in the division. That's the furthest they've been behind the Yankees since finishing the 2015 season nine games in the dust. 
 ""As much as you can point a finger at anybody in this clubhouse, you can point them at me, too,"" Sale said. ""We've got to find a way to start winning games, get some zip back in us and rolling some wins out. 
 ""We just have to find that something. Whatever it is, where it is - change of socks, frozen pizza, I don't know."" 
 New York has won 14 of 17 and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. 
 After the teams were rained out Thursday night, the Yankees tagged Sale for four runs and seven hits in six innings. The left-hander struck out 10 for a sixth double-digit strikeout game in his past eight starts, but pounded his fist into his glove in frustration after LeMahieu's opposite-field homer in the fifth. 
 Batting leadoff, LeMahieu also doubled off the right-center wall in the third and clapped at second base after driving in New York's first run following singles by Gio Urshela and Brett Gardner. 
 ""The way the fans are in it, it feels pretty close to the playoffs and you don't get that in too many places,"" said LeMahieu, who made a sprawling defensive play at second base as well. ""It's a big game. Just the atmosphere out there, the rivalry. Just excited."" 
 A two-time All-Star, 2016 NL batting champion and winner of three Gold Gloves, LeMahieu left Colorado to sign a $24 million, two-year contract with the Yankees last winter. 
 ""I think he does loving playing in this environment,"" Boone said. ""Good to see him go out there and kind of set the tone for us."" 
 The 30-year-old Sale entered with a 1.87 ERA versus the Yankees, the lowest mark in the live ball era for any pitcher with at least 100 innings against New York. 
 But after signing a $160 million, six-year contract in March, he's tied for the major league lead in losses. 
 ""It's not where we want to be. It's not where I want to be. It's not who I am. It's not who I've ever been,"" Sale said. ""I've got to find a way to be better."" 
 Happ gave up one run and three hits with five strikeouts in five innings , improving to 9-4 with a 3.00 ERA against Boston. 
 Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. 
 ""That's the way they drew it up in the offseason and so far, it's working,"" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. ""I know they don't have their big guys, but what they have right now is good. ... They're playing great baseball."" 
 BIG MISTAKE 
 With two runners on and Andrew Benintendi up, Eduardo Núñez was picked off second base by catcher Gary Sánchez to end the fifth. 
 ""He knows that can't happen. Seems like the last seven, eight days, we've regressed back to being sloppy around the bases,"" Cora said. ""It was a big play in the game."" 
 BEAST OF THE EAST 
 New York is 17-4 versus AL East opponents, the best mark for any team against its own division. 
 TRAINER'S ROOM 
 Red Sox: RHP Nathan Eovaldi threw 22 pitches to teammates Brock Holt and Michael Chavis in a simulated game, the first hitters Eovaldi has faced since April 23 surgery to remove a loose body from his right elbow. His next step will be determined Saturday. ... 1B Steve Pearce, the 2018 World Series MVP, was pulled in the second inning with back spasms and replaced by Chavis. Pearce is day to day. ... LHP Eduardo Rodríguez was available out of the bullpen after being rescheduled to start Tuesday in Kansas City. Prior to Thursday night's rainout, Rodríguez (5-3, 5.04 ERA) was slated to start Friday, but the Red Sox simply pushed back Sale instead. 
 Yankees: CC Sabathia (right knee inflammation) is set to come off the injured list and start the series finale Sunday night against LHP David Price. ... RHP Dellin Betances (right shoulder impingement) played long toss and said his arm felt good following Thursday's bullpen. His third bullpen is scheduled for Sunday and if that goes well, the next step could be facing hitters. ... Didi Gregorius (Tommy John surgery) went 0 for 5 and played all nine innings at shortstop in a rehab game with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... OF Giancarlo Stanton, sidelined since March 31, is getting close to facing pitching and starting a rehab assignment, Boone said. 
 UP NEXT 
 Red Sox: RHP Rick Porcello (4-4, 4.41 ERA) is 4-1 with a 2.94 ERA in his last eight starts, and Boston has won seven of them. The 2016 AL Cy Young Award winner, from nearby New Jersey, is 10-8 with a 3.11 ERA in 22 games versus the Yankees. He went 2-0 with a 2.31 ERA in four starts against them last year - and also won a playoff series clincher at Yankee Stadium. 
 Yankees: RHP Domingo Germán (9-1, 3.43) leads the majors in wins. He won six straight starts before getting hammered for a career-high seven runs and nine hits, including four homers, over five innings Sunday in a no-decision at Kansas City.  All rights reserved.

 On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced plans to levy new tariffs on goods imported from Mexico. 
 Those tariffs could hit states where trade with Mexico is a big part of the economy especially hard. 
 States that border Mexico and big manufacturing states that rely on distributed, continent-wide supply chains could be affected. 
 Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . 
 President Donald Trump has threatened a new round of tariffs on imported goods from Mexico, and it could hit certain states especially hard. 
 On Thursday, Trump announced plans to implement a 5% tariff on imported goods from Mexico in an effort to put pressure on the country to curb migrant flows into the United States. 
 The proposed tariffs would go into effect on June 10, and would increase by 5% every month until hitting a maximum of 25% in October — unless Mexico takes action to reduce border crossings. 
 Tariffs can have a negative economic impact on both countries involved in a trade dispute. Mexican firms exporting goods to the US could see a drop in sales, and American importers will likely see an increase in prices. 
 Friday morning, stocks were falling in industries like auto manufacturing , which has supply chains distributed across North America that could be seriously interrupted by increased trade barriers between the US and Mexico. Chipotle, which relies on imports of avocados and other produce from Mexico, also saw a drop in its stock price .

 If the proposed tariffs come into effect, certain states where trade with Mexico makes up a big part of the economy could be hardest hit. 
 The US Census Bureau publishes annual figures for the total amount of goods imported and exported in each US state and DC . The Bureau breaks out import and export volumes for the 25 biggest trading partners for each state. 
 Big state economies that border Mexico exported a large volume of goods to that country in 2017. Texas had nearly $98 billion in exports, and California had nearly $27 billion. While it doesn't border Mexico, auto-industry supply chains contribute to Michigan's $12.5 billion in exports in that year. 
 Meanwhile, states with smaller economies and that are geographically further away from Mexico exported fewer goods. Hawaii's goods exports to Mexico in 2017 came to only about $1.4 million, and Alaska exported just $21 million in goods. 
 Here's each state's total 2017 export volume to Mexico, according to the Census Bureau: 
 Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from US Census Bureau 
 Imports show a similar picture. Texas imported nearly $90 billion in goods from Mexico in 2017, while Michigan imported about $53 billion and California about $46 billion. Meanwhile, smaller northern states like Montana, Vermont, and Maine imported much less from Mexico:",1
62776,"Performer of the Week: Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge 
 TVLine - By Team TVLine 
 THE SHOW | Fleabag 
 THE EPISODE | “Episode 4” (May 17, 2019) 
 THE PERFORMANCE | It’s fitting that Season 2 of Amazon’s top-notch comedy import finds its title character grappling with religion and chasing after a hot priest… because Waller-Bridge’s lead performance is something like a miracle. Effortlessly witty and disarmingly blunt, Fleabag shares her inner thoughts with us by addressing the camera directly, wearing her many flaws right there on her sleeve, and we can’t help but fall under her spell, thanks to Waller-Bridge’s magnificently charming turn. 
 We could honor her for any Season 2 episode, really — every last arched eyebrow is a delight — but let’s focus on the fourth installment, because that’s the one that cracked through Fleabag’s hard shell of cynical sarcasm to reveal the tender soul underneath. She still fired off plenty of sharp quips, of course, but while showing the hot priest around her guinea pig-themed café, Fleabag pointedly avoided talking about the death of her mother (and her best friend Boo), and Waller-Bridge allowed years of repressed pain to flash across her face. Later, Fleabag and the priest shared some booze and climbed into the confession booth, and Waller-Bridge was achingly vulnerable as Fleabag admitted she doesn’t know what the hell she’s doing: “I just think I want someone to tell me how to live my life, Father, because so far, I think I’ve been getting it wrong.” It’s a stunning thing to hear from such a self-confident woman, but Waller-Bridge sold the transition with her patient, poignant work. 
 Along with her starring role, Waller-Bridge also writes every episode of Fleabag, too, so we have to give her bonus points for that, right? But even judged solely on her acting, Waller-Bridge is incredible, with the character of Fleabag standing as one of TV’s very best comedy creations in recent years. We know Waller-Bridge has already said this will be Fleabag‘s last season… but we’re on our knees praying that’s not true. 
 HONORABLE MENTION | “Trixie hasn’t lost her gift,” Alma observed early on in Deadwood: The Movie — and neither has Paula Malcomson . Reprising her role as the frank and foul-mouthed prostitute after 13 years, Malcomson did not miss a single beat, quickly making herself known with a pointed (and yes, expletive-laced) harangue aimed at visiting Senator George Hearst, with whom she has a, um, “complicated” history. Malcomson again gave it her all when Trixie gave birth, switching from a shrieking and groaning mom-to-be to a beaming coddler of a newborn. The scenes that had the deepest emotional resonance for longtime viewers, though, were between Trixie and Al, first as she was expressed (some) contrition for revealing her faked death to Hearst, and then, at episode’s end, when she held Al’s hand and led him in the Lord’s Prayer… which with his final breaths, he gave his own Swearengen spin. 
 HONORABLE MENTION | Imagine auditioning for an acting role directed by your ex… and the role is clearly based on you. That’s the awkward position Fosse/Verdon ‘s Ann Reinking found herself in during this week’s finale, and Margaret Qualley brought Ann’s anger to life with an inner fire that positively crackled. Reading for a part in Bob Fosse’s autobiographical movie All That Jazz, Ann visibly bristled as she recognized that the script was directly lifted from their relationship. Qualley’s eyes watered and her body trembled as Bob pushed her to do the lines over and over again until she exploded in a rage, with the still-raw trauma from their fizzled romance spilling out all over the audition room. An impressed Bob cast her on the spot… and honestly, we would’ve, too. 
 HONORABLE MENTION | Oh, what a Season 2 Good Girls ’ Beth endured, having figuratively and then literally gotten into bed with Rio. It culminated in a finale in which Christina Hendricks showed us Beth’s internal struggle reach a tipping point. In two quieter scenes, Hendricks radiated a calmness and warmth — as Beth and Dean took a pierogis-scented trip down memory lane, and then as she laid out her sacrificial plan to Ruby (when not pondering Beyonce’s opening number). But the mood was much different in the climactic, game changing moment where Rio tasked his padawan with shooting dead a tied-up Agent Turner. “You put it on me, you put everything on me!” roared Beth, Hendricks face aflame with conflict. “Nothing’s ever on you! You think he’s my problem?? He’s not my problem” — and on that note, Beth instead put her bullets into Rio. The look on Beth’s face as she shambled home, shellshocked, before breaking down in Dean’s arms, said it all.

 ST. LOUIS (AP) — The Latest on Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final (all times local): 
 8:50 p.m. 
 The St. Louis Blues have pulled rookie goaltender Jordan Binnington after falling behind Boston 5-1 in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final. 
 Binnington helped St. Louis climb out of last place in the NHL back in January and has been rock-solid for the Blues in their push to win their first championship. But he was shelled frequently by the Bruins and coach Craig Berube sent in Jake Allen midway through the second period. 
 Boston opened a 4-0 lead before Ivan Barbashev put the blues on the board 11:05 into the second off a pass from lineup newcomer Zach Sanford. He banked the puck off both of Boston defenseman Charlie McAvoy's skates. 
 Torey Krug answered for Boston just 1:07 later in the third power play goal in as many chances for Boston. That was it for Binnington, who had never been pulled in his young NHL career. He gave up five goals on 19 shots. Allen had not played since April 3 at Chicago. 
 ___ 
 8:30 p.m. 
 The Boston Bruins are running the St. Louis Blues out of their own building in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final. 
 David Pastrnak scored a power-play goal 41 seconds into the second period to put the Bruins up 4-0. It came on the penalty the Blues got for an unsuccessful coach's challenge on Boston's goal with 7.8 seconds left in the first that made it 3-0. 
 St. Louis rookie goaltender Jordan Binnington has allowed four goals on 13 shots. Coach Craig Berube didn't summon backup Jake Allen for the switch. 
 Binnington stopped 21 of 23 shots in the Blues' Game 2 victory. 
 ___ 
 8:05 p.m. 
 The Boston Bruins are in command after the first period of Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final in St. Louis. 
 Patrice Bergeron, Charlie Coyle and Sean Kuraly scored to give Boston a 3-0 lead after the first 20 minutes. It is the first Cup final game in St. Louis since 1970 and the crowd was raucous from the beginning. 
 The Bruins withstood an early surge by the home team and ended up scoring three times on four shots against goalie Jordan Binnington. After being outshot 5-0 in the first six minutes, Boston outshot St. Louis 12-3 the rest of the way. 
 Bergeron scored on a power play and Coyle stayed hot with his eighth goal of the playoffs when he scored on a 2-on-1 with Marcus Johansson with 2:20 left in the first. Kuraly scored his second of the series with 7.8 just seconds left. 
 Blues coach Craig Berube unsuccessfully challenged that goal for offside and the Blues were forced into another penalty kill. 
 ___ 
 7:50 p.m. 
 Patrice Bergeron has given Boston an early 1-0 lead in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final against St. Louis. 
 Bergeron deflected Torey Krug's point shot in 21 seconds into the power play and just over 10 minutes into the first period. Boston's power play is now 3 for 11 in the series. 
 It is the first Cup final game in St. Louis since 1970. The best-of-seven series is tied 1-1. 
 ___ 
 7:26 p.m. 
 The first Stanley Cup Final game in St. Louis since 1970 is underway. 
 Jaden Schwartz stared straight ahead and Brayden Schenn looked around at the crowd during pregame introductions. National anthem singer Charles Glenn, who's battling multiple sclerosis, let the crowd singe a verse of the ""Star-Spangled Banner."" And young Laila Anderson who's fighting a rare immune disorder, took the microphone and addressed the packed arena. 
 Then the puck was dropped on Game 3 between the Boston Bruins and Blues. The series is tied 1-1. 
 ___ 
 7 p.m. 
 St. Louis native and Blues super fan Jon Hamm is fired up about their run to the Stanley Cup Final. 
 The actor of ""Mad Men"" fame clapped his way into the room when he talked to reporters before the first Cup Final game in the city in 49 years. He was part comedian, part historian, part St. Louisan but mostly just a fan. 
 He said: ""I really do think —who cares what I think— I'm honestly like an actor that is just a fan of the team. You can pull anybody off the concourse and they'll say the same thing. But I think that people are really in a different way this year believers."" 
 The Blues and Boston are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven final. Hamm wasn't born yet when the Blues went to the Cup Final in 1968, '69 and '70 so he said he has no idea what this means to him. 
 Recalling his experience being in the stadium for the St. Louis Cardinals' 1982 World Series win, Hamm said, ""If this happens, it's going to be that times infinity."" 
 ___ 
 2:20 p.m. 
 Zach Sanford grew up a Boston Bruins fan. Tonight he'll play against them in the Stanley Cup Final. 
 The native of Salem, Massachusetts, will suit up for the St. Louis Blues in Game 3 in place of suspended forward Oskar Sunqvist. It's his first playoff action since April 14 against Winnipeg. 
 Sanford says there are ""a lot of players that have never got this chance and there's people who never even made it this far."" 
 He adds it's an ""awesome"" opportunity to try to ""help the team get a win."" 
 He's over his Bruins fandom, but that hasn't stopped some buddies back home from texting they're rooting for the Bruins more than him. 
 ___ 
 2 p.m. 
 Zach Sanford is expected to see his first action in more than six weeks when the St. Louis Blues host the Boston Bruins in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final. 
 Sanford enters the Blues lineup for forward Oskar Sundqvist, who was suspended one game for boarding and concussing Boston defenseman Matt Grzelcyk and potentially knocking him out for the rest of the series. Sanford hasn't played since Game 3 of the first round against Winnipeg on April 14. 
 Jordan Nolan, who hasn't played an NHL game since January, says he'll skate in warmups but doesn't expect to play. After Robby Fabbri replaced injured forward Robert Thomas in Game 2, the Blues' depth has been tested. 
 John Moore will replace Grzelcyk in Boston's lineup, and center Patrice Bergeron will play after skipping practice Friday for maintenance. The same goes for St. Louis top-line wingers Jaden Schwartz and Vladimir Tarasenko. 
 The series is tied at 1-1.

78095,"Search underway for eight climbers missing in Indian Himalayas 
 Posted: 7:34 AM, Jun 01, 2019 
 Updated: 2019-06-01 14:34:51Z 
 By: CNN Newsource 
 A search is underway for seven climbers — four Britons, two Americans and an Australian — and their Indian liaison officer, who went missing a week ago during an expedition in the Indian Himalayas, local authorities say. 
 The group was attempting to scale Nanda Devi East, one of the highest and most difficult to climb peaks in India at just over 24,000 feet (7,400 meters) tall, local Uttarakhand District Magistrate, Vijay Kumar Jogdande, told CNN. 
 The missing eight were part of a larger team of 12 who set off from the village of Munsiyari on May 13. But 12 days later, on May 25, only four of the group returned to base camp, said Uttarakhand's Senior District Official, R.D. Paliwal. 
 The entire group was supposed to reach its base camp on May 26, according to Himalayan Run & Trek, the agency which arranged the expedition. The base camp is located at 19,685 feet (6,000 meters) above sea level. 
 The company waited a few days after the remaining members of the team failed to arrive before alerting authorities of their disappearance on May 31, Jogdande said. 
 The Indian liaison officer who is among the missing is from the Indian Mountaineering foundation, based in New Delhi. 
 The UK Foreign Office said in a statement it was in contact with Indian authorities following reports that the climbers were missing. 
 Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also said it was ""providing consular assistance to the family of an Australian that may be among a group of trekkers missing in the Nanda Devi area of India."" 
 Three search teams have now reached the first base camp, which is 25 kilometers below the peak. Another team, equipped with medical and civil supplies, is also on its way. A military aircraft is expected to be sent tomorrow to help with the rescue effort. 
 It is unclear whether the climbers went missing during their ascent or descent, or the cause of their disappearance. 
 It follows the deaths of 11 climbers on Mount Everest this year, amid extraordinary images of queues of people waiting to get to the summit, prompting fresh concerns over the increased commercialization of mountaineering expeditions.

 NGO approaches Navghar police after spotting pictures of a camp at Seven Eleven Academy, which is owned by BJP MLA Narendra Mehta, on Facebook. 
 The Thane Rural police have started an inquiry into a training camp organised by the Bajrang Dal at a Mira Road school, in which students were allegedly given weapons training. 
 The probe was initiated after an NGO, Democratic Youth Federation of India, brought the matter to the notice of the police. 
 The NGO approached the Navghar police on Wednesday after spotting pictures of the camp at Seven Eleven Academy, which is owned by BJP MLA Narendra Mehta, on Facebook. A user named Prakash Gupta shared the pictures, stating that it is being held from May 25 to June 1. The pictures showed boys loading and handling several rifles on the premises. 
 “Some of the children seemed to be minors and it is dangerous for them to handle firearms. The Bajrang Dal is a hard line Hindu organisation and has been blamed for repeated instances of violence across the country,” said advocate Sanjay Pande, secretary of the organisation. 
 Mr. Pande said he, along with other members of his organisation, sought police action against the school and the Bajrang Dal. “The police refused to entertain our request and we left after submitting an application. On Friday, we met Sub Divisional Police Officer Atul Kulkarni and discussed the matter with him. He assured us that necessary action would be taken,” he said. 
 Mr. Kulkarni said inquiries had been initiated into the matter. “We contacted the organisers of the training camp and they claimed that they had requisite licences and permissions for the guns. We have asked them to produce the documents for examination. If any discrepancies are found, action will be taken accordingly,” Mr. Kulkarni said, adding no FIR had been filed as yet. 
 Mr. Mehta could not be reached for comment.

 New junior Agriculture Minister defeated Jaswant Singh’s son in Barmer 
 The induction of first-time BJP MP from Barmer, Kailash Choudhary, into the Union Cabinet — though a surprise — is tacitly linked with his victory over former BJP veteran Jaswant Singh’s son Manvendra Singh in the Lok Sabha election by a margin of 3.23 lakh votes in a challenging contest. Mr. Singh had crossed over to Congress before the 2018 Rajasthan Assembly election. 
 As the Jat face of the BJP, Mr. Choudhary, 45, has been an active Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh worker and was earlier elected an MLA from Barmer district’s Baytu seat. He raised the issues of national security and defence preparedness in the election campaign in the border constituency. He was made the Minister of State for Agriculture on Friday. 
 Two more Ministers 
 In addition to Mr. Choudhary’s entry, two Union Ministers of State from Rajasthan have been inducted into the Narendra Modi government in its second term, taking the number to three, which is less than five who occupied the Ministerial office during the first term. While Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s rank has been elevated to that of a Union Minister, Arjun Ram Meghwal continues to be the Minister of State. 
 Mr. Shekhawat, 51, defeated Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s son Vaibhav Gehlot in his home turf Jodhpur. He is known for his active use of social media and is the most followed Indian politician on Quora. He has been given the newly-introduced Jal Shakti portfolio. 
 Mr. Meghwal, 65, who defeated his cousin and Congress candidate Madan Gopal Meghwal in Bikaner Lok Sabha constituency, has been elected for the third consecutive term. He has been made the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs as well as Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises. He had taken voluntary retirement from Indian Administrative Service to join politics in 2009. 
 However, the exclusion of some veteran leaders, including Rashtriya Loktantrik Party chief Hanuman Beniwal who fought and won the Lok Sabha polls from Nagaur as an ally of BJP after joining NDA, was unexpected, according to the political observers. 
 Ministers of State Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and P.P. Chaudhary were dropped, despite winning with handsome margins from Jaipur Rural and Pali.

99404,"Ghosts didn't vote in Lok Sabha polls, all were humans, says EC rubbishing claims on data mismatch 
 India Today Web Desk 
 Ex-Aviation Minister in trouble

 The Election Commission of India on Saturday issued a clarification saying all votes in 2019 Lok Sabha election were cast by humans and not ghosts. The clarification was in response to allegations that there was a mismatch between total votes polled and total votes counted on EVMs during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. 
 Since May 23, when results of the Lok Sabha election were announced, concerns have been raised that in many constituencies the total number of votes polled (as per the voter turnout figures released by EC) does not match with the votes counted on the result day. These alleged excess votes are termed as 'ghost votes'. 
 Media reports had pointed out that in some constituencies the total votes polled was less than that votes counted on EVMs while in some the votes polled were more than the ones counted on May 23. 
 In a report, The Quint claimed that its analysis shows that this mismatch was found in 373 Lok Sabha constituencies. The difference in votes, as per this report, ranged between 18,331 additional votes in Tamil Nadu's Kanchipuram seat to 19,776 deficit votes in Tripura West. 
 The Election Commission has now reasoned that the voting percentage data put out by it on its website was only provisional and was thus subject to change. ""The provisional voter turnout data reported on ECI website is only the tentative number of voters and not the final numbers,"" the EC said in a press release. 
 What this means is that the EC is saying the figures it had put as ""final voter turnout"" was actually provisional data. As a result, since the voter turnout data was not final, a mismatch with votes counted on EVM was natural to occur. The Commission has said that data on the final voter turnout will be released soon. 
 ""In earlier elections, it used to take months to collect such authenticated election data from all the returning officers. Even in 2014, it took between two to three months after the declaration of results to collect and collate such data in authenticated form. Due to the innovative IT initiatives taken by the Commission this time, the final data on votes counted has been made available within a few days of declaration of results. The reconciliation of voters' data for all parliamentary constituencies (PCs) have been completed in all states and the Index Forms of all 542 PCs are expected to reach ECI from the returning officers shortly, which after compilation, shall be immediately be made public by the Election Commission."" 
 ""Therefore it is incorrect inference to find ghost voters when there are none,"" the Election Commission said.

71930,"Companies report progress on blood tests to detect cancer 
  
 Friday 
 May 31, 2019 at 10:15 PM 
 A California company says its experimental blood test was able to detect many types of cancer at an early stage and gave very few false alarms in a study that included people with and without the disease. 
 A California company says its experimental blood test was able to detect many types of cancer at an early stage and gave very few false alarms in a study that included people with and without the disease. 
 Grail Inc. gave results in a news release on Friday and will report them Saturday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. They have not been published in a journal or reviewed by other scientists. 
 Many companies are trying to develop early detection ""liquid biopsy"" tests that capture bits of DNA that cancer cells shed into blood. 
 On Thursday, Johns Hopkins University scientists launched a company called Thrive Earlier Detection Corp. to develop its CancerSEEK test, which yielded results similar to Grail's more than a year ago. 
 Grail is closely watched because of the extraordinary investment it's attracted — more than $1 billion from Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and other celebrities. 
 The new results included 2,300 people, 60% with cancer and 40% not known to have it. The test detected 55% of known cancers and gave false alarms for 1%. The detection rate was better — 76% — for a dozen cancers that collectively account for nearly two thirds of cancer deaths in the U.S., including lung, pancreatic, esophageal and ovarian. 
 The test found only about a third of cancers at the very earliest stage but as many as 84% that had started to spread but not widely. 
 It also suggested where the cancer may be in 94% of cases and was right about that 90% of the time. 
 That's the most encouraging part because you don't want to tell people they may have cancer and then need to do a lot of other tests to figure out where, said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society. 
 ""They still have a long way to go"" to prove the test's worth as a screening tool, but these results are encouraging, he said. 
 Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, called the low rate of false alarms ""remarkable."" 
 ""I have little doubt that in the next several years we're going to have what is probably a true early detection test"" but the technology still needs to improve and to be tried in large groups of people without known cancers where the detection rate may not be as good, he said. 
 The biggest question, he said, is ""will it make a difference in outcomes"" such as whether it helps people live longer, the ultimate measure of a screening test's worth. 
 Grail's test has not been compared to mammography, colonoscopy or other screening tools and is not intended to replace them, said the company's chief scientific officer, Dr. Alex Aravanis. Many deadly cancers that the Grail test detected have no screening tests now, he noted. 
 It's not clear what evidence the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would require to consider for approval. Sometimes tests can be sold through looser lab accreditation pathways rather than by seeking FDA approval. 
 Grail and Thrive already have larger studies underway. 
 ""We're not going to diagnose every cancer,"" but may not need to because so many are not found now until it's too late for effective treatment, said Dr. Minetta Liu, a Mayo Clinic cancer specialist who is presenting Grail's results at the cancer conference.

 Police Officers in Hospital After Riot in Migrant Hostel in Germany - Reports 
 ©                     AP Photo / Bernd Thissen 
 3 15 
 Police were summoned to an asylum shelter in a Bavarian village when its inmates started a violent brawl. However, they could not calm the troublemakers down and were attacked by migrants. Only reinforcement could tackle the uprising. 
 Six Nigerians, aged from 23 to 38, were arrested following a riot in an asylum shelter, located in a small Bavarian municipality Stephansposching, German outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports. An investigation has been launched after five policemen were injured; four of them taken to a hospital with slash wounds and eye injuries. 
 On Friday, they were summoned to the facility when its residents started to wreak havoc. According to the outlet, 30 angry refugees insulted and harassed the officials. The situation escalated when the police pulled the alleged ringleader out of the mob. Several asylum seekers attacked the officers and threw bicycles at them; the police responded with pepper spray. 
 One of the attackers jumped on the side window of a police car while the others built barricades and blocked the officers who were trying to retreat. The police called for back-up, and the authorities managed to calm the rioters only after it arrived.

 Shelters for refugees and so-called anchor centres, established to facilitate the processing of asylum applications, have repeatedly become a scene for violent crimes.  Earlier in May, police were attacked and pelted with stones in the southern German city of Regensburg as they attempted to investigate the death of a 31-year-old woman at the migrant centre there. 
 Germany continues to witness an upsurge in crime against the backdrop of the migrant crisis. One in 10 victims of serious crimes in Germany is assaulted by an asylum seeker or refugee, Die Welt reported earlier this year, citing the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). 
 Angela Merkel’s refugee policy and “open borders” approach, in particular, have prompted criticism and even protests against the government in Germany, which has become one of the countries most affected by the migrant crisis in Europe which erupted in 2015.

86151,"Warren Buffett is an increasingly expensive lunch date. 
 The winning offer for a Buffett charity lunch auction set a record for the annual event at $4.57 million. The winner, who chose to remain anonymous, can bring as many as seven friends to dine with the billionaire investor at Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in New York. 
 Buffett’s auction raises money for San Francisco-based charity Glide, an organization that his late wife Susan Buffett supported. The auction has brought Glide more than $30 million over decades, as bids climbed from thousands of dollars in the early years to millions. Among its various programs, Glide provides meals to the homeless in San Francisco, offers support to domestic violence victims and helps people find shelter. 
 “A lot of the trend lines around homelessness, poverty and inequality are getting worse. The lines outside of our doors keep getting longer,” Glide Chief Executive Officer Karen Hanrahan said in a phone interview last week ahead of the start of the auction. “The funds that we’ve raised with Warren Buffett have allowed us to be just responsive to the community and responsive to the needs of the city.” 
 While some bidders choose to remain anonymous, a few big names have scored the chance to dine with the billionaire investor. Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn was the highest bidder in 2003. Ted Weschler won two auctions and was later hired by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. as an investing deputy. 
 The $4.57 million offer beat the previous record of $3.46 million, which was first set in 2012 by an anonymous bidder and later matched in 2016. This year’s bid was about 38% higher than the winning offer in 2018. 
 The bidding war, which started late Sunday, heated up early in the week and fell fairly quiet heading into the final day of the auction. Then on Friday, a handful of bids came in that exceeded $4 million.

 PETE BUTTIGIEG 
 A woman should have the freedom to make medical decisions on her own or with the counsel of her doctor, family, and faith leaders � those whom she chooses and she trusts. The government's role should be to make sure all women have access to comprehensive affordable care, and that includes preventive care, contraceptive services, prenatal and postpartum care, and safe and legal abortion.

 KAMALA HARRIS 
 As president, Kamala will continue to champion the rights of women and girls. She�ll protect Planned Parenthood from Republican attempts to defund essential health services, nominate judges who respect Roe v.

 Blame curiosity for the ridiculous cost of cult cabs 
 news 2 hours ago The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif. — Peg Melnik The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif. 
 June 01--     Jun. 1--People are still scratching their heads over the 6-liter bottle of Screaming Eagle's 1992 Cabernet that sold for a record-breaking half a million dollars at auction in 2000. 
 With Auction Napa Valley this weekend and auction season in full throttle, it's a good time to revisit the reasons behind these high-priced wonders. Karen MacNeil, author of the ""Wine Bible"" calls cult cabs a phenomena, one that she has watched with curiosity over the years. 
 ""These are wines that possess what I call the desirability of unattainability,"" she said. ""It's not merely that they're expensive, although they are ... but with them you need a special status or a special power ... some kind of insider access. Whether or not this is true is another story, but that's the belief."" 
 For those who wonder if cult cabs are merely hype, MacNeil said that's not the case. 
 ""I don't think it's all marketing, which some people would argue that these people are just rich and good at marketing, and they may be both but they have the goods,"" she said. 
 ""They do have great pieces of ground, and they have significant skill with viticulture and winemaking, and these cult cabs are really amazing wines. It's pretty irrefutable that these are really very, very good wines. No one is pulling the wool over consumers' eyes."" 
 For those curious about the lingo of the large bottle formats that cult cabs often show up in, here's a quick look at some of them in liters: 
 750 ML -- standard -- equal to one bottle. 
 1.5 L -- magnum -- equal to two 750 ml bottles. 
 3 L -- Double Magnum -- equal to two magnums or four 750 ml bottles. 
 6 L -- Imperial -- equal to eight 750 ml bottles 
 9 L -- Salmanazar -- equal to 12 750 ml bottles. 
 Auction organizers build lots around cult cabs in large format bottles because they know top bidders often want to throw a big party. 
 ""Because of their prestige and rarity over the years, auction organizers know that the wake that builds behind these wines is a wake of curiosity,"" MacNeil said. ""As time goes on and you've heard about Harlan all these years, now you're in a position to taste it. The curiosity factor is at an all-time high for these wines.""

 Postsecondary education: And who — who — will take the road less traveled by? 
 Four years prostrate to the higher mind isn't right for everyone. Nod if you can hear me. Vigorously if you truly agree. 
 By                                                                                    Mitch Pearlstein 
 Purchase: Order Reprint 
 I have spent most of my professional life expressing ideas that cause people to shake their heads horizontally in disagreement rather than nodding vertically in approval. But I’ve seen abundant nodding in the last few years when talking about how large numbers of young Americans who are not terribly interested in attending a four-year college enroll in one anyway — pressured by parents, peers, teachers, school counselors, and the cultural, normative air they breathe. 
 More than occasionally, such young Americans wind up confirming their gut instinct that collegiate life was not for them and, sooner or later, drop out. From there, again more than occasionally, they find themselves unemployed or underemployed, in big-time student debt, proverbially living in their parents’ basement and quite possibly feeling like failures. (Cue almost everybody nodding up and down.) 
 Cratered paths like these, I go on, routinely obstruct timely entry into middle-class jobs. And these are often needless delays and losses, because other educational and career routes are primed to serve millions of young men and women, especially those who like working with their hands or are technically inclined. Their taking advantage of these paths would also simultaneously enrich our economy, particularly since thousands of well-trained baby boomers retire every day. (Cue more nodding north and south.) 
 I’ve never dealt with a vital issue where consensus is so strong — and where party affiliation and political philosophy are so irrelevant — as is the case here. Which begs many questions, starting with why the bias on behalf of four-year degrees is so strong in the U.S. in the first place. 
 A partial listing of reasons might begin with spectacles. But before looking into that, what kinds of jobs (1) generally don’t call for a four-year degree, (2) still require postsecondary training of some kind and (3) pay reasonably well? Such jobs are often referred to as “middle-skill jobs,” even though practitioners are often superbly skilled. 
 An assertion I often cite comes from Matthew B. Crawford, who runs a high-end motorcycle repair shop as well as holding a Ph.D. in political philosophy from the University of Chicago. Interesting fellow. In a distinctively excellent book, “Shop Class as Soulcraft,” he contends (I paraphrase) that it takes more cognitive firepower to figure out what’s wrong with an engine, then fix it, than it does to perform lots of chores done in cubicles. I haven’t found anyone who disagrees. 
 Here’s an abbreviated, alphabetical recitation of occupations, through the letter “e” (leaving 21 letters, and jobs like Marco Rubio’s celebrated welding, still to go). 
 Air ambulance paramedics; aircraft mechanics, artisans who hand-craft high-end furniture; auto technicians; builders of complex gas turbine generators; carpenters; cardiovascular technologists; chefs, cement masons and concrete finishers; computer support specialists; construction workers; correctional officers; decorators; dental hygienists; electricians; and entrepreneurs who run their own photography studios. 
 When it comes to educational routes, the core four are apprenticeships; one-year and two-year certificate programs; associate degrees (especially the associate in applied science, or A.A.S. kind), and job training in the military. 
 Now let’s return to spectacles. Sandra Kresbach is executive director of the American Technical Education Association. In an interview for a new book of mine, “Education Roads Less Traveled,” she talked about how most people are unaware of the key role played by technical education in research and development. I asked her to tie that blindness to the county’s preoccupation with four-year degrees as opposed to other types of postsecondary education. 
 Part of the problem, Kresbach said, is that so much pageantry surrounds college life. The sports teams, the mascots, the tradition, the huge campus life, while “technical education is very focused on what students are learning, on skill sets, on various industries, on jobs. It’s very hard for school counselors, for the media, for parents, for others to get a handle on what the lives of students in technical education are like.” 
 Kresbach got me thinking back to how I perceived — or, more accurately, dreamed about — American higher education when I first started doing so as a teen. Think elbow-patched tweed jackets, Big Games and Big Dances, with erudite conversation in between. Where might I have picked up romantic notions like those? David J. Weerts and Gwendolyn H. Freed of the University of Minnesota, and Christopher C. Morphew, now at Johns Hopkins, have written fascinatingly about how popular media, going back generations, have played a defining role in creating the “collegiate ideal.” 
 “The national preoccupation with college was initially stoked by colleges themselves, but soon thereafter, college mania was manufactured for mass consumption by people and entities outside of higher education,” they write. “Madison Avenue copywriters, Hollywood film producers, radio personalities, and New York literary agents were among those painting a picture of college life that was at once glamorous, manly and madcap.” 
 Another source of four-year bias is the clichéd conventional wisdom: “To get a good job you need a good education.” While the advice would seem to apply just as readily to sophisticated, non-four-training for a wide range of jobs, the likely interpretation is that a “good education” means a baccalaureate degree. 
 On hearing this advice, people rightly assume that those with bachelor’s degree make more money, on average. They don’t often focus on how there is significant overlap in compensation among job categories. 
 Or, as an interviewee put it, “Talented plumbers generally make more money than mediocre bureaucrats.” 
 An additional source of four-year bias has been the pointed drive, starting more than a half-century ago now, to greatly increase the college enrollment of students of color. I started at Binghamton University as a sophomore in the fall of 1967, when enrollment there was about 2,700. I don’t think more than 10 students were African-American. Seven months later, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, which, among a great many other things, highlighted the moral and political unacceptability of having African-American young people constitute far less than 1 percent of enrollment at a public university in a state like New York. Similar dynamics and aspirations continue to play out across the country. 
 Finally, there is the common, near-instinctive view on the part of parents that while it’s silly to think all young people should aim for a four-year degree, the insight doesn’t apply to their children. A 2010 Gallup poll found 92% of parents saying their own children would, in fact, go to college. It’s fair to assume most moms and dads were thinking of four-year rather than two-year schools. 
 For context, only about 35% of Americans actually wind up with a four-year degree. 
 Note: I haven’t said anything about how the GI Bill support for four-year college initiated and propelled much of this assumption that it’s for everyone. A big omission. 
 Meanwhile, of course, plenty has been written and spoken in recent years about how more young people should consider pursuing certificates and A.A.S. degrees, enabling them to move quickly into solid technical jobs that benefit the economy, too. The number of programs across the country working to interest high school students in advanced manufacturing, construction, health care, IT and other fields is surprisingly large and growing, involving educators, business leaders, union officials and others. 
 Here in Minnesota, varied efforts include the Central Minnesota Manufacturing Association (CMMA) in and around St. Cloud, Business Education Networks in Winona, and AchieveMPLS — as well as the Center of the American Experiment’s project, “Great Jobs Without a Four Year Degree.” 
 Still, what do national numbers say about actual student choices? 
 According to the U.S. Department of Education, the number of certificates awarded below the level of associate degrees in the U.S. grew by almost 500,000 between 2001 and 2011, but they fell by almost 100,000 between 2011 and 2015. 
 The number of associate degrees awarded grew by approximately 365,000 between 2001 and 2011, but they grew by only about 65,000 between 2011 and 2016. 
 This is the opposite of a surge. How to improve matters? 
 One idea is for teachers, principals and parents, when high school seniors announce what they’re doing next and where, to celebrate admission to distinguished universities, invaluable community colleges, and military service with equal enthusiasm and congratulations. 
 Granted, I don’t expect this to happen in my lifetime, but we should strive toward it. 
 Here’s another idea, possibly the most potent: Taking far greater advantage of social media in making the case made here — but with a proviso. 
 When it comes to picking platforms and figuring out what they should say and show, it would be wise to leave such tasks to the real professionals in the sphere. Meaning, men and women under 25 who reign in a digital culture that ranges from obscure to indecipherable to most anyone on the cusp of gray, much less actually gray.

99991,"Arsenal left staring into the abyss as Champions League dream turns into a nightmare 
 In addition, an inconsistent Valencia  lifted the Spanish cup as they pulled off a 2-1 result against a Barca bereft of ideas and still reeling from the beatdown handed to them on Merseyside. 
 Fingers had been pointing left and right: first it was the coach, then it was the players, then it was the general manager's fault. Since then, Ernesto Valverde's Camp Nou future has been secured. 
 And so the club have decided the faults primarily lie with those on the pitch. However, Barca blew their entire transfer budget on signing Frenkie de Jong, meaning several players will be put up for sale to raise funds and inject some fresh impetus into the side. 
 Here, Goal breaks down the 12 players that the club are ready to move on... 
 Umtiti, Rakitic & Coutinho 
 Three huge names - a World Cup winner, a World Cup runner-up and one of the most recognisable Brazilian stars in football. 
 Umtiti is largely regarded as a top player within the ranks, but niggling knee issues and the potential to make a profit on the €25 million (£22m/$28m) they paid for the 25-year-old back in 2016 has Barca ready to listen to offers for the centre-back. 
 Rakitic has been a key cog in the Barca machine since his arrival, winning four La Liga titles in the five seasons he has turned out for the club. However, with the Croatian turning 31 and teams such as Manchester United crying out for experienced heads, there is money to be made. 
 Coutinho. Oh, Coutinho. A £130m ($164m) outlay was required to land the man seen as the perfect replacement for Neymar, but the playmaker has shown only glimpses of his brilliant best since making the move from Liverpool. 
 The Reds have gone from strength to strength in his absence, while the 26-year-old continues to struggle to cement a spot in the starting XI and fans continue to question whether he can fully adapt to Valverde's system. If the right offer comes in, Coutinho is gone. 
 Cillessen, Rafinha & Vermaelen 
 Marc-Andre ter Stegen's presence between the Barca sticks has drastically limited Jasper Cillessen's playing time. But while the player himself has asked to leave, Barca want to recover at least the €16m (£14m/$18m) paid to Ajax in 2016. 
 Benfica are understood to have an interest in the Dutchman, but his parent club are currently asking for as much as €30m (£27m/$34m) for the shot-stopper, a sum the Portuguese giants simply cannot afford. 
 With Valverde staying, Rafinha is almost certain to leave. The Brazilian's famous father, Mazinho, admitted in November that he was looking for a new club for his son due to a lack of playing time under the Barca boss. 
 The 26-year-old has been out for much of the season with a cruciate ligament rupture but is expected to be back in the game near the end of June. With time to reach full fitness before the new season gets into full swing, the attacking midfielder could be a bargain. 
 A disaster of a signing since day one, Thomas Vermaelen, meanwhile, has spent five years at Barcelona and has a list of injuries almost long enough to match his total appearances for the Catalunya side. 
 The Belgian is out of contract this summer and thus will leave for free, but cutting the wage bill will please Barca at least and they can move on while pretending the whole thing didn't happen in the first place. 
 Murillo, Boateng & Todibo 
 Jeison Murillo was brought in on loan from Valencia as cover and has made a grand total of seven appearances for the club. As such, it is extremely unlikely that the Blaugrana will exercise their right to purchase the Colombian. 
 Similarly, Kevin-Prince Boateng's rebirth as a 'false 9' at Sassuolo saw him snapped up as backup for Luis Suarez, but a a combined playing time of just 303 minutes with no goals will see the Ghana international heading back to Italy . 
 Highly-rated and versatile, Jean-Clair Todibo appears set for a big future. Barca, however, are still extremely keen on bringing in De Jong's Ajax team-mate Matthijs de Ligt. Should the Camp Nou side raise the funds and bring in the Dutchman, Todibo will be allowed to move on. 
 Malcom, Denis Suarez & Andre Gomes 
 Famously hijacked from Roma at the last minute, Malcom's market value remains high - even if his total appearances don't. Barca are already looking for a buyer for the 22-year-old Brazilian, who has started in only 16 per cent of the Blaugrana's matches in 2018-19. 
 Article continues below 
 From a muscle injury at Barca to a groin issue at Arsenal , Denis Suarez, meanwhile, has had a season to forget. The midfielder, deemed surplus to requirements at Camp Nou, is understood to be more likely to leave on loan due to a lack of interest in an outright purchase. 
 Andre Gomes is another who left on loan, and, after arriving at Everton , quickly banished the memories of a string of poor performances in a Barca shirt. 
 Despite his strong performances in the Premier League, Valverde's side are still keen to sell the Portuguese and it's been reported that West Ham have already had an offer turned down.",1

 Save 
 Ellen Page says her sexuality influences what kinds of movies and TV shows she makes. 
 The 32-year-old actress says she selects projects which contain ""certain content"" and as she feels a strong representation of the LGBTQ community on-screen can ""really benefit"" young people - as well as the fact that she herself is gay so ""of course that's the stuff she wants to make"". 
 Speaking about growing up in Nova Scotia, Canada, in the late 80s, she told Diva magazine: ""Like that wasn't a positive environment in terms of LGBTQI people. 
 ""Making films, TV, documentaries that have certain content, that is massively important to me because goodness, the tiny little slither of moments I got when I was young really benefited me. 
 ""And also, I'm gay so of course that's the stuff I wanna make! It all feels organic, you know. "" 
 The 'Juno' actress recently produced and starred in 'My Days of Mercy' in which she played Lucy Morrow, an anti-death row protester fighting to save the life of her father, who embarks on a relationship with lawyer Mercy Bromage (Kate Mara). 
 Ellen explained that she chose this move as she was attracted to the ""organic"" and ""nuanced"" relationship between the two lead characters. 
 She said: ""What grabbed me first was their relationship. I thought it was so organic and nuanced in this way that really struck me. I related in many ways. "" 
 As for whether working with her real-life pal Kate made it easier to make the film, the 'Inception' star insisted that acting opposite her "" exceptional friend"" improved the ""chemistry"" on screen. 
 She said: ""Well I'll speak for myself I won't speak for Kate. For me we are so close. She's an exceptional friend and we care about each other so much. 
 ""So we really trusted each other. Obviously this is an intense film, so you have this person you can lean on. 
 ""You can see that we care for each other, you can see that chemistry. I think it actually makes it a lot easier. ""

72124,"Schmidt races to first career Sport-Modified win at Red River Valley Speedway 
 Written By: Mike Spieker / Special to The Forum | 
 May 31st 2019 - 10pm. 
 Brandon Schmidt raced to his first career IMCA sportmod feature win Friday at Red River Valley Speedway in West Fargo.     Mike Spieker / Special to The Forum 
 WEST FARGO – Brandon Schmidt is no stranger to victory lane at Red River Valley Speedway. The Hillsboro, N.D., driver has collected wins in several classes, including the IMCA stock car and hobby stock ranks. Schmidt competed in the stock car division last season, but made the move to the IMCA sportmods in 2019 with high expectations. 
 So far, those expectations have been met. 
 Schmidt took the lead with just four laps remaining in Friday’s 16-lap IMCA sportmod main event. Once out front, he drove unchallenged to the checkered flag. 
 Charlie Jensen of Pelican Rapids, Minn., looked to have the race in hand for the majority of the event. At one point, Jensen held a full straightaway lead. In the late stages of the race, Schmidt found his groove in the middle of the track and began reeling in Jensen and cut his lead down to a few car lengths.

 watch live 
 With four laps to go, Jensen’s strong run came to an end after he made heavy contact with the outside retaining wall on the back straightaway, which allowed Schmidt to take command. 
 Kelly Henderson of Minot, N.d., charged his way from 12th to finish second while Austin Veralrud rounded out the podium. Jensen was credited with a disappointing 16th-place finish. 
 The lightning sprints made their first of three scheduled appearances to the high-banked three-eighths mile oval this season. The lightning sprints are a three-quarter scale winged sprint car with a 1000cc motorcycle engine under the hood. Moorhead’s Josh Abrahamson led the opening lap before Alan Truscinski of Greenbush, Minn. took the lead on lap two. Once out front, Truscinski checked out. Abrahamson tried to mount a late-race charge, but Truscinski was able to hold him off and collect the win. 
 Tye Wilke of Detroit Lakes, Minn., looked poised to back up his Thursday night win at Norman County Raceway in Ada, Minn. The young up-and-comer in the INEX legend division stormed out to a big lead in the early going. 
 However, that advantage began to shrink as Wilke began to encounter lapped traffic. Kindred’s Sean Johnson came up from the sixth starting position to take the lead with four laps to go after Wilke bobbled in turn two. Wilke came back at Johnson on the final lap, but Johnson held on to take his second win of the season. 
 Adam Goff made the long tow from Minot to compete in the IMCA hobby stock division. Goff started fifth on the grid, but quickly took the lead. Goff, who picked up one win at the speedway last season, was the class of the field in the feature as he cruised to the feature win to end Mathew Olson’s two-race win streak. 
 Rob VanMil of Barnesville, Minn., Rick Schulz of Horace, N.D., and Tim Compson of Valley City, N.D., put on a show during the IMCA stock car feature. The three veteran drivers battled back and forth for the race lead nearly all race long, but at the checkers, VanMil was able to take the win. With the win, VanMil remains undefeated at the speedway in the stock car division with a perfect three wins in three races. VanMil also picked up the win Thursday night at Norman County Raceway.

The Harlem drug kingpin whose life became the basis for the 2007 movie “American Gangster” has died. Frank Lucas was 88.

 NEW YORK 
 Frank Lucas, the former Harlem drug kingpin whose life and lore inspired the 2007 movie ""American Gangster,"" has died, a relative said Friday. 
 Lucas, who was 88, died Thursday in New Jersey, nephew Aldwan Lassiter said. Lucas had been in declining health, according to his former lawyer. 
 Raised in North Carolina, Lucas climbed the ranks of crime in Harlem in the 1960s and '70s, becoming a major drug dealer known for supplying huge amounts of particularly potent heroin. 
 He said it netted him millions, and authorities seized over $500,000 in cash when they raided his house in Teaneck, New Jersey, in 1975.  He was convicted and sentenced to decades in prison, but he turned informant and was released after about five years.

 Lucas was quickly arrested again for drug dealing, on a much smaller scale. He served seven more years, getting out again in 1991. 
 Lucas' story became the basis for the Ridley Scott-directed ""American Gangster,"" starring Denzel Washington as Lucas and Russell Crowe as Richard ""Richie"" Roberts, a composite of various detectives and prosecutors. The real-life Roberts is a former prosecutor who helped convict Lucas but later became his lawyer and friend, even godfather to Lucas' son. 
 Lucas was a fixture on the film set, giving Washington advice on such details as how he carried his gun. 
 The movie got awards buzz but also brought scrutiny of claims in Lucas' legend, particularly a portrayal of him smuggling drugs in U.S. soldiers' caskets during the Vietnam War. 
 A co-author of a book about Lucas, Ron Chepesiuk, said he never had any evidence or court records to substantiate the so-called ""cadaver connection."" Lucas, however, continued to say in 2008 that he'd transported heroin via coffin — but only once. 
 The film's assertion that Lucas rooted out a heap of law enforcement corruption also was called into question, and a group of former federal drug enforcement agents claimed in a lawsuit that the movie grossly misrepresented the truth and defamed them. That lawsuit was tossed out. 
 As for Lucas' unquestioned role in supplying heroin that killed some users, he told The Associated Press in 2007 that he regretted it. 
 ""I did some terrible things. I'm awfully sorry that I did them. I really am,"" he said. 
 Lucas, who lived in Newark in recent years, had another brush with the law in 2012: He pleaded guilty to lying to try cashing in twice on a $17,000 federal disability benefit check. Lucas, who came to court in a wheelchair, was sentenced to five years' probation, with prosecutors saying they agreed to it because of his poor health and advanced age. 
 Roberts told NJ.com on Friday that Lucas' health was failing when the two spoke a few weeks ago.",1

 NEW YORK -- Cardi B, dressed in a hot pink pantsuit and sporting long, sparkling pink fingernails, briefly appeared in court in New York City Friday in connection with a melee inside a strip club. 
 The Grammy-winner rapper is charged with ordering an attack on two bartenders at the Queens club Angels, and prosecutors revealed the case is now before a grand jury. 
 Cardi B is accused of throwing bottles and chairs at the bartenders after accusing them of having sex with her husband, and the grand jury is an indication she could be facing upgraded charges after rejecting a plea deal. 
 The hip hop superstar refused the deal , which would have given her a conditional discharge if she pleaded guilty to assault. She informed the judge Friday that she would not be testifying. 
 She has been charged with two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and one of assault. 
 The 26-year-old rapper, whose real name Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, dropped a new single at midnight called ""Press"" that appears to reference her court battles and her fights with the media. 
 The strip club incident happened just weeks after she was involved in a dispute with fellow rapper Nicki Minaj at a New York Fashion Week party.

 The Virginia Beach Police Department had scheduled a free community workshop for Saturday morning on what to do during mass shootings. About 24 hours before the class, a disgruntled employee opened fire in a city building, killing 12 people, police said. 
 At least 36 people intended to attend the Active Threat Citizen Defense session, according to the department's Facebook page. The workshop has since been canceled, police said early Saturday. 
 The class was planned days before the shooting and highlighted the need to prepare for potential active threat situations. 
 ""Having to face an armed individual with bad intentions is every person's worst nightmare,"" the class description said. ""You can't stop evil, you can only respond to it. The aggressor's actions are not your fault; failure to plan and failure to train, is."" 
 The class was aimed at enhancing preparedness for citizens to ""rise to the occasion"" during such situations. 
 The teachings would have included recognizing hostile situations, utilizing common items for defense and a ""no-skills needed"" maneuver to combat a gunman.

 The excess load of utility wires was stated as one of the reasons behind last year's Gokhale bridge collapse. Almost a year after that, the BMC plans to take precautionary measures so that the incident is not repeated. Civic chief Praveen Pardeshi has instructed the bridges department to check the load of wires on bridges and shift them accordingly. 
 Western Railway had earlier written to the civic body asking them to consider limiting the weight of utility cables on bridges that cross over railway lines.

 The search for little Maleah Davis may be over. Human remains were found in Arkansas Friday, and police think they may be the missing Houston 4-year-old , per the New York Daily News .

Quanell X, an activist who has helped Maleah's mother, tells KTRK that suspect Derion Vence, the ex-fiance of Maleah's mother, confessed to killing Maleah and told him where the body was when Quanell visited him in jail on Friday. 
 ""All I can say is he told me it was an accident, and that she is dead and where he dumped her body,"" Quanell told reporters. 
 ""He said he pulled over in Arkansas, got out of the car, walked off the side of the road, and dumped her body off the side of the road."" Hempstead County Sheriff James Singleton tells KTAL that road workers found a black garbage bag, said to contain bones and blood and with a foul stench, on the side of a road in Fulton. 
 Singleton says the bag had actually been found earlier in the week, but the road crew initially thought it contained the body of a dead animal, per the Houston Chronicle . 
 ""It might be Maleah but we can't be certain,"" Houston Police Commander Michael Skillern says. The remains have been flown back to Texas and will be tested. 
 ""If it's not Maleah, it's somebody's child,"" Finner says.

 FROM MY HEART - Barbara Gonzalez-Ventura (The Philippine Star) - June 2, 2019 - 12:00am 
 Life is not always happy but you must always think about what will make you happy and always work towards that. 
 In the blink of an eye we are almost halfway through the year. At the end of this month 2019 will be halfway over. Recently I spent some time with our grandchildren. Charming little Zari celebrated her fourth birthday in a lovely red dress. She loved the ribbons on her gifts, wove them on the backs of chairs. She said they would get “yonging.” It took me a bit to figure out she meant “longing,” the ribbons would get longer as she wove. What an enviable imagination she has! 
 She showed me her birthday cake, tried to poke her chubby finger into it. She loved her gifts, knew exactly what they were. Then she turned quiet, engrossed in playing with her new toys. 
 Her much older sister Iva, who is 13, sat and talked with me about time and what it meant at her age. When she was in the lower grades, time absolutely crawled. It took so long to have anything happen. Now she was in the upper grades and time still crawled but a little bit faster. Maybe time toddles, walks a little unsteadily, slowly, but interestingly. 
 I am amused. Time was magical at Zari’s age. Everything was joyful. We created our own words. Everyone found us so cute.  Then we grew a little up. 
 Ah, Iva, I wanted to say, just enjoy every day no matter how slowly. One day you will grow old like me. When you get old you realize that time actually flies like jets. When you are 13 it still goes slowly. You are at an awkward stage. The adult in you that has been asleep is just beginning to stir. You are full of curiosity that you must withhold. You compose songs or write poems to express the confusion in you, that’s just beginning to unravel. Sometimes you sit and think and find yourself crying for no reason. Other times you giggle by yourself. That’s what it feels like to start growing up. Look at it this way: until you die, you are in the process of becoming. 
 When you become a full-fledged teenager, enjoy the parties. I used to dance the boogie in four-inch high heels until past midnight. Then I would wake up at two in the afternoon without aches or pains, feeling wonderful. I would call up my girlfriends and gossip about the party last night and when the sun began to set, the boys would begin to call and I would be on the phone for hours. Those years were fun. I should not have married at 18. I should have allowed myself to have fun until I dropped. 
 But then marriage came along as it inevitably comes along. I had children. First we were very happy, then we were not as the children began to grow up and demand more and more of our time and attention. Husband and wife began to focus on the children and less on each other. 
 Now that I am 74 I watch people in public places. Most of those who have grown-up children don’t seem close to each other, don’t seem happy with each other. They sort of drag along, weighed down by responsibility. The men are worried about their children’s schooling, their household expenses, their car and insurance payments. The women are worried about how to discipline the children. They are going through the work portion of marriage, when they have to earn enough money to provide well for their families. 
 I remember that portion of my life too, though when I got there I had no more husband. Basically I preferred to work and be independent and make decisions by myself than have to put up with a husband who was so successful he didn’t come home early anymore and had a lot of women on the side. I realized I did not like the lifestyle he gave us even if it came with a lovely house, a big garden and swimming pool. You might go through that, too. You will have to weigh what you like and what you don’t like in your life and you will have to decide how you want to live. That’s the hardest part of life but that’s something we all have to learn to do. We have to learn to decide for ourselves. What will make us happy? It sounds easy but it really is very hard to do. 
 The best thing we can do is live for the day. Live it when it is magical like Zari does. Live it when it toddles, like you in your early teens. Enjoy it when you’re partying. All this is just preparation. When real life happens, when you have to decide so many times, don’t forget about your happiness. Life is not always happy but you must always think about what will make you happy and always work towards that.

 TORONTO — Golden State star Kevin Durant is going to miss Game 2 of the NBA Finals, and Andre Iguodala’s health is of at least mild concern to the two-time defending champion Warriors as well. 
 Iguodala, the 2015 NBA Finals MVP, had an MRI on Friday on his left leg after he was hurt late in Game 1 of the title-series opener against the Toronto Raptors. Durant, the finals MVP in 2017 and 2018 who has been dealing with a strained calf, was ruled out by Warriors coach Steve Kerr in an expected move. 
 “Kevin’s not going to play Sunday,” Kerr said. “I guess we’ve been holding out hope, but might as well say it now. ... It’s near-impossible for him to play on Sunday.”

 Toronto took Game 1 and will host Game 2 on Sunday night. Iguodala expects to play, and the Warriors said his MRI came back clean. 
 “He seems to be doing well. ... I talked to him and he said he felt pretty good,” Kerr said. 
 Iguodala scored with just under two minutes left in Game 1, his left leg flaring out a bit as he leaped to take that shot from the middle of the lane. He immediately grabbed the back of the leg in the hamstring area after landing, clapped his hands while grimacing and hobbled down to the other end. 
 The Warriors subbed him out not long afterward, and he didn’t return. 
 Iguodala started and played 29 minutes in Game 1, finishing with six points, six rebounds and seven assists. He was slowed in the Western Conference finals by a problem with his left calf, and he missed the clinching Game 4 of that series. 
 Kerr said the team isn’t going to rush Durant’s return. The fear is that if he comes back before the calf is sound even the slightest tweak would mean his season is over. 
 Durant hasn’t played since he was hurt in Game 5 of the West semifinals against Houston. 
 “The thinking is when he’s ready to play, he’ll play,” Kerr said. 
 Durant traveled with the team to Toronto, wanting to be with his teammates for the start of the finals and needing to work with the Warriors’ medical staff. 
 “He’s still progressing,” Kerr said.

86929,"These Democratic billionaires could help shape the 2020 election 
 Spending helped Dems win back House 
 By: 
 Posted: Jun 01, 2019 06:52 PM EDT 
 Updated: Jun 01, 2019 06:52 PM EDT 
 England bans plastic items from April 2020 
 A small cluster of Democrats, led by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, donated a combined $226 million to outside groups in the 2018 midterms for Congress, or nearly $1 out of every $5 spent by outside groups in those elections. 
 The spending helped Democrats win back the House. Now, some of these mega-donors -- including the billionaire pro-impeachment activist Tom Steyer -- are poised to help shape the 2020 races for the presidency and Congress. 
 Here's a glance at the Democrats' five biggest donors and the amounts they donated to outside groups at the federal level in the 2018 election cycle, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics: 
  
  
 Amount donated to outside groups in 2018: $95 million 
 The former New York City mayor -- first elected as a Republican -- joined the Democratic Party in 2018 to do battle against President Donald Trump and his policies. The billionaire decided against his own presidential bid in 2020, but the millions he dedicated to Democrats in 2018 helped the party seize control of the House in the midterms. 
 In an op-ed this year announcing his decision against seeking the presidency, Bloomberg said he plans to his plow money and energy into the issues that have long animated him -- including expanding renewable energy as a way to combat climate change, promoting gun safety and education reform. 
 But Bloomberg, whose wealth is estimated at more than $54 billion by Forbes, also is expected invest heavily to help build the organizational and technical infrastructure to aid the Democrats' eventual White House nominee. 
 His aides did not respond to interview requests. Bloomberg himself is speaking out often about Trump's policies, penning an op-ed this week that called Trump's plans to impose a 5% tariffs on goods from Mexico over immigration ""radical and disturbing."" Bloomberg called on Congress to rein in Trump's power to set trade policy. 
  
  
 Amount donated: $72.4 million 
 Steyer, a billionaire hedge-fund founder, is an unabashed progressive who made his first big splash in national Democratic politics in 2014 with a multimillion-dollar effort to put climate change at the center of the political debate. 
 In recent years, he's also worked to make himself the face of the anti-Trump resistance with a barrage of television commercials calling for Trump's impeachment. 
 Along the way, he's built a massive political organization. 
 More than eight million people, for instance, have signed on to his impeachment campaign, giving Steyer and his aides a formidable email list of like-minded voters. And his political groups employed 750 during the 2018 midterms with operations on 420 college campuses to drive youth turnout. 
 ""We were the largest grassroots organization in the United States in 2018,"" Steyer recently told CNN. ""We'll definitely be doing that work in 2020."" 
 Steyer, who opted against his own presidential bid in 2020, said climate change and impeachment likely will be big factors in determining which Democratic candidates receive his support in 2020. He called impeachment ""the major issue facing the United States of America on a real-time basis."" 
 ""It's going to be very hard to understand how we could support somebody who tries to duck"" the impeachment question, Steyer said in the interview. 
  
  
 Amount donated: $22.4 million 
 The billionaire hedge-fund manager, who rarely grants interviews, has been one of the Democratic Party's biggest financial backers in recent elections. In the midterms, Susman donated nearly $8.5 million to Priorities USA Action, the primary Democratic outside group that's working to build the party's digital infrastructure to battle Trump. 
 Sussman, the founder of Connecticut-based Paloma Partners, also gave nearly $10 million to the main party super PACs working to elect Democrats to the House and Senate. 
 One of his goals, Sussman says: helping elect candidates who will get big money out of politics. 
 ""It's very odd to be giving millions when your objective is to actually get the money out of politics,"" Susman told The Washington Post in a rare 2016 interview . ""I am a very strong supporter of publicly financed campaigns."" 
 He did not respond to an interview request. 
  
  
 Amount donated: $20.1 million 
 The couple has supported some of the biggest outside groups in Democratic politics during the midterms. 
 James Simons, for instance, donated $10 million to a single group, the House Majority PAC, which worked to help the party win control of the chamber in 2018. He's an MIT-educated mathematician, who founded Renaissance Technologies, a New York hedge fund. 
 Simons -- worth more than $21 billion, according to Forbes -- stepped away from day-to-day management of the fund in 2009. Their aides did not respond to interview requests. 
  
  
 Amount donated: $16.7 million 
 The hedge-fund tycoon is among the best-known Democratic donors in the country. He broke into national politics in 2004 when he spent millions of his fortune in a failed attempt to deny President George W. Bush a second term. 
 Around the world, the Hungarian-born billionaire is known for sending billions of his own money into liberal, Democratic causes. He's vilified on both sides of the Atlantic by conservative politicians. 
 One baseless claim that circulated in the run-up to last year's midterm elections sought link Soros to a migrant caravan making its way to the United States' southern border. 
 Soros donated nearly $10 million in the 2016 campaign to a super PAC supporting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. In the 2018 midterms, he donated to an array of major Democratic groups, including $5 million to Win Justice, a collaboration between Planned Parenthood Voters, the Service Employees International Union and other liberal groups that mobilized people of color, women and young people to vote in the midterms. 
 ""We are likely sitting out the primary,"" his political adviser Michael Vachon told CNN in an email earlier this year, when asked about the 2020 White House race.",1

 US now seeking social media details from all visa applicants 
 The change, which was proposed in March 2018, is expected to affect about 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States each year. 
 Author: Associated Press 
 Published: 1:39 PM CDT June 1, 2019 
 Updated: 1:39 PM CDT June 1, 2019 
 The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers. It's a vast expansion of the Trump administration's enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors. 
 In a move that's just taken effect after approval of the revised application forms, the department says it has updated its immigrant and nonimmigrant visa forms to request the additional information, including ""social media identifiers,"" from almost all U.S. applicants. 
 The change, which was proposed in March 2018, is expected to affect about 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States each year. 
 ""National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications, and every prospective traveler and immigrant to the United States undergoes extensive security screening,"" the department said. ""We are constantly working to find mechanisms to improve our screening processes to protect U.S. citizens, while supporting legitimate travel to the United States."" 
 Social media, email and phone number histories had only been sought in the past from applicants who were identified for extra scrutiny, such as people who'd traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations. An estimated 65,000 applicants per year had fallen into that category. 
 The department says collecting the additional information from more applicants ""will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity."" 
 The new rules apply to virtually all applicants for immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. When it filed its initial notice to make the change, the department estimated it would affect 710,000 immigrant visa applicants and 14 million nonimmigrant visa applicants, including those who want to come to the U.S. for business or education. 
 The new visa application forms list a number of social media platforms and require the applicant to provide any account names they may have had on them over the previous five years. They also give applicants the option to volunteer information about social media accounts on platforms not listed on the form. 
 In addition to their social media histories, visa applicants are now asked for five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, international travel and deportation status, as well as whether any family members have been involved in terrorist activities. 
 Only applicants for certain diplomatic and official visa types are exempted from the requirements.",1

 Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Email 
 This prolific insider is also a skilled inventor who owned an amazing company based on ZeroPointEnergy for 5 years. As you can imagine, that did not go over too well with those who prefer a muted status quo. And Emery has faced numerous challenges. 
 By Anne 
 He’s been severely criticized, suppressed, harassed, and threatened for the work he has tried to bring forward. Yet, he has still managed to keep his wits about him and share his great wealth of knowledge. 
 Although we have added him here on True Disclosure as a “whistleblower” and others have referred to him as “Secret Space Program whistleblower”, the title “insider” is more appropriate and that is what Emery prefers as well: 
 A lot of you did not know I was part of these programs. I don’t necessarily call it the Secret Space Program – that’s kinda a pop culture thing. I’m definitely an insider and I’m here to tell the story and I’m one of the most highly credentialed insiders based on the documents I’ve presented to major organizations. 
 Emery Smith 
 And in the following interview, he discusses the importance of using his inventions to help others and heal the planet. He shares his struggles and his joys; as well as some tidbits regarding fascinating new  free energy technology and the capacity to clean up massive toxic nuclear messes like Fukushima . 
 It’s so refreshing to have an insider on the frontlines with such expanded awareness and compassion for others: 
 All my inventions only help Gaia, the earth, and only helps the animals and beings on the planet, and the humans as well. Let’s do something that everyone can benefit from… 
 Emery Smith 
 This is an excellent interview with a lot of heart. Huge thanks to Kosta at ETLetsTalk.com. 
 Emery has sacrificed friends, family, finances, his health and more to reveal insider secrets from his life in Deep Projects dealing with Extra-terrestrials, Underground Bases, amazing medical technologies, free energy and much more. His life has been threatened repeatedly because he has been speaking out. But he is determined to reveal what he learned first-hand form his years in these projects. The public needs to know!

 MANHATTAN, Kan. 
 A three-day Kansas country music festival scheduled for June has moved from a state park outside Manhattan to the Topeka area because of concerns about flooding. 
 The Country Stampede announced its move Friday. Organizers said they were unsure of the safety of its original location at Tuttle Creek State Park because of recent severe weather. 
 The festival will be held at Heartland Park, a motorsports park south of Topeka. The dates of the festival remain June 20-22. 
 Areas across the state have seen flooding because of heavy rains in recent weeks. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the Tuttle Creek Lake is close to full and it is releasing 27,500 cubic feet of water per second to keep water levels manageable.

57848,"North of border, Warriors enter new territory: 1-0 deficit 
 'Experience helps': Warriors trail Raptors 1-0 in finals, and now face new challenge. 
 Friday, May 31st 2019, 4:01 PM EDT 
 Updated: 
 Saturday, June 1st 2019, 8:52 AM EDT 
 By TIM REYNOLDS 
 AP Basketball Writer 
 TORONTO (AP) - Steve Kerr has seen a little of almost everything during his wildly successful five-year run as coach of the Golden State Warriors. 
 This, however, is something new. 
 AlertMe 
 For the first time, Kerr and the Warriors are staring at a 1-0 deficit in the NBA Finals. They've trailed in series before, faced plenty of adverse moments along the way, but this is the newest challenge for a franchise trying to join the short list of clubs that have won three consecutive championships. 
 ""The experience helps,"" Kerr said Friday, a day after the Toronto Raptors struck first. ""Winning multiple championships helps because you have seen it all. There's also just the knowledge that you've been here before. You've been down. We have been up 3-1 and lost a series. We have been down 3-1 and won a series. Everything in between. So nothing is going to catch these guys off-guard."" 
 That's his hope, anyway. 
 There was a clear air of confidence from the Warriors even in the very first moments after the loss Thursday night. They knew they didn't play particularly well, and lost by only nine. They trailed most of the way, yet still were within striking distance plenty of times. They seemed far from rattled. 
 ""No matter what, our sights were coming in that it's a long series,"" Warriors star Stephen Curry said. ""And Game 2 is an opportunity for us to right the wrongs and get a big win and go back home."" 
 No one needs to explain to the Warriors that a win on Sunday completely shifts the narrative. 
 And even though the axiom has always been that Game 1 winners usually go on to win the series - and that is still the case - it seems that a 1-0 deficit isn't as daunting to teams as it once might have been. 
 Since the league went to the 16-team format for the 1984 postseason, Game 1 winners have never been as vulnerable as they have seemed to be this year. In the 14 series this year that preceded the NBA Finals, six Game 1 winners wound up losing their series. That's never happened before in this format. 
 In the 2010s, Game 1 winners have gone on to lose a series 31% of the time. In the 2000s, it was 25%; in the 1990s, 15%. 
 ""As soon as you lose a game, it will be on the crawl that now we only have a 19.7% chance of winning the series. Then if we win (Sunday) we'll have a 42.7% chance of not losing the series,"" said Kerr, tongue firmly planted in cheek. ""This stuff is what it is. You lose a game, you come back and you try to win."" 
 Kerr's stance is clear: A simpler approach - study film, find ways to get better, apply them Sunday - is best. 
 On the other hand, Golden State hadn't lost a Game 1 this season. Or the season before that. Or the season before that. 
 The last time the Warriors woke up and were down 1-0 in a series was the Western Conference finals in 2016 - against Kevin Durant and Oklahoma City. The Warriors responded with a blowout win in Game 2 and went on to prevail in seven games. 
 ""You never lose that experience,"" Warriors forward Draymond Green said. ""You can always look back on it and it's more about how you felt, what was your mindset then. But it's impossible to be the same because it's completely different teams. And although some of us may have that experience, others on our team have not had that experience."" 
 It bears noting that the Raptors know a 1-0 series lead doesn't mean much. 
 Orlando had one of those against Toronto in the first round, and lost in five games. 
 Milwaukee had one of those against Toronto in the Eastern Conference finals - 2-0, actually - and lost in six games. 
 ""We've tried to (have) a conscious thought process of not really caring what the score of the series is,"" Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. ""I think we know that the games are really hard. We know that after a win, the team that gets beat gets really determined. They try to fix things. They mostly play a lot harder and more physical and all those kind of things."" 
 The challenge for his team is to do the same. That process started with a long film session Friday, and there was much to clean up. 
 ""There was plenty on there that we need to do better if we want to win another game in this series,"" Nurse said.

 Prancing and screeching across the stage in a neon green suit and his new blond, bowl-cut wig, Tyler, the Creator stole the show on Gov Ball 2019’s inaugural night. Without special guests or a backing band, the ever-eccentric rapper captivated the crowd with songs from his just-released new album, “IGOR,” as well as fan favorites from his deep catalog. Although “IGOR” has only been out for a couple of weeks, the audience knew many of the lyrics and shouted along fervently — to the heartfelt appreciation of the seemingly surprised Tyler, who also served as his own hype man. 
 Opening his set with the ominous buzzy synth and syncopated breakbeat of “Igor’s Theme,” Tyler powered through several songs from the new album at a feverish pace, which jolted the crowd even without the album’s long list of celebrity collaborators: “I Think” (not featuring Solange, as it does on the album) and “New Magic Wand” (ditto Santigold). “Who would’ve thought that an album about your heart being broke would be this f—in’ turnt up?” he asked the crowd. “This the No. 1 album in the world right now!”

 The 2019 Governors Ball by the Numbers 
 He slowed down the pace for the heartfelt “Puppet,” which he delivered sitting down, before changing into his usual outfit of shorts, a short-sleeved button-down shirt and a cap to perform some “Flower Boy” and “Wolf” — then it was back to “IGOR.” “Can we wild out for a bit?” he asked rhetorically before plunging into “What’s Good” and eventually the hit “Earfquake.” 
 “I’m really excited,” he said, introducing the latter track. “I wrote this song, and I’m like ‘I’m gonna write my version of a goddamn pop hit.’ And it’s getting there, slowly but surely — so every person in here that sing along, just know you are f—in’ appreciated.” 
 Earlier in the evening, Lil Wayne — dripping in Gucci and wearing a large-brimmed white hat that could’ve easily been mistaken for a sombrero —  took the predominantly teenage Gov Ball audience back to the late aughts and early 2010s. But the crowd knew his catalog and responded with a frenzy to “Tha Carter III” and “IV” tracks like “Mr. Carter,” “6 Foot 7 Foot,” “A Milli,” “Mrs. Officer,” and crowd-favorite “Lollipop.” “I used to do these things called mixtapes, you heard of ’em?” he joked, before performing “Rollin’” from 2011’s “Sorry 4 the Wait.”

 The set also included some more contemporary material, like his verses from Chance the Rapper’s “No Problem” and French Montana’s “Pop That,” as well as “Tha Carter V” cuts like “Uproar” and “Don’t Cry” — his tribute to the late XXXTentacion, who posthumously provided its hook. Featuring both a live band and his DJ, the combination worked exceedingly well on some songs but fell flat on others, occasionally drowning out the rapper’s ever-intricate wordplay. 
 Brockhampton brought the biggest production of the day, beginning their set with a flight suit-clad, brooding Bearface singing “Summer” on a moving platform extended above the audience by a crane. A tarped structure on stage was then revealed to be a golden airplane, held up by a massive blue hand, containing Kevin Abstract and the other crew members — who all busted out rapping “Boogie.” “You are now watching the greatest boy band in the mother—in’ world!” Kevin reminded fans more than once throughout the show.

 Other standout sets from day one of Governors Ball included a laid-back, soulful display from in-the-pocket contemporary funk kingpins The Internet as well as the outspoken and charismatic Jessie Reyez, who touched on issues like immigration and the #MeToo movement between songs. “Something like over five, six years ago, when I was singing for people and begging people to hear my sh–, I met this producer,” she shared before performing her #MeToo anthem, “Gatekeeper.” “I was so f—in’ happy, man, I prayed in the bathroom… and I came back out and I was like, ‘alright, I’ma sing for this dude,’ and I sang for him — and I was lit! And then he looks at me and he goes, ‘Yeah Jessie, you can sing, but if you want to succeed, you need to suck d— for a deal.’” Her response to him and all doubters? “I like to tell ’em to suck my d—.”

9926,"East County superintendent placed on leave amid fraud investigation

 The Dehesa School District Board voted 4-0 Friday afternoon to place their superintendent on paid administrative leave amid a fraud investigation. 
 EL CAJON, Calif. (KGTV) — The Dehesa School District Board voted 4-0 Friday afternoon to place their superintendent on paid administrative leave amid a fraud investigation. 
 Earlier this week, the San Diego District Attorney’s Office charged Superintendent Nancy Hauer with one count of misappropriating public funds. 
 She was one of 11 people charged in a statewide scheme, in which the DA says two men siphoned more than $50 million in state money through a network of 19 charter schools. 
 “The defendants sought out small school districts with limited experience in oversight and proposed they authorize online charter schools to earn additional public funds in the form of oversight fees,” the DA’s Office wrote in a summary of the charges. 
 At Friday’s special Dehesa School District Board meeting, the board spent an hour and a half in closed session with legal counsel discussing Hauer’s employment. 
 Board President, Cindy White refused an interview with 10News. 
 On the dais, Board Vice President Karl Backer told the audience, “we have initiated new legal council to peel apart the charter operations to make sure sound practices and legal compliance is met.”

 Dodgers rip 4 HRs, beat Phillies 6-3 in matchup of NL's best

 Back to Gallery 
 LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Dodgers ended the month of May with a 19-7 record and their stellar play is bringing back memories of 2017. 
 That's when they won a major league-best 104 games and advanced to their first World Series since 1988. 
 ""Kind of clicking on all cylinders,"" Corey Seager said. ""You don't have to be the guy. Everybody understands that."" 
 The Dodgers proved it Friday night. 
 Max Muncy, Joc Pederson, Seager and Enriquè Hernàndez homered, powering Los Angeles to a 6-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in the opener of a series matching the National League's best teams. 
 The West-leading Dodgers improved to a major league-best 23-7 at home and have won 11 of their last 15 at Chavez Ravine against the East-leading Phillies. 
 The Dodgers' 39 victories lead the NL and they enter June 20 games over .500 for the first time since June 1978. 
 ""If we get a few things tightened up, we'll be even better,"" said bench coach Bob Geren, who ran the team in place of manager Dave Roberts. 
 The Dodgers rapped out 12 hits while limiting the Phillies to five, two of which came in the ninth. 
 ""Sucks to lose,"" Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said. ""At the same time we understand that in order for us to beat clubs like this we have to play our best baseball and we didn't do that."" 
 Kenta Maeda (7-2) allowed two runs and three hits in six innings and won his fourth straight start and first over Philadelphia in his career. The right-hander struck out six and walked none. 
 Kenley Jansen earned his 17th save, striking out pinch-hitter Andrew Knapp in the ninth, the only batter he faced. 
 Muncy and Seager belted two-run shots and Pederson had a solo homer off Jake Arrieta (5-5), who gave up five runs and 10 hits in five innings. The right-hander struck out three and walked one in the ballpark where Arrieta pitched his first career no-hitter in 2015 with the Cubs. 
 ""I had a chance to navigate through the lineup, pitch around some situations, just didn't do a very good job,"" Arrieta said. ""Just wasn't very sharp with the slider, change up or the curveball. They were able to eliminate too many pitches."" 
 Philadelphia's Bryce Harper, Andrew McCutchen and Rhys Hoskins combined to go 2 for 12. Harper came in batting .346 in his previous 13 games. 
 Muncy's 20th homer gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead and scored Pederson, who singled leading off the third. 
 McCutchen's homer leading off the fourth made it 2-1. 
 The Phillies tied the game 2-all in the fifth on Arrieta's RBI single. 
 Pederson led off the bottom of the fifth with his 17th homer, the first of four consecutive hits given up by Arrieta. Muncy followed with a single before he scored on Seager's two-run shot that landed in the corner of the right field pavilion, making it 5-2. 
 Cody Bellinger followed with a single before Arrieta got three straight outs to end the inning. 
 Hernàndez extended the Dodgers' lead to 6-2 with a solo homer on the first pitch from Juan Nicasio in the seventh. 
 TRAINER'S ROOM 
 Phillies: RHP Zach Eflin went on the IL with mid-back tightness and will miss his scheduled start Saturday. He's not expected to be out long. ... RHP Victor Arano (right elbow) is 2-3 months from returning after having his elbow scoped Tuesday. 
 Dodgers: 3B Justin Turner (right hamstring tightness) missed his second straight game, although he worked out on the field during batting practice. 
 MISSING SKIPPER 
 Roberts missed the game to attend his son's high school graduation. Cole Roberts played shortstop and second base at private Santa Fe Christian School in Solana Beach, north of San Diego. He has committed to Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles. The elder Roberts also celebrated his 47th birthday Friday. 
 SHORTEST HOMER 
 Seager's homer — his fifth in May after just two in the first two months of the season — was the shortest of the Dodgers' four at 371 feet. That trailed Pederson (445), Hernàndez (432) and Muncy (394). ""They all count,"" Seager said. ""I'm feeling better at the plate."" 
 FANS IN THE STANDS 
 The announced attendance of 54,307 was the largest regular-season crowd at Dodger Stadium since 2012 and the team's sixth sellout of the season. 
 UP NEXT 
 Phillies: They had yet to name a starter for Saturday night after putting RH Zach Eflin on the IL with mid-back tightness. 
 Dodgers: LH Clayton Kershaw (5-0, 3.46) will be facing Harper, who is 2 for 21 with 13 strikeouts against him.

 Employing special characters for the files, especially if you are planning to use on the web, can lead to various issues. ManageNameExt is a minimalist yet very efficient OS X app that can deal with basic file renaming tasks. 
 Quickly define custom renaming patterns for your files 
 The ManageNameExt user interface is represented by a plain window where, in the top area, you can see the list of imported files and folders that will be processed, while the bottom region is reserved for the editing tools. 
 Within the ManageNameExt main window, you can choose to use lower cases, upper cases, or title cases for the file names, or decide to keep them unchanged. At the same time, you can replace individual characters with others, add a prefix or a suffix. 
 Moreover, you can modify the file’s modification date and time, or prepare it for the web. When preparing files for the web, ManageNameExt applies the rules defined in the Preferences window: it will replace certain characters with others, and make sure the files use only authorized symbols. 
 Effortlessly manipulate the file’s extension name 
 Noteworthy is that ManageNameExt can also deal with cleaning up the file’s extension names. You can choose to add a particular extension (manually or automatically), to remove it completely, or to only hide it. 
 At the same time, you can quickly switch them to lower case, upper case, or title case formatting. ManageNameExt automatically operates the changes and allows you to preview the results, but to complete the procedure, you must press the “Process” button placed in the bottom right corner of the main window. 
 Batch rename file names, prepare them for the web, or change the extension’s formatting 
 ManageNameExt offers you the necessary tools for handling entire folders but also individual files at the same time, and create a coherent naming pattern for your files. In addition, you can also prepare them for the web, and choose to use the same formatting for the file’s extension.

 A latter-day Lawrence of Arabia emerges as dark horse for May's job

 London: Pete Wellock, a retired housing consultant, had just popped out to pick up some groceries last week when he found himself face to face with Rory Stewart, a gangly, animated and very earnest Cabinet minister.

 Stewart, who has begun a darkest-of-dark-horses campaign to succeed Theresa May as prime minister, has spent the last week travelling the country trying to engage members of the public on Brexit, broadcasting these encounters in a stream of slightly awkward, DIY-style dispatches on social media. 
 Britons, not a people known for chatting up strangers, find these hilarious, and have responded on Twitter with good-natured mockery, joking that Stewart is ""in your fridge for the next hour,"" or ""sliding out from under your bed"" or ""calling me from a series of blocked numbers."" 
 Somewhere amid all that banter, Stewart has hijacked the Conservative Party leadership campaign with a surprising argument: Britain must reapply its energy to compromise, between its own angry factions and with Europe. 
 Advertisement 
 This is a frontal challenge to the Tories. 
 The front-runner for the post, Boris Johnson, has vowed to exit the European Union on October 31, even if no agreement is in place.

 This promise is tailored to a small audience of Tory hard-liners: It is a quirk of Britain's democracy that May's replacement will be selected not through primaries but by around 120,000 Conservative Party activists, a group that is older, whiter, more male and more adamant about leaving Europe than the general public. 
 In a survey this year, two-thirds of party members said they preferred a no-deal exit to May's withdrawal agreement. 
 Stewart, a former environment minister and prisons minister, is trying to blow up that policy, not by warning of the damage it would do, as a string of leaders have for the last three years, but by arguing that it is simply a practical impossibility.

 ""The battle is to explain to people that 'no deal' is a phantasm,"" Stewart said. ""It's nothing. It's an absence. It's a failure to reach a destination. It sounds fine, but it's not going to get through Parliament."" 
 His voice comes as a welcome surprise at an angry moment in Britain. He speaks calmly of reconciliation, seemingly impervious to the rancor that has divided the country, like Ferdinand the Bull. 
 ""The key word that we need to get back to,"" he told the BBC's Question Time on Thursday, ""a word that is so powerful, and nobody every uses in politics, is the word 'love.'"" 
 Stewart, 46, is posh, eccentric and clever, precisely, as one journalist wrote this week, the sort of oddball Britons love. 
 Stewart, 46, is posh, eccentric and clever, precisely, as one journalist wrote this week, the sort of oddball Britons love. 
 The son of a senior British intelligence officer, he attended Eton and Oxford, and served briefly as a tutor to Princes William and Harry before entering the diplomatic service. He set that aside to walk 6000 miles (10,000k) alone across Iran, Pakistan and part of Afghanistan, the basis for an acclaimed book, The Places in Between. After the coalition invasion of Iraq, he served for a time as deputy governor of a region in the country's south. 
 In 2010, he entered Parliament, to the surprise of many of his friends and family. He was greeted there, wonderingly, as a latter-day Lawrence of Arabia, an odd fit in a Conservative Party sliding toward populism. 
 As a backbencher, he spoke eloquently of his sympathy for, and rejection of, the Scottish independence movement. At one point, he delivered a lengthy address on hedgehogs, referencing Aristotle, Richard III, Sumerian cylinder seals, Mrs Tiggy-Winkle and Romany homeopathy. 
 Over the last week, his goofy internet campaign has won him a new and giddy following. 
 As he strode through London around 9m on his way to his last interview one day last week, office workers in their 20s and 30s shouted in delight. ""Rory, I love you! You're one of my favorite people on Twitter!"" cried out a woman in red. 
 ""I'm digging what you're doing,"" said a man in a suit. 
 Jessica Elgot, who covers politics for The Guardian, noted that on her daily commute, she had seen people watching videos of Stewart on their mobile phones. 
 ""What an odd time we live in,"" she marvelled. 
 Stewart has used the moment cannily, hamming it up. He posted a clip of himself chatting with a constituent in Barking, captioned, ""Practicing my now — rather rusty — Dari."" 
 Even his obligatory early-life drug-use confession — smoking opium at an Iranian wedding while trekking alone through the hinterlands of Asia — had a strong whiff of the 19th-century warrior-poet. On Thursday, he told Sky News he regretted it. 
 ""I made a stupid mistake,"" he said. ""Somebody passed round this pipe and I smoked it. I shouldn't have done it. I was wrong."" 
 Still, he was making little headway among Tories. As of Friday, according to the website Conservative Home, only three members of Parliament had declared support for him as party leader, compared with nearly 30 for front-runners like Johnson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. 
 Stewart has said he thinks he could muster 25, but acknowledged that, when he sat down to game out his chances at becoming prime minister, he concluded it ""would be almost impossible for someone like me to win"" unless May's deal was passed.

 The Independent 
 The ban on protests against  LGBT+ lessons at a  Birmingham primary school could be overturned as early as next week. 
 Birmingham City Council won an interim injunction at the High Court on Friday after claiming the demonstrators intimidated staff, parents and local residents. 
 The order blocks protesters from gathering outside or near Anderton Park Primary School , from distributing leaflets and from making offensive comments about staff on social media.

 However, Mrs Justice Moulder said a judge will reconsider the injunction at a hearing in Birmingham on 10 June. 
 Protesters, who face arrest if they break the order, will then have the chance to make their case in court.

 MADRID (AP) — Harry Kane's return didn't give Tottenham the spark it needed in the Champions League final. 
 Kane was back in the squad for the first time since April when he was injured in the first leg of the quarterfinals, but the striker was not a factor in the decider at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium. 
 Kane was not a threat, ending with no shots on goal and unable to create a significant scoring opportunity for teammates. 
 As Tottenham struggled to control the game, the ball rarely got to Kane at the top of the attack, and when it did he was easily contained by the Liverpool defense. 
 He called for a penalty on him late in the game, with the team already losing 2-0, but the referee let play continue. 
 Kane was doubtful for the final because of an ankle injury in the 1-0 win over Manchester City in the first leg of the quarterfinals. 
 He missed nine matches, and coach Mauricio Pochettino waited until the last minute before deciding whether to start him on Saturday. 
 Kane's replacement had been Lucas Moura, who proved decisive for the team in its run to the final.

 The Brazilian forward scored the hat trick that allowed Tottenham to come from behind and beat Ajax 3-2 in the second leg of the semifinals. He completed the hat trick with a stoppage-time goal that sealed the comeback and the team's first-ever final appearance. 
 Moura entered the final in the 66th minute, replacing Harry Winks, but also couldn't do much to help Tottenham overcome an early deficit after Mohamed Salah converted a second-minute penalty kick.

 JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — In a story May 29 about South Sudan's oil production, The Associated Press reported erroneously that production in Unity state has increased to 175,000 barrels a day. That amount is for the entire country.

 South Sudan struggles to increase oil production after war 
 South Sudan struggles to increase oil production after civil war, hurting recovery efforts 
 By SAM MEDNICK 
 Associated Press 
 JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — Oil-rich South Sudan is struggling to increase production of crude several months after the end of its civil war, and the political upheaval in neighboring Sudan is in part to blame. 
 The signing of a peace deal in September helped open the way to resuming drilling in South Sudan's key region of Unity state, but output has been more sluggish than expected in the country with Africa's third-largest oil reserves. 
 ""We had wanted to be farther along but it's not an easy task,"" the oil ministry's director-general, Awow Daniel Chuang, told The Associated Press. That has hurt recovery from a five-year conflict that killed nearly 400,000 people. Billions of dollars in oil revenue were lost during the war as many oil rigs were shut down or destroyed. 
 Production in South Sudan has increased to 175,000 barrels a day since September but is far from the target of 200,000 barrels. Before the civil war began in late 2013, production across the country had been about 350,000 barrels a day, according to the oil ministry. 
 Chuang attributed the slow recovery in part to technical challenges, the lack of funds for new machinery and fluctuating oil prices. 
 The surprise ouster of Sudan's long-time dictator Omar al-Bashir in April also has complicated recovery. South Sudan and Sudan share an oil pipeline and other resources, and earlier this month South Sudan's oil minister had to travel to Sudan to release materials stranded at Port Sudan, the sole port for South Sudan's oil exports, because workers were busy protesting issues related to the post-Bashir transition. 
 Despite the obstacles, South Sudan's government says it should come close to achieving its oil production target by year's end when it expects all five rigs in Unity state to be operational. Three are now functional.

 But industry experts say the reality on the ground has shocked potential investors and is starkly different from what the government is conveying, Shawn Duthie, senior analyst with Africa Risk Consulting, told the AP. 
 ""Our in-country sources have said that oil production has not really increased in the north and that infrastructure in some parts of Unity state were almost non-existent,"" Duthie said. 
 The International Monetary Fund, which visited South Sudan earlier this year, cited an increased daily oil production of about 20 percent. That contrasts the government's numbers, which reflect twice that amount.

 South Sudan's oil ministry said it needs approximately $1.5 billion over the next five years to invest in updated equipment to extract more oil and map unexplored areas. Many of the country's oil fields are old, which means they are producing more water than oil, the ministry said. 
 The government is reaching out to foreign investors. South Africa this month signed a $1 billion deal for oil exploration and production expected to begin this year. 
 South Sudan's oil sector continues to face scrutiny by the international community as a ""major driver"" of violence and human suffering, according to a report by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan in February. 
 The sector is also accused by human rights groups, the U.N. Security Council and others of lacking transparency. 
 Earlier this month President Salva Kiir confirmed plans to allot 30,000 barrels of oil per day to fund a road construction project signed with China's state-owned Shandong Hi-Speed Group. Instead of putting the oil money into South Sudan's Central Bank, as stipulated by last year's peace deal, the money is being deposited into a ""special fund"" in China to make the transfers easier, Information Minister Michael Makuei told the AP. 
 The deal is sounding ""loud alarm bells"" due to its lack of transparency and accountability, said Nelly Busingye, regional coordinator for east and southern Africa for Publish What You Pay, a global campaign for an open and accountable extractive industry. 
 ""This is all the more alarming because in recent years oil revenue has been used to procure weapons, fund militias and line the pockets of those in power,"" said Brian Adeba, deputy director of policy at the Enough Project, a Washington-based advocacy group.

 A tropical storm off Mexico has a 60 percent chance of a cyclone formation in the next two days. Recent satellite data indicate that circulation of a low pressure system located over the southern Bay of Campeche has become a little better defined Saturday. Satellite image courtesy NOAA 
 The 2019 Atlantic hurricane season is officially underway and the southwestern Gulf of Mexico is being monitored for potential tropical activity into early week. 
 A broad area of unsettled weather located near the west coast of the Yucatan Peninsula will move west-northwestward over the Bay of Campeche this weekend. 
 A disturbance off Mexico has a 60 percent chance of a cyclone formation in the next two days, according to the National Hurricane Center. Recent satellite data indicate that circulation of a low pressure system has become a little better defined Saturday. 
 RELATED Study: Impacts of extreme weather on communities influences climate beliefs

 ""Given sufficiently warm water, this low pressure area could evolve into an organized tropical system,"" AccuWeather Hurricane Expert Dan Kottlowski said. 
 There is also relatively low wind shear , or changing of wind speed and/or direction with altitude, over the Bay of Campeche, which provides a conducive environment for tropical features to organize. 
 RELATED Levee failures along Mississippi, Arkansas rivers prompt mandatory evacuations 
 However, Kottlowski pointed out that the potential for strengthening may be limited since the feature will remain close to land and over the water for a short amount of time. 
 Still, strengthening to a tropical depression or even a tropical storm is possible before the low pressure area reaches the east coast of Mexico on Monday into Tuesday. 
 Should the feature manage to stay offshore and take a more northward track, perhaps paralleling the Mexico and South Texas coast, the chance of development to a tropical storm may be significantly greater. 
 The next tropical storm that develops in the Atlantic will be called Barry. 
 Regardless of whether it strengthens into a full-fledged tropical system, heavy rainfall will inundate Mexico into early week. 
 ""This heavy rainfall could lead to life-threatening flash flooding and landslides,"" Kottlowski said. 
 Some of the tropical moisture may be pulled northward into the United States next week. 
 ""There is great concern that torrential downpours associated with the feature, developed or not, may overlap areas that are currently being hit hard by flooding or teetering on the edge of flooding over the South Central states during the first full week of June,"" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said. 
 ""The moisture from the tropical feature may combine with a non-tropical storm from Texas and Louisiana to parts of Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Iowa,"" Sosnowski said of the situation next week. 
 Areas of Oklahoma, southeastern Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Louisiana and Arkansas, that were lashed with flooding downpours and severe weather during the second half of May and continue to deal with major river flooding. 
 Subtropical Storm Andrea became the first named storm of the season when it spun up southwest of Bermuda on May 20. 
 This marked the fifth consecutive year with a named storm in the Atlantic basin before the official start of the season. 
 The official season lasts from June 1 until Nov. 30.

 Apple iPhone XS 
 The Good The iPhone 5S delivers an improved camera, a nifty fingerprint sensor, and a next-gen CPU and motion-tracking chip. Apple throws in the iWork app suite for free. iOS 7 adds some nice step-ups, too, including AirDrop file transfers and the Android-like Control Center. 
 The Bad External design is identical to that of the iPhone 5, including a 4-inch screen that looks downright tiny next to Android competitors. For now, the fingerprint sensor only works with Apple apps. The 64-bit A7 processor and M7 motion-tracking chip don't have killer apps yet. iOS 7 differences are potentially jarring for longtime iPhone users. 
 The Bottom Line The iPhone 5S is not a required upgrade, but it's easily the fastest and most advanced Apple smartphone to date. 
 8.5 Overall 
 Apple iPhone 5S 
 Summer 2018 update 
 Apple no longer sells the iPhone 5S. Though you may still be able to scoop one up new or used from a third-party, you're better off buying the iPhone SE , the least expensive model in Apple's current lineup, which starts at $349, £265 or AU$465. That noted, if you can hold out until September, it's highly likely that you'll have  a new batch of iPhones  to choose from as well as lower prices for the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus,  iPhone 8 ,  iPhone 8 Plus ,  iPhone X  and perhaps the iPhone SE -- if it's not discontinued or updated . 
 The full review of the Apple iPhone 5S, originally posted on Sep. 17, 2013 and last updated on Mar. 21 2016, follows. 
 Editors' note (March 21, 2016): Apple has discontinued the 2013 iPhone 5S reviewed here, and replaced it with the iPhone SE . The new model is basically a 5S body with the innards of the late 2015 iPhone 6S . 
 Editors' note (September 19, 2014): The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are now the flagship phones in Apple's 2014-2015 product line. However, in addition to the iPhone 5C , the iPhone 5S (reviewed here) will remain on sale at a reduced price. The 16GB model now sells in two configurations: 16GB ($99 with a typical 2-year contract in the US, $549 off contract; £459 in the UK; AU$749 in the Australia) and 32GB ($149 on contract, $599 off contract in the US; £499 in the UK; and AU$799 in Australia). 
 I'm tempted to call the iPhone 5S the iPhone 5P, for ""potential."" This is Apple's half-step year, a rebuilding year. It's telegraphed by the name itself: adding an ""S"" versus giving the phone a whole new name. The 5S introduces technologies that could transform the future of iOS as a computing platform, and maybe pave the way for future products in 2014. But it doesn't manifest these changes right off the bat. Its promises haven't come to fruition yet. 
 Last year's iPhone 5 was the  best iPhone we'd ever seen. It met nearly all our wishes and  expectations. It added tons of new features. It had LTE. What did Apple  do this year as an encore? It added...a few new improvements. Enter the  iPhone 5S, which along with the iPhone 5C mark the first time Apple's delivered two new iPhones in one year. But  the 5C is really the iPhone 5 in colored plastic. There's really only  one new iPhone, and that's the 5S.

 We wanted a bigger screen , an improved camera, and better battery life. Apple gave us a fingerprint sensor, an improved camera, and a faster processor. Faster is better, especially when battery life doesn't suffer, but the 5S doesn't feel like a shocking new product.

 Apple does this every other year with iPhones -- see the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4S. It's a common occurrence in iPads and MacBooks, too: take a familiar form, and repeat. But, in a phone landscape dominated by rapid change, it can feel frustrating, even for a product we loved just 12 months ago. Even iOS 7 , Apple's graphically overhauled operating system, feels different but not really all that shocking. Even the new colors -- gold and ""space gray"" -- are subtler than you realize. 
 That doesn't mean there aren't changes, but many of them seem like roadwork for the future; a cleverly ingenious under-the-home-button fingerprint sensor, a clearly better camera, majorly upgraded graphics, a motion-tracking M7 coprocessor, and a new A7 processor capable of 64-bit computing are a lot of under-the-hood tweaks. But, after a week of using the iPhone 5S, it's hard to find situations that currently take advantage of these features, except for the fingerprint sensor and camera. 
 Check back in two months; after new apps emerge, maybe the iPhone 5S will start seeming like a truly new iPhone. But, for now, it's more of refined improvement. The iPhone 5 has gotten better. How much better depends on how fast apps and services can take advantage of the features...or whether we'll be waiting until iOS 8 to see them truly take shape. 
 Editors' note: Updated September 30, 2013, with expanded M7 fitness-tracking section and hands-on with M7-compatible apps, an additional battery test, and observations on real-use battery after several weeks of use. We will continue to update this review in the coming days, based on subsequent testing. Ratings should be considered tentative, and may evolve as testing continues.

 Design: Take the iPhone 5, and add gold (or 'space gray') 
 The iPhone 5 was a somewhat subtle but completely thorough redesign of the iPhone, from screen size to headphone placement. It introduced an aluminum frame, a thinner and lighter build, and came in two colors.

 iPhone 5 and 5S. Can you tell the difference? 
 CNET staff 
 The 5S is a carbon copy, with some new color variations. You can get last year's white/silver color, or ""space gray,"" which matches black glass and a darker gray anodized aluminum. And, yes, there's gold. But it's not like a prop from Liberace's home: it's mellow gold, more a champagne, or a light bronze. Paired with white glass on the back and front, you might have a hard time noticing the gold in the wild unless it was held in the sun. Of the three colors, I liked gray the best: the metal tones might do a better job hiding scratches, too, a problem I saw pop up on last year's all-black iPhone 5.

 A year later, the iPhone 5's design still feels sleek and high-end in the 5S, great in the hand, and more compact than most competitor phones. But, it also has a smaller screen (4 inches) than most of its Android cousins. I love using a more compact phone, but competitors have found a way to make larger-screened 4.7-inch phones with excellent feel, like the Moto X , which has nearly edge-to-edge screen across its face. The iPhone 5S has a lot more bezel framing the display, and I couldn't help wondering if that screen couldn't be just a bit bigger. 
 A larger screen would have really helped this year: not because the competition has it, but because Apple's newest features and apps would put it to good use. I found editing and appreciating the improved photos and video recording, and even playing games, to be challenging; the better that graphics and camera quality get, the more you need a larger screen to appreciate them. 
 Configurations 
 There's no 128GB iPhone this year; you'll have to once again pick between 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB, at the same $199/$299/$399 prices. In the US, Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon are the three carriers to offer the iPhone 5S under contract; T-Mobile sells the iPhone 5S in an unlocked, contract-free version that costs $649 for 16GB, $749 for 32GB, and $849 for 64GB. 
 All versions come with the same A7 processor.

 Touch ID: The party-trick tech on the 5S 
 See that little home button down there? It doesn't have a square on it anymore. It's also flat and recessed, not concave. That's practically the only outward-facing indication the iPhone 5S offers to the world, but lurking under the button is the most interesting piece of iPhone tech in quite some time. Unfortunately, it doesn't do as much right now as I wish it could. 
 View full gallery 
 CNET staff 
 ""Touch ID"" is Apple's fingerprint sensor, a secret sauce of clever scanning technology that amounts to a home button that's now both capacitive and clickable. The fact it does both can be a little disorienting at first, but the clicking is what the home button normally does, while gently touching the sensor activates the fingerprint scan. 
 26 Photos 
 Touch ID's simple round button works on a simple press, versus a ""swipe"" gesture on a lot of previous fingerprint readers. The scanning technology, when it registers your fingerprint, encourages you to press from a variety of angles, so your fingerprint can be read even on its side or on an edge. It's fast: a simple click on the button and the phone unlocks, the scan happening invisibly. Most people won't even know it scanned them, but try another finger and you'll see that it worked. 
 A few previous smartphones have added fingerprint sensors before, like the Motorola Atrix , but those were more awkward bars that needed finger-swiping. The Touch ID-enabled home button feels invisible; it works with a tap, can recognize your finger from many angles, and feels like it has less of a fail rate than fingerprint sensors I've used on laptops. It's impressive tech. It worked on all my fingers, and even my toe (I was curious). 
 Its only limitation, really, is how little Apple has employed Touch ID into the iPhone experience at the moment. Scanning your finger takes the place of entering a passcode in most instances, or entering a password every time you purchase something from the App Store or iTunes. But, that's all Touch ID does for now: it doesn't remember your other passwords on various cloud services, or link to your credit card, or pay for movie tickets via Fandango. 
 View full gallery 
 CNET staff 
 In fact, you'd better remember whatever passcode you used to lock your phone, because Touch ID isn't a pure replacement. If you restart your iPhone, or turn it off and on, or don't use it for 48 hours, it'll ask for your passcode again before allowing fingerprint recognition. That's potentially useful as an extra deterrent for would-be fingerprint thieves, but it proved a little quirky over a week of use. I never knew when the 5S might insist I enter my passcode again. 
 Worried about a kid pressing his finger down over and over and erasing your phone's memory? Never fear. Touch ID cleverly defaults to asking for a passcode after three fingerprint attempts, and after five bad tries, it requires it. Then you still have 10 passcode attempts before any ""erase contents after 10 passcode failures"" setting you've possibly enabled kicks in. 
 How much time does it save? A little, especially since this process skips the ""swipe to unlock"" gesture. You'll also save a few seconds over entering a passcode. But, in terms of convenience, I really only appreciated it during the day, in those little moments when I quickly needed to hop on my phone. 
 I have a bigger dream for Touch ID, of its fingerprint scan acting as a password replacement for third-party apps or even a way to make payments, or check in to flights. It could be a mobile wallet killer app, and a companion to Apple's somewhat dormant PassBook app that launched with iOS 6. But those extra features won't be coming anytime soon. Apple currently intends Touch ID and your fingerprint -- which gets encrypted as mathematical data, according to Apple, not an image -- to stay on the A7 chip of the iPhone 5S, out of reach of third-party apps or cloud services. That could be good for added security, but it means Touch ID isn't a magic remember-every-password savior or credit card replacement yet.

 That being said, I expect Touch ID to make its way onto every Apple device: iPads next, and eventually Macs. Why not? It's easy to use. 
 Camera 
 Touch ID may be getting all the headlines lately, but the iPhone 5S' improved camera is probably its biggest selling point. Cameras are no longer afterthoughts on smartphones: they're becoming the most important feature, for many, as they slowly but surely replace point-and-shoot cameras. 
 If you're getting a new iPhone for its camera, get the 5S. A suite of new and useful upgrades help make the already-good iPhone 5 camera into something even better...but, in a landscape riddled with increasingly impressive phone cameras, the iPhone stands out a little less than before. 
 View full gallery 
 CNET staff 
 Unlike many megapixel-packing smartphones (41-megapixel Lumia 1020 , I'm looking at you), the iPhone 5S camera stays at 8 megapixels, the same on paper as last year and even the year before. The sensor, as Apple will proclaim, however, is 15 percent larger: the pixels are physically bigger (1.5 microns), even if there are the same number of them. The camera's aperture is larger (f/2.2). All of these elements add up to better low-light exposure.

 Newer A7-driven processing also enables true burst-mode shooting: hold down the shutter button and you'll snag as many shots as you desire. The iPhone 5 could take multiple shots with quick taps, but the iPhone 5S can capture rapid-motion activities like sports events (or, in my household, random baby tricks). Instead of spamming your Camera Roll with identical-looking images, the new iOS 7 camera app cleverly bundles them in a subfolder, and even autopicks what it considers the best shots. This decision is based on image crispness and other factors; sometimes it's on the money, but I also saw it pick a blurry image of my 7-month-old over a sullen but crisp side profile. You can pick your own favorites easily, and delete the rest at the touch of a button.

 I took a bunch of shots in a ton of conditions, from indoor photos in a zoo's reptile house to still-lifes of flowers and colorful kitchen accessories. Close-up photos show off pretty incredible detail and a shallower depth-of-field effect, which feels more ""SLR-like."" See this rug picture, for instance.

 Kid photos in lower light conditions were less blurry when magnified. Blurriness is a common problem I've seen on many of my iPhone 5 photos taken in lower light that look good enough on-phone, but don't hold up quite as well via Apple TV on a 59-inch display. These 5S pictures looked a lot better, and more consistently so. 
 View full gallery 
 Sarah Tew/CNET 
 Apple credits this to a new image signal processor (ISP) on the iPhone 5S' A7 processor. It does result in quicker autofocus, faster snapshots, and less blur all around. Considering how shaky the average person's hand is when taking casual phone shots, it's a necessary improvement. 
 Apple has made a big change to the built-in LED flash, too, doubling its size and creating an intelligent ""True Tone"" flash that senses the photo environment and serves up the appropriate flash tone from separate white and amber LEDs. 
 It's a splashy endeavor, but the results do look significantly better, and warmer, than the iPhone 5's flash pics. I avoid flash on my smartphone whenever humanly possible, but this year's improvements may have changed my opinion. 
 The 1080p video recording also gains a little more digital stabilization, 3x digital zoom thanks to iOS 7, and there's a new Slo-Mo recording mode, which is separately toggled in the camera app. The iPhone records 720p video at 120 frames per second, and applies the slow-motion effect afterward, playing at 30 frames per second. 
 You can readjust the start and stop points of slow motion with your fingers, much like editing a video clip. It looks great, but the slowed-down footage retains the audio track. You could always edit over it in iMovie (which is a free app, now, anyway). This type of ultrafast recording could earn the iPhone 5S a spot on a skateboarder's helmet or a skydiver's gear in place of the popular GoPro camera. 
 Now, how different is all of this from competing high-end phones boasting better cameras? The iPhone 5S suffers on physical megapixel count, but its speed/quality ratio are hard to beat. Adding slow-motion recording is gimmicky but works really well, and the improved flash technology is nice to have. But, overall, it's the extra speed and hardware-software-processor integration on the iPhone 5S that produced the best results. The camera is really the iPhone 5S' biggest improvement and feature, even without added megapixels...but it doesn't feel like as dramatic a leap as last year's iPhone 5's camera. 
 A7 processor: A beast on paper 
 We're in a pretty great time for mobile phone processors. Much like laptops and PCs a few years ago, impressive year-over-year gains in speed are becoming the norm. The iPhone 5 was more than twice as fast as the iPhone 4S, and true to Apple's claims based on every benchmark we could find, the iPhone 5S and its new A7 processor seem at least twice as fast as the 5 and its A6. 
 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited 
 Note: 
 (Longer bars indicate better performance) 
 Numbers are great, but what does speed really mean in a phone? Sometimes it's hard to appreciate. Boot times aren't all that much faster between the iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, and iPhone 5 -- 26.3 seconds for the 5S, and 31.7 for the 5C (and anyway, how many times do we even boot our phones?). Games and applications load up quickly and play smoothly, but the iPhone 5 felt the same way last year, and the iPhone 5C still feels pretty fast for everyday phone tasks. 
 The types of games and applications that can really take advantage of the iPhone 5S and its faster, more graphics-rich A7 processor aren't here yet at the time of this review, but expect them soon. I'm just sensing, perhaps, that there will be a limit as to how much pop you'll truly notice on a 4-inch display. 
 Is the iPhone 5S faster than other phones like the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One ? Based on every benchmark we could throw at the 5S, the answer is yes. How much? That depends on the test. Linpack suggests that the iPhone 5S is a lot faster -- and about twice as fast as the iPhone 5C. Geekbench 3, which recently updated its app to allow for 64-bit testing, suggests a nearly 3x gain over the iPhone 5C's A6 processor. 
 The 64-bit computing potential of the iPhone 5S and its A7 chip is, at the moment, largely theoretical. It could pave the way to more computer-like experiences on our phones, or even a future merge between Mac OS X and iOS.

 Apple's core apps on the 5S are 64-bit optimized, but I didn't anecdotally appreciate huge gains in most of them...except for the camera. It's hard to tell how the A7 will make the iPhone 5S better, even if you can sense the speed. The killer apps don't seem to be here yet.",1
61973,"Germantown alderman reports threatening message left in mailbox 
 Posted 5:18 pm, May 31, 2019, by Stacy Jacobson , Updated at 06:36PM, May 31, 2019 
 GERMANTOWN, Tenn. — A Germantown alderman says he’s afraid for his life after finding a bizarre threat left in his mailbox at City Hall. 
 The question now: Is it a bad prank or a real cause for concern? 
 Dean Massey says he found an illustration left in his mailbox that could come off as a joke. It says “some people just need a pat on the back” and shows an image of someone presumably pushing someone else off a ledge. 
 Massey did not take it as a joke, instead reporting to police. He says it’s politically motivated, and police say they're investigating it as harassment. 
 ""Every night, I worry somebody’s going to come by and try to do something to my family,” Massey said by phone Friday. 
 Massey says he sees this as a much deeper issue.  His political opponents are trying to silence him, since only other city staff has access to this area. 
 ""There are city officials and employees who have interests in some of the issues citizens of Germantown have asked me to speak out against,” he said. 
 Some of those issues include opposition to plans to build an outdoor space at the Germantown Performing Arts Center and to a proposed cell phone tower next to Dogwood Elementary. 
 Massey has been at odds with the Germantown mayor, like when he sparred with Mike Palazzolo during a Board of Aldermen meeting last October. 
 He says the tension has now escalated. In a Facebook post on this latest incident, he says the mayor installed new locks at City Hall to keep some aldermen out, and says all city officials should get screened for drugs. 
 While he admits that was an exaggeration — he's never seen city officials using drugs, he said — he still says this is a sign of the extreme discord within Gerrmantown City Hall. 
 Mayor Mike Palazzolo declined our request for an interview and a spokesperson told us he has no comment.

 The Tokyo Olympics organizing committee said Saturday the torch relay next year would pass through major Japanese landmarks, including World Heritage sites and areas devastated by recent natural disasters. 
 The torch will travel to 857 municipalities in all of Japan's 47 prefectures, highlighting symbols of reconstruction from the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, that killed nearly 16,000 people, and the subsequent Fukushima nuclear crisis. 
 About 10,000 torch bearers will participate over the 121-day relay, with the organizers revealing the specific routes later this year. 
 The torch will pass through municipalities heavily hit by the disaster in northeastern Japan. It will begin on March 26, 2020, at Fukushima Prefecture's J-Village, a soccer training center that was an operational base for dealing with the nuclear crisis. 
 The ""Miracle Pine"" monument, in a park dedicated to a tree that remained standing when all the other 70,000 around it were washed away by the tsunami, is among the various landmarks from the northeastern region. On the first day, the torch will also travel through Okuma, where one part of the crippled Fukushima nuclear complex is located. 
 The torch will also visit World Heritage sites designated by UNESCO, including Mt. Fuji, and the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, dedicated to the victims of the world's first atomic bombing in 1945. 
 The flame will make its entrance at Tokyo's New National Stadium on July 24 during the opening ceremony.",1
30357,"School investigations delayed by 'unhealthy workload' in secretive unit 
 Larger text size 
 Very large text size 
 Investigators probing misconduct within the state's education system are crippled by an ""extremely unhealthy"" workload, and have so many cases on their books that complaints can take months or even years to resolve, insiders say. 
 Each investigator might be looking into as many as 20 complaints ranging in importance from staff disputes to racist, sexist or offensive language or bullying behaviour. Investigations involve talking to dozens of witnesses at schools across NSW. 
 ""You could double this workforce, work seven days a week, and still not get through your work,"" said one person familiar with the investigations. ""You do not feel you are making a difference."" 
 School investigators are overwhelmed by their workload, insiders say.

 Last week, the Sun Herald reported on concerns that a secretive misconduct unit within the NSW Department of Education is slow, secretive and struggles to ensure procedural fairness when complaints are made against teachers and principals. 
 Advertisement 
 The department has enlisted former crown prosecutor Mark Tedeschi to review the Employee Performance and Conduct directorate (EPAC), and he is due to report later this month. 
 More teachers, principals and parents with experience of EPAC have since contacted the Sun Herald, saying they felt their process was not fair. But people familiar with the inner workings of the unit said the main problem was significant under-resourcing. 
 Loading 
 The heavy caseload meant that it could sometimes take months to give an accused staff member the details of their accusation, and then more time to collect witness statements from those involved, one person familiar with the unit said. Some investigations could run for two years. 
 Investigators dealt with allegations ranging from the serious to the petty, including issues that should have been dealt with at a local level. ""[Investigators would] still have to go through the whole process of putting them on the system."" 
 A spokesman for the NSW Education Department said EPAC was provided with more resources in 2017, which meant that this year investigators had fewer than 20 cases each. 
 One of the insiders also said principals sometimes interviewed or collected statements from children before EPAC became involved. 
 Investigators have to let parents know about an interview, but principals did not have to. Moreover, their interviews were often flawed because ""they don't have the training and ability to manage witnesses in an appropriate manner,"" the source said. 
 Parents said they too had been dragged into investigations. Some complained of being named in reports without being interviewed, and others said they were asked to give statements but not told details of the allegations. 
 Anna Noon, a member of a Macquarie P&C, was caught up in an EPAC investigation after a controversial principal appointment approval process. Ms Noon declined an EPAC request for interview because she was not told the grounds of the claims, nor who raised them. 
 ""Then in turn I became a line of enquiry, and given that I am not a staff member, I question whether that's in EPAC's jurisdiction,"" she said. 
 Labor's education spokesman, Jihad Dib - also a former teacher and principal - said it was important for the education department to have a unit that held staff to high standards, but EPAC had failed to engage with, or explain its procedures to, staff. 
 Loading 
 ""I don't want a situation where the body that's meant to be making sure that things are right is such a feared body that people don't feel that they can approach them or that they can have a fair hearing,"" Mr Dib said. 
 Mr Dib said the Tedeschi review had not been widely publicised, so many people had missed out on the opportunity to make a submission. A spokesman for the department said details were published on the public website, with a submission form. 
 Key stakeholders were contacted, and submissions were extended by a week to the end of March. About 100 submissions were received, but they are being kept confidential. 
 Concerns about EPAC were also raised by Shooters, Fishers and Farmers upper house member Mark Banasiak - a former school teacher - in parliament last week. ""Our kids deserve a system that supports brilliant teachers, not one that breaks them,"" he said.

47396,"Bye-bye BBM: BlackBerry shuts down once-beloved messaging service 
 BlackBerry has shut down its once-popular instant messaging service known as BlackBerry Messenger, or BBM, as the company continues to reinvent itself as a security software provider after years of making phones.

 BlackBerry has shut down its once-popular instant messaging service known as BlackBerry Messenger, or BBM. 
 According to the website Crackberry , BBM users were logged out of instant messaging platforms and left with a goodbye message reading “BBM Consumer has signed off.” 
 “We are proud of what we have built to date,” Emtek, the company that in 2016 took over the operation of the BBM app, wrote in a blog post announcing the shutdown. “The technology industry however, is very fluid, and in spite of our substantial efforts, users have moved on to other platforms, while new users proved difficult to sign on.” 
 BBM, which arrived on mobile devices in 2005, was one of the first free instant messaging platforms and one of the world’s most popular mobile social networks. A predecessor to the Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Apple’s iMessage, it was also one of the first instant messaging services to feature read receipts. 
 In 2012, the word “BBM,” which could be used as both a noun and a verb, was added to the Collins English dictionary. 
 The Waterloo, Ont.-based tech firm has in recent years shifted its focus from handsets as it reinvents itself into a software development business. 
 It says that it will continue to offer BBMe, a messaging service that is similar to its predecessor. But while the service will only be free for the first year, users will have to pay for a subscription after that. as the tech company continues to shift its focus from handsets to its software development business.

 Whether it be the MLS playoffs or U.S. Open Cup, the recent chapters of the Dynamo's matches with Sporting Kansas City have been contentious, and Saturday's game proved no different as the rivals drew to a 1-1 tie at BBVA Compass Stadium. 
 ""I think we went out the first half a little flat, not well-coordinated to do our pressure,"" coach Wilmer Cabrera said. ""Sadly, the players from Kansas City started to manage the game and delayed and it was too much for the referee. Today was really embarrassing how the players noticed they could waste time, dive, delay, everything, and the referee didn't care."" 
 After a physical first half, a 10-minute window in the second half largely decided the outcome of the game. An improved Dynamo defense exerted its control early, limiting Kansas City (3-5-6, 15 points) to two first-half shots — both off target. The Dynamo finished the game with six corner kicks to none for Sporting Kansas City. 
 The Dynamo (7-3-3, 24 points) outshot Kansas City 15-5 on the game, but Sporting seized control in the 63rd minute. Just moments after Dynamo forward Romell Quioto's pass in to Tomas Martinez proved fruitless, Kansas City quickly transitioned up the other side of the field through a long ball from Ilie Sanchez to Yohan Croizet. 
 Dynamo defender Adam Lundkvist appeared to have the ball covered but Croizet made a strong push for it, using his head to knock it ahead to himself before bursting past the Swedish defender. Perhaps sensing how far out Dynamo keeper Joe Willis had ventured to try to halt the attack, Croizet popped a gorgeous chip over Willis that hung in the air just long enough to beat defender Aljaz Struna to the back of the net. 
 ""We want to pressure, we want to play (our style). I understand they want to slow the game, it was humid, they played on Wednesday, it's normal,"" Cabrera said of Kansas City. ""(Referee Kevin Stott) never showed that he wanted the game to flow and when the game doesn't flow it affects us because we want to get the rhythm."" 
 In the rivalry, both teams have battled through playoff and domestic cup eliminations. With the Dynamo's home unbeaten mark in jeopardy, Saturday's game appeared to add another layer to the feud. And in the 69th minute Dynamo forward Alberth Elis, making his return from a concussion he suffered against D.C. United, rose to the occasion. 
 After Maynor Figueroa — also making his return after the death of his father — lobbed a high arcing pass to A.J. DeLaGarza from the opposite side of the field, DeLaGarza directed the ball to Elis within the area. The forward launched himself into the air, angling his body to the side then slapped the ball just inside the net as keeper Tim Melia tried to close the space. 
 The goal is his fifth of the year. Elis needs five to tie Giles Barnes for fifth in club history. 
 The Dynamo continued to push forward, with Elis unable to finish a handful of close opportunities while Boniek Garcia had his shot saved after it floated into Melia's arms. 
 The Dynamo have a two-week break — a period that includes the league's CONCACAF Gold Cup break — before MLS play resumes at Portland on June 22. Before then, they'll begin their U.S. Open Cup title defense at BBVA Compass Stadium on June 11 against Austin Bold. 
 ""We're going to lose six guys so we have to work hard,"" Cabrera said. ""We cannot make excuses.""",1

 HUNT'S HUFF 
 Jeremy Hunt denies ‘flip-flopping’ over leaving the EU and says he would pick ‘no deal’ over no Brexit 
 By Matt Dathan, Senior Political Correspondent 
 1st June 2019, 1:05 am 
 Updated: 1st June 2019, 1:49 am 
 PM hopeful Jeremy Hunt last night hit back at Tory critics who branded him a flip-flopper over Brexit and insisted his position has never changed. 
 The Foreign Secretary was said to have lost ground to Cabinet rival Michael Gove after branding a No Deal Brexit “suicidal” for Tory chances at the next General Election.

 Mr Hunt rebuffed claims that he has changed his stance over the EU on BBC's Political Thinking podcast last nightCredit: AFP or licensors 
 That came just a month after insisting he would “choose no deal over no Brexit.” 
 He has also been accused of U-turning over his support for a second referendum and single market membership. 
 But he told the BBC’s Political Thinking podcast last night: “Look, you always get these insults flying around but what you have to do is tell the truth as you see it. My position actually has not changed on Europe at all. 
 “I said once the referendum happened we must respect it, we must keep ‘no deal’ on the table. 
 “I’ve been very clear that if ultimately there was a choice between ‘no deal’ and no Brexit , and you could only choose one of those two, I would choose ‘no deal’, but it’s not a choice I want to have. 
 “But I also think that we need to have a proper debate about how we get to that outcome and the fact is that we have made mistakes in the negotiations as a government in the last two years. 
 ""We need to learn from those mistakes and we need to deliver Brexit, and so I think my job is to make sure that we have a proper debate about how we do that.” 
 MISERABLE TRAVESTY OF DEMOCRACY 
 Meanwhile Mark Harper, the 12th Tory MP to enter the leadership race, was immediately dismissed by Brexiteers yesterday after saying he would be willing to seek a further Brexit extension. 
 Former Tory chief whip Mark Harper said a “short, focused extension” to the end of the year might be necessary because there may be “some problems” in renegotiating a deal with Brussels. 
 He said the new European Commission won’t be up and running until November - after the current October 31 Brexit deadline - and taking a dig at Brexiteer rivals Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab , he added: “That, I think is a realistic strategy. 
 “It’s not very easy to boil down into some soundbites. But frankly, anyone who pretends that this process is soundbiteable probably ought to be laughed at, because it isn’t that straightforward.” 
 Criticising Mr Harper’s willingness to countenance another extension, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: “The only way we’ll get the backstop removed from the Withdrawal Agreement is to convince the EU that we’re willing to leave without a deal on October 31 and asking for a further extension will only undermine the UK position. 
 “Mark Harper might be willing to extend Article 50 but I don’t think the British people are prepared to extend this miserable travesty of democracy any longer.

 “The next PM’s got to be determined and steadfast that we’re leaving on the 31st October if the EU don’t make a considerably better offer - and we’ll be leaving without a deal.” 
 Meanwhile Health Secretary Matt Hancock won the backing of 20 leading businessmen yesterday - including Dragons Den star Theo Paphitis - after the leadership contender hit out at Boris’s infamous “f*** business” slur earlier this week. 
 A source close to Mr Hancock said: “Theo knows a winner when he sees one.”

 SAJID Javid is prepared to take Britain out of Europe without a deal, it has emerged. 
 The Home Secretary and Tory leadership contender, right, called for preparations for it to be stepped up, the Daily Telegraph reports . 
 He believes the EU election results made it more likely Parliament would allow a No Deal if the necessary preparations are made.

 Arrest in 43-year-old murder case stuns Wisconsin town 
 IVAN MORENO 
 • 
 June 1, 2019 
 LAKEWOOD, Wis. (AP) — Word of the arrest — via a friend's text message — hit Wayne Sankey like a thunderbolt. 
 ""I said, 'You gotta be kidding me,'"" Sankey recalled. ""And then I told the wife and she couldn't believe it. 'There's no way,' she said. 'Ray down the road?'"" 
 Ray Vannieuwenhoven was his next-door neighbor — a helpful, 82-year-old handyman with a gravelly voice and a loud, distinctive laugh. 
 The widower and father of five grown children had lived quietly for two decades among the 800 residents of Lakewood, a northern Wisconsin town. 
 Now authorities were saying he was a killer. They had used genetic genealogy to crack a cold case that stretched back well into the 20th century — a double murder 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Lakewood. 
 For nearly 43 years, Vannieuwenoven had lived in plain sight, yet outside detectives' radar. 
 It was just too much to be believed. Was the guy next door really a monster? 
 ___ 
 David Schuldes and Ellen Matheys, engaged to be married, set up their campsite at a secluded spot in McClintock Park on Friday afternoon, July 9, 1976. 
 It appeared they were alone. 
 Two shots from a .30-caliber rifle shattered the quiet. One bullet struck Schuldes' neck from 50 feet (15 meters) away, killing him instantly. The other bullet lodged in the wall of the bathroom Matheys was using while Schuldes waited outside. 
 Matheys ran, with the killer in pursuit, investigators say. He caught and raped her, then shot her twice in the chest. Her body was found 200 yards (182 meters) from where Schuldes lay. 
 Investigators were stumped: They didn't know why the couple was targeted, the killer took no money, and leads were scant. 
 DNA profiling in the '90s brought new hope, but detectives got no matches when they submitted the semen from Matheys' shorts to the FBI's national database. 
 Then last year, detectives contacted Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a DNA technology company whose work with genetic genealogy analysis has helped police identify 55 suspects in cold cases nationwide since May 2018, according to the company. Parabon uploads DNA from crime scenes to GEDmatch, a free, public genealogy database with about 1.2 million profiles, all voluntarily submitted by people who've used consumer genealogy sites. 
 California law enforcement used GEDmatch to capture the Golden State Killer last year by finding distant relatives and reverse-engineering his family tree. 
 Using that technique, Parabon's experts concluded in December that Vannieuwenhoven's parents had lived in the Green Bay area. Now detectives needed DNA samples from Vannieuwenhoven and his three brothers. Two were ruled out with DNA samples collected from one brother's trash and another's used coffee cup. 
 On March 6, two sheriff's deputies knocked on Vannieuwenhoven's door, asking him to fill out a brief survey on area-policing. They told him to put the survey in an envelope and seal it with his tongue. 
 Detectives didn't need to visit the fourth brother. Eight days later, Vannieuwenhoven was in custody.

 At Vannieuwenhoven's first court appearance, on March 22, bond was set at $1 million. 
 ""Not guilty, not guilty, not guilty,"" Vannieuwenhoven said, when the judge asked him if he understood the charges. His next court date is June 19. 
 Kurt Schuldes, 68, a cousin of David Schuldes in Green Bay, welcomed the news of an arrest, but lamented the time it took: ""He just got away with it for way too long, unfortunately."" 
 ""It was a long time coming,"" said Cynthia Chizek, Matheys' 53-year-old niece, who lives in Henderson, Nevada. ""It's just something that always hangs over your head, knowing that there's someone out there who did this heinous crime."" 
 Prosecutors and Lakewood residents, meanwhile, were left with the question: Who is Raymand Lawrence Vannieuwenhoven? 
 Richard Leurquin, twin brother of Vannieuwenhoven's dead wife, Rita, said his brother-in-law was ""a very loving father to his wife and kids."" He's convinced Vannieuwenhoven is innocent. 
 After Rita died in 2008, Sankey said Vannieuwenhoven spent his days fishing, hunting, and going on weeks-long camping trips. 
 But Vannieuwenhoven had a dark side and has been jailed before. 
 In 1957, already married and going by the name Lawrence Vannieuwenhoven, he received a six-month sentence for an unprovoked attack on a 17-year-old girl. She was walking with three friends when Vannieuwenhoven struck her on the back, face, and shoulder. 
 In 1960, he pleaded guilty to not providing financial support to his wife and their 1-year-old daughter, the Green Bay Press-Gazette reported then. He was on probation for a year. 
 More recently, some neighbors caught glimpses of a menacing side when he drank. He stopped only a few years ago, for his health, they said. 
 ""I know this much — when he was drinking he was one son of a bitch,"" said Fred Mason, 66, who works at the town dump where Vannieuwenhoven was seen frequently, rummaging through scrap piles. 
 Robert Ganzell, 86, and his wife sometimes dined out with Vannieuwenhoven. He heard from others that he had a temper when he drank, but Ganzell said he never witnessed it. 
 Sankey, 68, said he and his wife are still coming to terms with the allegations against their neighbor. 
 ""People had the impression that he was a very good, normal person, just a retired guy,"" Sankey said.

 May 28, 2019 at 1:31a.m. 
 Tweet 
 KAWASAKI, Japan (AP) — A man carrying a knife in each hand and screaming ""I will kill you!"" attacked a group of schoolgirls waiting at a bus stop just outside Tokyo on Tuesday, killing two and injuring 16 before killing himself, officials and media said. 
 Most of the victims were schoolgirls who were lined up at a bus stop near Noborito Park in the city of Kawasaki when a man in his 40s or 50s began slashing them with knives. NHK national television, quoting police, said that the suspect died after cutting himself in the neck. Police wouldn't immediately confirm the specifics of that report. 
 Masami Arai, an official at the Kawasaki city office, said 16 people, most of them schoolgirls, were injured and three others, including the attacker, were believed killed. Arai said three of the injuries were serious and 13 others were not life-threatening. 
 Most of the victims attended a school founded by Soeurs de la Charite de Quebec, an organization of Catholic nuns in Quebec City in Canada. 
 It was not clear how old the victims were. The school runs from elementary through high school. 
 A witness told the Mainichi newspaper that he heard children shrieking after walking past a bus. He said that when he turned around, he saw a man wielding a knife in each hand, screaming ""I will kill you!"" and several children were on the ground. 
 NHK, citing police, said that a bus driver told officials that a man holding a knife in each hand walked toward the bus and started slashing children. NHK also interviewed a witness who said he saw the suspect trying to force his way onto a bus. 
 The attacker's identity and motive weren't immediately known.

 news 9 hours ago Newser — Jenn Gidman 
 President Trump will be meeting with Queen Elizabeth on Monday during his visit to the UK, and Buckingham Palace says Prince Charles, Prince William, and Kate Middleton will also be in attendance, per USA Today . 
 Prince Harry will also reportedly meet Trump during a tea with his father, per Town and Country , but Harry's wife, Meghan Markle, isn't expected to be there. 
 The official line is that Markle is still on maternity leave from her official duties to tend to her new son, Archie , though there are whispers that her absence may be tied to her vocal dislike of Trump: She said during a May 2016 interview that Trump was ""divisive"" and ""misogynistic,"" the Independent notes. 
 Trump just apparently got wind of these comments for the first time—the Sun filled him in in advance of his visit—and the president seemed to be surprised. 
 ""I didn't know that,"" he told the paper. ""What can I say? I didn't know that she was nasty."" He added he didn't know Markle might not be meeting with him during his visit, but that despite all that, he thinks she'll make a ""very good"" American princess and he wishes her well. 
 ""I am sure she will do excellently,"" he said. ""I hope she does [succeed]."" Trump also hopes his four adult children, whom he's bringing with him on the trip, will get to meet Prince William and Prince Harry.

96828,"Eagles' first male cheerleaders drew boos 
 By Frank Fitzpatrick - The Philadelphia Inquirer 
 Posted: June 1, 2019 - 4:35am 
 PHILADELPHIA (AP) — It was late in a listless Eagles exhibition game on the cool and cloudy night of Aug. 23, 1984. In Veterans Stadium's notorious 700 Level, the blood-alcohol level was as elevated as the vantage point. 
 The home team, 5-11 the previous year, was displaying little improvement. Rowdy and restless, fans booed lustily after Philadelphia rookie Evan Cooper's fumble, after two Ron Jaworski interceptions, after backup QB Joe Pisarcik was sacked twice. 
 So when the giant PhanaVision screen suddenly flashed the image of two men in skimpy shorts and sleeveless, satin T-shirts, the crowd's reaction was as predictable as the 6-9-1 Eagles season that was to follow. 
 ""There was even something new to boo this year,"" The Inquirer's Jere Longman noted in his story on the Eagles' 20-19 victory over the Browns, ""male cheerleaders."" 
 Time, attitudes, and stadiums have changed. When the Eagles open their 2019 season, the debut of Kyle Tanguay, their first male cheerleader since then, figures to pass with little note. 
 But 35 years ago, that first bracing glimpse of Paul Kramer and Mark Merschen, who that year joined 30 female counterparts on the Eagles' Liberty Belles, drew a decidedly negative response. 
 ""I think it was an idea before its time,"" Merschen said recently. 
 Other NFL teams had employed male cheerleaders. The Eagles weren't trying to foster social change when they did so and, according to some accounts, were so shaken by the Vet reception that they briefly considered shelving the experiment. 
 Whatever triggered the crowd's reaction, it was soon forgotten, and Kramer and Merschen — with a significant uniform adjustment — endured the entire 1984 season, performing at all eight regular-season home games and at public and charitable events throughout the area. 
 A year later, Norman Braman bought the team from Leonard Tose. The Eagles' cheerleading program was revamped, and Kramer and Merschen faded away. 
 Kramer moved to New York City, where he taught in the public school system for many years. He died at 57 in 2012. Merschen was a professional roller skater when he tried out on a whim. He is 59 and single and works at Philadelphia International Airport as a fleet-service agent for American Airlines. 
 Their role in franchise history was nearly forgotten until the Eagles' May 1 hiring of Tanguay. When Kramer's sister heard the news, she was annoyed that the Eagles had labeled the University of the Arts dance major their first male cheerleader. 
 ""I reached out to the Eagles, to media relations and the cheerleaders,"" Terri Kramer-Mebert said. ""Nobody contacted me. Finally, I sent Kyle a message about my brother."" 
 Kramer grew up in Wallingford, one of five children of a Westinghouse engineer and his teacher wife. He would go on to earn a master's in education from Fordham, but at the time was working with special-needs children in a Delaware County day care that his mother started. In the spring of 1984, on a dare, he responded to an ad about an Eagles cheerleader tryout. 
 ""He loved to dance,"" Kramer-Mebert recalled. ""We all took dance classes growing up. When we were clearing out my parents' house, we found all these old top hats and tap shoes. Anyway, he made the first cut and he got excited about it, so he continued. It was tough, but he eventually got picked."" 
 That same spring, Merschen, of Maple Glen, happened to be at JFK Stadium preparing for a roller-skating show. When rain postponed it, he and a fellow performer decided to walk across Pattison Avenue to the Vet, where they knew the Eagles were auditioning cheerleaders. 
 ""There was a woman in charge, and I asked her if it was open to guys,"" Merschen said. ""She said, 'Sure, why not?' So we just did some of our skating routines without skates. My friend, Tony, got cut, but I made it."" 
 Initially, a few of the Belles were cool to their new male teammates but very soon, according to Sharon Sweeney, then their choreographer, ""all the girls loved them."" 
 Unlike the women, Kramer and Merschen didn't have to carry pom-poms. And once they got past their trying debut, they abandoned the shorts — basically the same as the women were wearing — and donned Kelly green sweatpants. 
 ""But those two guys did everything that the girls did,"" recalled Sweeney, who operates an Irish-themed gift shop in Phoenixville. 
 ""They were in the Thanksgiving Parade with us. They were at all the games and went to the softball games and supermarket openings."" 
 Neither Merschen nor Sweeney remembers much booing at their debut, but there apparently was enough to make the Eagles reconsider their decision. 
 ""These guys are great,"" Sherry Lewis, the Eagles' cheerleading administrator, told the Daily News a few days later. ""But if the reaction is more negative than positive, then that will be that."" 
 Kramer-Mebert was at the game and hasn't forgotten the reaction of the preseason crowd of 40,030 to the two men. 
 ""There were a lot of jeers,"" she said. ""The people sitting behind me were carrying on and calling them names. After a while, I couldn't take it anymore and I stood up and said, 'That's my brother.' I was proud of him. I stared at them all and sat down. Later, I turned around and they were gone. 
 ""Later, I asked Paul how it felt to hear all those comments and the boos,"" she said. ""I remember he said, 'I can handle it because when we leave that stadium at night, what the girls have to hear from the people standing at the entrance is 10 times worse.' 
 ""He was very proud of being an Eagles cheerleader. He crossed a barrier.""

89615,"2019 Standard-Times Boys Lacrosse Playoff Preview 
 Friday 
 May 31, 2019 at 6:19 PM May 31, 2019 at 6:19 PM 
 Brendan Kurie    @BrendanKurieSCT 
 Five of the eight SouthCoast boys lacrosse teams qualified for the postseason and learned their seedings on Friday. 
 While GNB Voc-Tech, Old Colony and New Bedford are sitting this year’s postseason out, Apponequet, Bishop Stang, Dartmouth and Old Rochester are back in the playoffs and Fairhaven is returning after a one-year absence. 
 For a brief moment on Friday morning, it appeared Apponequet and Old Rochester would be facing off for a third time this season in the first round, but the bracket was updated and the Lakers are now playing at Bristol-Plymouth, while the Bulldogs are hosting Plymouth South. 
 Here is a look at each team’s playoff hopes: 
 Apponequet Lakers 
 Record: 9-7 
 Seed: No. 12 in Div. 2 South 
 Opening matchup: Will play at No. 5 Bristol-Plymouth (18-0) in first round on Tuesday at a time to be determined 
 Last postseason: Lost 19-5 to Falmouth in 2018 Div. 3 South first round 
 Outlook: The Lakers will see just how good an undefeated Mayflower Athletic Conference team can be. B-P beat GNB Voc-Tech 14-2 and 15-4 this season, while Apponequet topped the Bears 10-6 and 10-1 in their two meetings. “You don’t go 18-0 by accident,” said Lakers coach Jeremy Nodelman. “Obviously, they had a very good season and it’s going to be tough competition.” If the Lakers hope to keep their season going and win a playoff game for the first time since 2014, consistency will be the key. Offensively, that means moving both off-ball and with the ball and taking smart, patient shots. Defensively, that means taking good angles and playing with their feet, not their stick. The offense doesn’t feature one go-to scorer, instead relying on the trio of seniors Nate Caron and Hunter Bulis and freshman Vinny Oliveiri, with Kobey Imbert, Luke Brown and Jake Walkden also contributing. The defense is anchored by Mike Outor, with long stick middie Micah Brown putting together a strong season. They all play in front of the consistent, if not splashy, Matt Darling. “He’s made some great saves for us,” Nodelman said. “He’s coming into his own and he’s helped us control that defense and not gotten too worried about what’s happening. He doesn’t get rattled. He doesn’t get anxious. He’s very even-keeled.” The Lakers will have had nearly two weeks in between games by the time the first round rolls around, and they know they’d better be looking at their opponents’ record, not conference, if they hope to keep the train rolling. 
 Bishop Stang Spartans 
 Record: 11-6 
 Seed: No. 4 in Div. 3 South 
 Opening matchup: A first-round bye, then facing the winner of No. 5 Hull (11-7) and No. 12 Coyle-Cassidy (8-8) in the quarterfinals on June 7 
 Last postseason: Lost 17-1 to eventual state champion Cohasset in 2018 Div. 3 South semifinals 
 Outlook: A year ago, the Spartans won two playoff games, but they graduated eight seniors, watched Nolan DaRosa move to Texas and saw the program change coaches after a 15-win season. This year, they’re back and restocked with another strong senior class. Stang didn’t face Hull this season — they both lost to Silver Lake, by scores of 18-7 (Stang) and 15-7 (Hull) — but it swept Coyle-Cassidy, winning 14-7 on April 30 and 19-4 on April 9. The young Warriors, who like to slow the game down, feature a couple of strong, athletic defensemen, who gave the run-and-gun Spartans some trouble in their second matchup. A key for Stang will be sophomore Ben Gowell coming through in the face-off circle, because the Spartans’ conservative defense doesn’t create many turnovers. The offense is led by attackmen Caleb Ikkela and Bobby Jedrey and midfielder Tim Manley Jr. Junior Marcus Smalldone has been solid in net all year, but the biggest X factor for Stang could be how it handles the loss of three starting midfielders to injury. Without Justin Ajami, Connor Araujo and Graham Brown, the Spartans will be looking for Justin Hankins and Ryan Martin to step up as the bench will become short. The Spartans are looking to at least replicate last year’s semifinal appearance. 
 Dartmouth Indians 
 Seed: No. 9 in Div. 2 South 
 Opening matchup: Will play at No. 8 Falmouth (11-7) on Tuesday at 5 p.m. 
 Last postseason: Lost 14-4 to Scituate in 2018 Div. 2 South quarterfinals 
 Outlook: The Indians have some experience with Falmouth, dropping a 6-3 score to them on May 18. While Dartmouth played well on defense, its offense started slow and the only goals came from Owen Sherman, Max Goudreau and Ben Clark. Charlie Gamache made 14 saves. The biggest challenge will be slowing up the Penn State-bound Collin Almeida, who had scored 183 goals coming into his senior year. There’s a good chance one of Dartmouth’s long sticks, either Tyler Jacobsen or Logan Bosworth, gets the assignment and they’ll have Charlie Gamache, one of the state’s most talented goalies, as the last line of defense. That will be important against a hard-shooting Falmouth team. “If they get an open shot, they’re going to rip it,” coach Peter Crane said. “They’re a great team. Well coached. Very skilled. It’s going to be a challenge.” The most important question will be how much offense the Indians can generate. Without a go-to scorer, they’ve relied on the teamwork of Angelo Nicolosi, Owen Sherman, Ben Clark and, especially lately, senior midfielder Andrew Lens, who has been red-hot in his last three games. “We just have to move the ball on offense,” said coach Peter Crane. “We just have to run our offensive sets.” The Indians will be without senior midfielder Will Cote, who is out for the season, but hope to get Cadence Chase and Jacob Bessette back soon. 
 Fairhaven Blue Devils 
 Seed: No. 6 in Div. 3 South 
 Opening Matchup: Will host No. 11 St. John Paul (11-7) on Tuesday at 6 p.m. 
 Last postseason: Lost 11-3 to Cardinal Spellman in 2017 Div. 3 South first round 
 Outlook: The Blue Devils come into the postseason playing well, having won five of their last six, since an overtime loss to Old Rochester. The Blue Devils and St. John Paul shared a common opponent this season in Martha’s Vineyard, who the Blue Devils lost to 11-8, but the Lions lost to 16-3 and 14-5. After missing the playoffs for three straight years from 2014-2016, Fairhaven is now dancing for the second time in three seasons and has plenty of players on offense who picked up playoff experience two years ago, including leading scorer Ryan Lariviere, Greg Centeio, Flynn Bourgault, Drew Macomber and Colin Roderiques. Vital to the Blue Devils’ attack will be patience on offense, where they hope to run methodical sets and wait for the best shot, not the first shot. But coach Nick Pilla pointed to one thing that carries more importance for his Blue Devils than any other: Scooping up ground balls. Dylan Fonseca, Fairhaven’s face-off man, is one of its best at pickup up loose balls, with Larivier and Macomber also suited to the task. The biggest question marks for the Blue Devils come on defense, where seniors Jared Diggins and CJ Murphy have been gaining confidence in front of first-year goalie Luke Isaksen. “Last year they went through some growing pains and it was a big learning experience for them,” Pilla said of his defense. “This year, their experience has paid off. More confidence has allowed them to play to their physical ability.”

 PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris dueled Friday over Hispanic votes in California, a central front in the nation's immigration battle where Latinos represent the state's largest ethnic group. 
 As the nation's most populous state, California holds a trove of 2020 delegates that are being eagerly sought by Democratic presidential rivals. The appearance of the two prominent contenders at a forum organized by immigrant rights activists kicked off several days of intense campaigning in the state, which will culminate at a state Democratic convention in San Francisco where 14 candidates are scheduled to appear. 
 Harris elicited a burst of applause when she told the group that she was a proud daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, then promised that if elected she would work for comprehensive immigration reform in her first 100 days in office. 
 She also promised to end the ""hate-driven"" policies of the Trump administration, including the so-called travel ban. 
 ""This is a nation that was founded by immigrants,"" she said at one point. Any delay, she said, brings more human suffering when families are separated or treated unjustly. 
 Sanders took the stage to chants of ""Bernie, Bernie."" He opened his remarks by labeling President Donald Trump a ""racist"" who was trying to win re-election by dividing Americans by skin color and where they were born. 
 If elected, ""we are going to do exactly the opposite,"" Sanders said. 
 Americans, he said, want immigration reform and a path to citizenship for the millions of people who entered the U.S. illegally. 
 He promised to bring an administration to Washington that ""represents the needs of the working people of this country,"" not just the wealthy. 
 The Hispanic vote has become increasingly important in strongly Democratic California, particularly in a Democratic presidential primary. 
 California was once a reliably Republican state in presidential elections, but a surge in immigrants transformed the state and its voting patterns. The number of Hispanics, blacks and Asians combined has outnumbered whites in the state since 1998. Meanwhile, new voters, largely Latinos and Asians, lean Democratic. 
 The last Republican to carry the state in a presidential election was George H.W. Bush, in 1988. 
 The candidates each tacked to similar themes, including criticizing the Trump administration's immigration policies and enacting comprehensive reform. 
 However, candidates can expect a skeptical look from many voters, Latino and otherwise, who have heard promises from both parties for years about immigration reform that never arrived. 
 When asked how she would assure Hispanics that she wasn't another candidate with an empty promise, Harris told reporters, ""By pointing to my record"" as a senator and former state attorney general. 
 Sanders, too, said he would introduce a comprehensive immigration plan shortly after taking office. He also said he would expand an Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation. 
 ""This is a promise that will be kept,"" the Vermont senator said. 
 Lisa Luther, who attended a raucous Sanders rally earlier in the day at a nearby convention center, said she was confident the senator could deliver on immigration reform when other Democrats have failed. Luther, who once worked as a chef, said she has seen firsthand the struggles of immigrants who worked beside her. 
 Sanders ""will not let it fall by the wayside,"" she said. ""It's been so prevalent in ... his campaigns."" 
 Julian Castro, a former Obama administration housing secretary, spoke to the crowd about his Mexican heritage and argued that new immigrants are necessary to maintain economic vitality. That's especially important, he said, as Baby Boomers grow old and draw on Social Security. New workers mean more money to support the federal retirement system, he said. 
 Castro is one of two candidates in the crowded Democratic field that have released detailed, written policies addressing the future of the immigration system, as the issue has been overshadowed on the campaign trail by health care, gun violence and reproductive rights. 
 ""It would be economic suicide not to have them,"" he said of immigrants. 
 Democratic hopeful Jay Inslee, who has pledged to make combating climate change the top national priority, faulted Trump for ignoring a global warming crisis that is influencing immigration and creating ""climate migrants."" The Washington governor said at the forum Friday that a plan is needed to fight global warming while helping those driven from their homes by a changing climate. 
 The Trump administration has proposed its own overhaul that would bolster border security while creating a ""merit-based"" immigration system prioritizing people with in-demand job skills, rather than relatives of people already in the U.S. But that was largely seen as symbolic, and the president has repeatedly returned to his calls for extending the U.S.-Mexico border wall and imposing stricter immigration policies. 
 The forum was sponsored by the groups FIRM Action, Community Change Action and CHIRLA Action Fund.

 UK Border Force intercepts 74 migrants crossing Channel 
 By DANICA KIRKA Associated Press 
 Jun 1, 2019 
 Save 
 LONDON (AP) — Britain's Border Force intercepted 74 people Saturday, including minors, on eight vessels trying to cross the English Channel into Britain. Two further boats were stopped by French authorities. 
 The interceptions on an exceptionally sunny warm day will heighten concerns that improving weather will encourage smugglers to try their luck at bringing more migrants to the U.K. from France. 
 Authorities said that a criminal investigation was underway. The nationalities of the migrants were still being determined. Coastguard officials said the incidents stretched along Britain's southeast coast, from the port of Dover to Winchelsea Beach near Hastings, 50 miles (80 kilometers) away. 
 Home Secretary Sajid Javid vowed that he would work with French border authorities to halt this rise in people trafficking across the Channel. 
 ""Those who choose to make this dangerous journey across one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world are putting their lives in grave danger — and I will continue to do all I can to stop them,"" he said in a statement Saturday night. 
 Local lawmaker Charlie Elphicke suggested the numbers were unprecedented and demanded action. 
 ""This crisis was meant to have been dealt with at Christmas, yet numbers continue to rise,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""The Home Office needs to get a grip on this crisis."" 
 The reports about migrants using small boats to cross the English Channel to Britain are politically explosive, even though Britain has seen nowhere near the number of migrant sea crossings that have hit fellow European Union nations Spain, Italy and Greece. So far this year, over 21,300 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea into Europe, and at least 519 others have died trying, according to the International Organization for Migration. 
 In December last year, Javid declared a rise in migrant crossings to be a ""major incident."" He said Saturday that since then, two cutters have returned to U.K. waters from overseas and he has agreed upon a joint action plan to halt people smuggling with his French counterparts. 
 Officials have blamed the influx on smuggling gangs. 
 ""It is an established principle that those in need of protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach and since January, more than 30 people who arrived illegally in the U.K. in small boats have been returned to Europe,"" Javid said. ""We will continue to seek to return anyone who has entered the U.K. illegally."" 
 Overall, migration into Europe is down substantially since over 1 million asylum-seekers and migrants came to the continent in 2015, but the issue still resonates politically, including in the elections last week to the European Parliament.

 Marchers fill the sidewalk Saturday along Illinois Avenue in Carbondale for the Southern Illinois Pride Fest march. 
 Second SI Pride Fest embraces history, challenges facing the LGBTQIA+ community 
 Save 
 CARBONDALE — “I’m done going back,” Chip Loghry said Saturday, their voice crackling through a bullhorn. 
 Before the crowd of about 200 gathered marchers left the Gaia House in Carbondale, Loghry told the group “our history is a dance.” They said the LGBTQIA+ community takes two steps forward and one step back. 
 But, Loghry said they are done with that. 
 2nd annual Southern Illinois Pride Fest starts today 
 CARBONDALE — As temperatures rise, summer traditions return once more to remind us of our collective histories. One month before our nation ce… 
 Loghry, who identifies with the “they/them” pronoun set, is the vice chair of Carbondale’s Rainbow Cafe, a safe space for LGBTQIA+ youth and their allies and was addressing the marchers before this year’s Southern Illinois Pride Fest. The group was about to embark on a trip through the city’s downtown to end at the Town Square Pavilion where the weekend's festivities were centered. 
 Logghry told the crowd that “I want to grow old” but added that as people outside of the heterosexual, gender-conforming community, this is not always a guarantee. But still, Loghry said it’s their duty to do it anyway. 
 Keith Ortolana was the last speaker to address the group before they started their march. He reiterated Loghry’s tone of perseverance. 
 “Nothing will ever bring us to a full stop,” he said as he was met with cheers. 
 But, Ortolana asked a deep question of the group, too. Something that wasn’t the same for every person there, at least not exactly the same. 
 “What is pride, anyway?” 
 Roy Younger and his partner, Keith Parkhill, sat in the shade of the Town Square Pavilion after the march. The couple has been together for 27 years and admitted they have a lot of perspective on where the LGBTQIA+ community has come. 
 Parkhill remembers coming out in 1986 while he was in high school in McLeansboro. It was no easy task for him.

 “Back then it could be a very lonely life,” he said. 
 Younger had a slightly easier time. His uncle was out as gay, which gave him a role model — the family had already accepted Younger’s uncle which he said also made things easier on him. 
 Southern Illinois gears up for inaugural pride festival 
 CARBONDALE — LGBT pride is coming to Southern Illinois. 
 But then there was the rest of the world he had to deal with. Younger and Parkhill both recalled being in Carbondale when they had to go out in fear of being targeted with violence. They told stories of waiting for large groups to go into a restaurant or business so they wouldn’t be spotted going in together. All to avoid being beaten. 
 When asked what pride was to them, Parkhill spoke up. He said for him it was the push for everyone to be able to live the same life as heterosexual people. 
 The two men were quietly very satisfied with the party going on around them. No more were people as afraid of being out and proud while out in public, though all admitted the struggle to overcome fear and prejudice was far from over. 
 Austin Peppers walked his daughter in a stroller during Saturday’s festival. Peppers performs in drag and identifies as pansexual, a person who does not limit their attraction to a specific sex or gender identity. 
 The pride festival was especially meaningful to him as a father. He said regardless of who his daughter loves, he wants her to know “she has a community.” However, he admitted that he will be honest if she comes out as anything other than heterosexual: “It’s not easy being in the community.” 
 To Peppers, Pride encompassed the history of the modern gay rights movement, which is often cited as starting with the 1969 Stonewall riots, a series of violent clashes between gay Americans and New York Police. 
 Peppers said it is “taking what happened at Stonewall and not letting the hate get to you.” 
 All of this lines up with Ortolana said pride was. 
 “Pride, at its core, is whatever you make of it,” he said.

 MADRID (AP)  José Antonio Reyes, the former Spain midfielder who won five Europa League titles and was part of Arsenal's unbeaten ""Invincibles"" squad, has been killed in a traffic accident at the age of 35. 
 Sevilla and second-division club Extremadura, where Reyes played this past season, both confirmed the death on Saturday. 
 ""We couldn't be confirming worse news. Beloved Sevilla star José Antonio Reyes has died in a traffic collision. Rest in peace,"" Sevilla said on Twitter. 
 Reyes also played for Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid among other clubs in a professional career that spanned nearly 20 years, after making his debut for Sevilla as a 16-year-old. 
 He helped Arsenal go unbeaten through the 2003-04 season, scoring two crucial goals toward the end of the campaign to keep that record intact. He also won a Spanish league title with Real Madrid, and five Europa League crowns with Sevilla and Atletico Madrid. He also made 21 appearances for Spain between 2003-06. 
 ""I am devastated to hear the terrible news about Jose,"" former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said in a statement. ""To his family and friends, all support from everyone in the Arsenal family. He will remain forever in our hearts."" 
 Arsenal said it would fly the club flag at half mast at its training ground on Saturday. 
 Reyes' former Arsenal teammate Thierry Henry also said he was ""devastated"" by the news. 
 ""Wonderful player, superb team mate and exceptional human being,"" Henry wrote on Twitter. 
 Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos, who like Reyes came up through the youth ranks at Sevilla and played alongside him for Spain and Madrid, also expressed his sadness. 
 ""Broken. Shattered. I have no words,"" Ramos wrote in Spanish on Twitter. ""All the love to the family. We'll always remember you, friend! RIP brother."" 
 Because of the death, the Spanish football federation postponed the seven second-division matches that were scheduled to be played on Sunday.

 SAN DIEGO -- Francisco Mejía's balky left knee has healed, but the Padres' 23-year-old catcher is still probably at least 10 days from his return to the big league club.

 SAN DIEGO -- 
 Francisco Mejía 
 's balky left knee has healed, but the Padres' 23-year-old catcher is still probably at least 10 days from his return to the big league club. 
 After missing three weeks with a left knee sprain, Mejia was activated from the injured list on Saturday. But the club optioned him to Triple-A El Paso -- where he’s spent the past 12 days rehabbing -- to continue getting him regular starts. 
 In sporadic playing time behind starter 
 Austin Hedges 
 this season, Mejia was hitting just .167 with a .466 OPS before his early-May injury. The switch-hitting backstop has a high-upside bat, but he hasn't put it together in the big leagues yet. 
 ""In Franky's case: Go play baseball consistently, work through some things offensively and defensively,"" said Padres skipper Andy Green. ""He's done some nice things down there. We want him to continue to work on those things. We fully expect to see him here in the near future."" 
 In eight rehab appearances, Mejia was batting .391/.414/.652. The Padres insist they don't put much stock into those numbers, given the nature of the Pacific Coast League -- and El Paso in particular -- as a hitter's paradise. 
 ""We know specifically what we're looking for, and it has very little to do with the slash line right now,"" Green said. ""It has a lot more to do with the way the game's being played, and things we're looking for that are important to us that we'll keep internal. ... The slash line, for us, doesn't matter a ton."" 
 If Mejia continues to rake, however, there might be a place for him to receive more playing time in the big leagues. Hedges has been arguably been the game’s best defensive catcher this season, but he's done very little at the plate. 
 Right now, it's clear the club still views Hedges as the everyday catcher, prompting Saturday’s decision to option Mejia. 
 Technically, the Padres didn't need to make that decision for another week. But by optioning him Saturday, they ensured that he'd be eligible to return in 10 days. If there's an injury in that span, however, Mejia could be recalled at any time. 
 Noteworthy 
 • For the first time since 
 Josh Naylor 
 's promotion to the big leagues last week, the Padres opted for an outfield alignment with Naylor in left, Wil Myers in center and Franmil Reyes in right. Suffice it to say, they're sacrificing quite a bit defensively with that group. 
 Hunter Renfroe, the team leader in OPS, received the night off after homering on Friday -- a testament to the team's desire to let the rookie Naylor play against right-handed pitching. 
 ""As long as Josh is here, we're committed to getting him some measure of consistent at-bats,"" Green said. ""We trust his bat, we believe he's going to hit for us, we believe he's going to be a real big league hitter. The only real way to see that is to write his name in the lineup and let him play baseball."" 
 Naylor came through for his manager Saturday night by hitting his first big league home run off Miami starter Jose Urena. 
 • To clear space on the roster for Saturday starter Nick Margevicius, the Padres optioned right-hander 
 Phil Maton 
 to Triple-A. Maton has allowed runs in three of his last four outings, and he did so without recording an out in the last two. 
 • Catcher Chris Stewart exercised his opt-out, and he was let go by El Paso on Saturday. The veteran backstop signed a Minors deal in the offseason with an opt-out if he hadn't been rostered by June 1. He was hitting .277/.333/.354 with El Paso, but he didn't figure to have a path to playing time with Hedges, Mejia and Austin Allen in his way.

 PHOENIX — Approximately 250 to 300 gallons of fuel were spilled at a Circle K located near 26th Avenue and Camelback Road when a fuel tank collapsed, according to the Phoenix Fire Department. 
 The manager of the Circle K told the Phoenix Fire Department that the fuel tanks at this Circle K location were being cleaned by a vacuum ""when a pressure relief valve failed, causing the tank on the vacuum truck to collapse and the fuel to spill."" 
 First responders believe approximately 250 to 300 gallons of gasoline spilled due to the collapse. 
 The Circle K was evacuated around 9 a.m., and will remain closed for approximately four hours while cleanup efforts continue, according to Phoenix fire. 
 The Phoenix Police Department  shut down traffic in the area of 27th Avenue and Camelback Road, as well as the southbound and northbound ramps of I-17 at Camelback, and westbound Camelback at I-17 when the initial spill occurred.

 51 min ago 
 Print 
 BEIRUT (AP) — Syrian opposition activists are reporting that two explosions killed 10 people in the northern city of Raqqa. 
 The Saturday night blasts occurred in two different locations in the city that was once the de facto capital of the Islamic State group. 
 The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the first blast was a roadside bomb in the city center. It said the second blast was carried out by a suicide attacker driving a vehicle at a checkpoint of U.S.-backed fighters in the central Naim Square, killing five fighters and five civilians. 
 The Sound and Pictures activist collective that covers IS atrocities said 10 people were killed in Naim square. 
 Blasts have occurred since U.S.-baked fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces captured Raqqa in October 2017.

 Beijing will fight to the end to protect its national interests both economically, amid the trade war with the US, and militarily, if any outside force dares to challenge the One China policy and split Taiwan from the mainland. 
 The People’s Liberation Army will have no choice but to protect Taiwan at all costs should the US or any other outside force dare to split the island from the mainland, Defense Minister Wei Fenghe told delegates of the Shangri-La Dialogue security summit, a day after his American counterpart tried to muster an international coalition against China’s growing might in the Indo-Pacific. 
 ""No attempts to split China will succeed,"" the defense chief said. ""Any interference in the Taiwan question is doomed to failure."" 
 China must be and will be reunited 
 Stressing that China will not yield a “single inch” of its “sacred land,” the minister said the PLA serves “entirely for self-defense” and will only strike back if attacked. 
 Some countries from outside the region come to the South China Sea to flex muscles in the name of freedom of navigation. 
 While the threat of a wider conflict indeed hangs over the Pacific, Wei stressed that China and Washington are fully aware that war would spell “disaster” for both. Beijing is firmly committed to regional peace and stability and will never pursue expansionist policies, he said.",1

 Our Correspondent 
 Mandi Ahmedgarh, May 31 
 Constituents of various health, government, social and educational organisations vowed to associate with the crusade launched against smoking and tobacco consumption. 
 An oath was taken in response to the call made by Ahmedgarh SDM Vikramjeet Singh Panthey and Civil Hospital SMO Dr Pratibha Sahu Verma to observe World No-Tobacco Day. 
 The crusaders vowed that they would not consume tobacco or tobacco product in any form and would help their addicted acquaintances shun the habit. 
 Pardeep Sood, convener of the event, said constituents of government offices, educational institutes and social organisations of the town and surrounding localities had taken a pledge on the subject, prescribed by the State Health Department. 
 Responding to a call given by the civil and health authorities, office-bearers and activists of various organisations led by president of the Municipal Council, Suraaj Mohammad organised seminars, workshops and competitions at various venues today. 
 Speakers highlighted the ill-effects of active and passive smoking on human health, besides its affects on the animal life. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including emphysema, chronic bronchitis and refractory asthma were cited to be most common adverse effects of smoking. 
 “While smokers are 12 to 13 times more likely to be affected by COPD, curative and preventive treatment of general physiological disorders is hindered in case of smokers,” Dr Sunit Hind, former president of Rotary Club, Ahmedgarh, said. 
 In another function held at MGMN Senior Secondary School office, activists of the All-Banks Retirees Forum resolved to help at least one smoker to shun the habit. 
 Amar Nath Verma and Kedar Nath Kapila, president and convener of the outfit, declared to recognise motivators and beneficiaries during the next regular meeting of the forum.",1

 Nigel Farage has accused Downing Street of being ""petty"" and ""small minded"" after he was allegedly banned from meeting Donald Trump next week. 
 The Brexit Party leader said Number 10 had told the US president's team not to meet him during his state visit - a move he branded ""absolutely ludicrous"". 
 Mr Farage said that a friend in Washington had informed him that Theresa May's office had told Mr Trump's entourage: ""Don't meet this guy.""

 ""It's just extraordinary, it's small minded, petty and it's not putting the interests of the country first.""

 BOARDMAN, Ohio (WKBN) - Several stores at the east end of the Boardman Plaza continued their clean-up Friday after floodwaters inundated their buildings Tuesday evening. 
 The stretch of Route 224 between Market Street and West Boulevard looked like a lake earlier this week. High water covered the road and the plaza's parking lot. 
 Most of the buildings east of Save-A-Lot had water inside. 
 WATCH: Boardman Plaza along Route 224 underwater 
 ServPro trucks were scattered throughout the parking lot, cleaning up the damage. 
 A sign outside of Save-A-Lot Friday said the store is temporarily closed for water damage. Inside, there is only shelving without products. 
 The Ohio Means Jobs location in the plaza needs more time to clean up. It will be closed through Tuesday. You can still use the Oakhill Satellite location or the Columbiana County location in Lisbon. 
 The 17th fairway on the south course was underwater Wednesday. The entire course, north and south, was closed. 
 On Friday, the tree across 17 was still down, but it will be gone Saturday. 
 Director of Golf Brian Tolnar said the north course will be open Saturday morning and the south by Sunday afternoon, cart path only.

100551,"Jam Central Station: Electric Forest 2019 Preview 
 June 1, 2019 | Posted by Jeff Modzelewski 
 Tweet 
 In my time going to music festivals and following the jam band scene, there has been one constant.  The Double JJ Ranch and Resort in Rothbury, Michigan.  From my first festival at Rothbury 2008 to today, this location has been the center of my annual musical life.  I’ve met great friends, seen unbelievable live performances, and had more fun than I ever thought possible.  As Electric Forest has continued to evolve I’ve at times wondered if I, as a nearly 40 year old, would continue to fit in with the much younger demographic and the electronic music that dominates the festival.  Every year I go back and realize that I had nothing to fear.  Electric Forest positions itself as a melting pot, straddling the lines between genres, between a music festival and an artistic event, and they continue to have a place for everybody. 
 The 2019 version of Electric Forest is bringing in some changes.  After expanding to 2 weekends to accommodate the ever-growing crowd, the festival contracted to just 1 event in 2019 as a way to be good stewards of the beautiful land that they’re on.  This was put out as a way to allow improvements to be made to the venue and preservation work to be done on Sherwood Forest, the heart of the fest.  Not surprisingly, this led to the festival selling out very quickly, as had been the norm prior to the festival moving to two weekends.  This isn’t the only change, however.  Electric Forest has also instituted a “Carpool Challenge,” a new podcast, new camping options, and even award-winning short films to celebrate the annual event.  Far from resting on their laurels, Electric Forest continues to grow and evolve every year. 
 So what can attendees expect in 2019?  First off, a lineup that is, as usual, pretty stacked.  The String Cheese Incident will be performing 3 full shows at the festival.  Bassnectar will also be playing his annual headlining set.  Other headliners include Odesza, Kygo, and Zed’s Dead.  While the lineup clearly trends young and electronic, there’s plenty to enjoy for jam fans including Lettuce, STS9, Twiddle, Ghost Light, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades, Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, Southern Ave (a highlight for me from a few years back), Spafford, TAUK, and many others.  With so many things happening at Sherwood Forest and plenty of great jam, funk, and bluegrass artists on the bill, it’s not hard for anyone to put together a schedule that works for the Forest. 
 So what else makes Electric Forest so special?  The sheer size of the event, for starters.  9 stages (at least) ranging from your typical festival stages to EDM-specific spots to interactive comedy areas to performance clubs.  Artists have the opportunity to interact with fans in many different ways and perform in settings they don’t normally see, especially in large festival settings.  The forest itself has been talked about for years, but what the festival does with this space is amazing.  The performance art, the interactive exhibits, and all of the little touches show an attention to detail that isn’t found anywhere else.  The fact that this event has been so successful has allowed the producers to try new things and branch out, which in turn makes the event even more exciting every single year.  I’m excited to see what’s new in the Forest for 2019, and, even though it’s back down to one weekend I don’t expect the event to be any less spectacular. 
 With the festival selling out so quickly, tickets are a little pricey to come by at this point.  But they are available.  You can expect to spend $100-$200 over face value at this point, but for those desperate to attend you can get in the door.  The fest usually releases a handful of tickets closer to the date as well, as folks who were on a payment plan sometimes don’t make their payments, making those tickets available to the public.  But I’ve said before and I’ll continue to say that, if you want to go to Electric Forest you really need to get your tickets as soon as they go on sale. 
 Finally, one of the things I love most about Electric Forest is how these divergent communities come together.  There were some struggles early on as the jam fans and the EDM fans figured out how to coexist.  Jam fans upset at losing “their” Rothbury festival.  EDM fans used to camping at the rail for sets all day, making it hard for the jam fans to enjoy some of their favorite bands.  Over the past few years almost all of those conflicts have been resolved.  These two scenes coexist remarkably well at Electric Forest, and bonds are often formed across these cultures.  Over the years Electric Forest has become a new thing, something for everyone to enjoy, and it’s a culture that they’ve intentionally cultivated through programs to make the event as open and accepting as possible.  After so many great Forest experiences I expect to have another amazing weekend at one of my favorite places in the world, and I can’t wait to get back.

 It's been less than a month since the ""Game of Thrones"" series finale aired, but that doesn't mean fans are ready to say goodbye completely. For those looking to stay in Westeros a little while longer, you're in luck — Cruise Croatia is offering a ""Game of Thrones"" cruise that takes fans to some of the iconic locations of the Seven Kingdoms. 
 But you'll have to act fast to snag a seat. There are only 38 spots available for the eight-day cruise that departs Aug. 8, 2020. 
 The cruise will take passengers to spots like Bakar Fortress and the Pile Gate in the Croation city of Dubrovnik, which fans will recognize as King's Landing, and Klis Fortress, where Daenerys conquered Meereen. You'll also get to attend a ""Game of Thrones"" farewell party on the cruise's final night. 
 A ticket will run you at least $1,895, but you can enter a contest to win a spot for you and three friends — just tell Cruise Croatia which ""Game of Thrones"" characters the four of you are most like.

 Delaware Mom Opens Up After She Says She Was Brutally Attacked While Vacationing At Caribbean Resort 
 June 1, 2019 
 (TODAY) – A Delaware woman who said she was brutally attacked and left for dead while vacationing at a Dominican Republic resort is sharing her story to caution others against letting their guard down, even in so-called paradise. 
 “I just remember, thinking at that point, I wasn’t going to make it home to see my boys and my husband. That they weren’t going to find me,” Tammy Lawrence-Daley told NBC News about what was going through her head during the alleged attack in January. “And I remember that last breath I took and then I just went unconscious.” 
 The Delaware mother said the attack occurred on the second night of a vacation she and her husband took with some friends at the Majestic Elegance Punta Cana resort, a five-star resort on the east end of the Caribbean island. 
 Lawrence-Daley said she headed out around 10:30 one evening to get a snack. As she walked through a rotunda between the buildings, she said she heard heavy footsteps behind her. Someone then grabbed her and pulled her into a maintenance room, where she said she was savagely beaten and choked. 
 Lawrence-Daley recalled fighting back “with everything I had,” but was overpowered. 
 She regained consciousness shortly later to find her attacker “beating me and kicking me in the head.” 
 The attack continued for hours, she said. 
 “I have no idea what he did to me. I just knew I was in this pit and I couldn’t get out because I couldn’t see,” she said. 
 Lawrence-Daley said she did catch a glimpse of her attacker’s clothing and saw he was wearing a uniform with the resort’s logo. 
 “I just knew I was dead,” she said. “The rage coming off of this man, you could feel it, it was palpable.” 
 Eventually, her attacker dragged her into a basement crawl space and left her for dead, she said. 
 Hotel workers found Lawrence-Daley eight hours later. 
 Her husband, Chris Daley, said he barely recognized his wife. 
 Tammy Lawrence-Daley after her attack at the Majestic Elegance Punta Cana resort in the Dominican Republic. TODAY 
 “It didn’t look like her. She was bruised. Eyes were shut swollen,” he said. “And I just lost it, yelling for people to get help.” 
 Lawrence-Daley spent five days in the hospital. But she said returning home to face her family was another painful part of the trauma. 
 She later shared her ordeal along with graphic photos of herself after the attack in a lengthy  Facebook post . 
 “How do you explain to your kids you were almost killed by some random stranger and that ‘Mommy is coming home, but I don’t look like myself’?” she wrote. “How do you look into your parents eyes as they gaze upon your battered face telling them, ‘I’m okay, I’ll be okay.'” 
 Lawrence-Daley said Dominican Republic authorities have not made an arrest. 
 “This man thought he killed me, but he failed,” she wrote on Facebook. “He is still out there, a predator, waiting for his next victim. Only the next woman may not be so fortunate. Please, please do not walk alone.” 
 NBC News has reached out for comment to police and the Majestic Elegance Resort but has not received a response. 
 “Even though you think you’re sitting in paradise and thinking you’re safe, you’re really not,” Lawrence-Daley told NBC News.

 Gavin Newsom invites women to have abortions performed in California 
 1  /  12 
 Back to Gallery 
 California Gov. Gavin Newsom is welcoming women across the country who are seeking abortions to come have the procedure done in his home state. 
 In a Friday letter , Newsom joined Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee in urging states ""to review their laws and enact their own protections"" after states such as Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Mississippi recently passed stringent laws that would curb access to abortion. 
 ""In the absence of federal leadership on this issue, states must step up and put in place their own protections – both in statute and in their state constitutions, and through the expansion of family planning and education – to defend every American's right to reproductive freedom,"" the governors wrote. ""Roe is settled law, but newly enacted and clearly unconstitutional laws in a handful of states compel our states to act now to reaffirm longstanding commitments to safeguard the fundamental rights of women."" 
 ALSO:  Judge says Missouri clinic can keep providing abortions 
 Newsom took it a step further, inviting women in conservative states to come to California to ""fully exercise their reproductive rights."" 
 ""Today, we issued a California Proclamation on Reproductive Freedom, reaffirming our commitment to protecting women's reproductive choices, educating Californians about their rights to reproductive freedom, welcoming women to California to fully exercise their reproductive rights, and acting as a model for other states that want to ensure full reproductive freedom for women,"" the letter reads. 
 Newsom isn't the only California lawmaker taking aim at states passing new abortion laws. 
 Presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.)  unveiled a proposal on the campaign trail that would require states to receive federal approval before changing abortion laws. 
 RELATED:  Nebraska lawmakers approve abortion drug notice bill 
 ""We are living through an all-out assault being waged on women's health and reproductive rights,"" Harris wrote on her campaign website. ""From Alabama to Ohio, and Missouri to Georgia, the goal of Republican politicians is clear: Overturn Roe v. Wade and end safe and legal abortion in America."" 
 Under her proposal, states that have a history of of limiting access to abortion would have to receive clearance from the Justice Department before implementing new laws on reproductive care.

 Apple Is Pulling The Plug On iTunes After 18 Years 
 Apple is finally putting to rest the program that started a “music revolution.” iTunes, which helped usher in the mp3 era of music, will shutter after nearly two decades.

This development has been rumored for years, as subscription-based streaming services — including the company’s own Apple Music — have overtaken music downloads.

 Yu Chun Christopher Wong/S3studio/Getty Images Over the last few years, the way we consume music has drastically changed. Instead of purchasing albums, many people choose to pay for a subscription to a music streaming platform where they can listen to pretty well anything they want for a fixed cost. This has led to lower physical sales for albums, with streaming numbers accounting for the vast majority of album sales. For those who did purchase and download music, iTunes became a necessary application as it allowed you to sort and organize your music library. Well, if you had an attachment ...

 Among their many supposed sins, the Democrats are accused of hiding  their 19th-century racist past,  not doing enough  to back Benjamin Netanyahu and the Likud coalition in Israel , refusing  to spend money on charter schools  that help racial minorities in cities that are run by Democrats, and, most recently, ignoring the  racial insensitivity of Democratic officials  in Virginia who once wore blackface.

 Republicans also never tire of telling us how Democrats  hurt women  by misconstruing the feminist movement, which they understand better than the Left. Moreover, Democratic mayors in New York, Chicago, Baltimore, and so on have been guilty of “using” black voters but then doing nothing for them. On Fox News and in Republican newspapers, we see garbage and drug needles piling up in Democratic-run cities. The residents of these places are never seen as complicit in these problems but are depicted as the pitiful victims of the Democrats they vote for. 
 Perhaps it’s time to see the relationship of Democratic voters to their party in an entirely different light. We should take into account friend-enemy relations, a reality that the Democratic leadership understands all too well. Millions of people vote on the basis of what they dislike and fear, and most of them are found on the Democratic side. No matter how many movies Dinesh D’Souza produces depicting Democrats as the party of slaveowners, most black voters are not about to change their voting habits on this basis. Instead black leaders denounce Republicans as tightwads who are insensitive to the financial demands they make on behalf of their communities. Republicans are also the party of white evangelicals, whom blacks may associate with past discrimination. No one is saying these stereotypes are fair. But they exist as a critical variable, which is not likely to go away, even if black neighborhoods are piled high with trash and full of crime under Democratic leadership.",1

 The Associated Press, Istanbul Saturday, 1 June 2019 
 Text size A A A 
 Ankara and Moscow are again facing an escalation of violence in Syria’s last rebel-held territory, a development that puts their cooperation to the test even as they support opposing sides in the eight-year war that has devastated Syria. 
 An all-out offensive by Syrian government forces to capture Idlib in northwestern Syria from insurgents could unleash an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, for the area is home to three million people. 
 Turkey, which is already hosting more than 3.6 million Syrian refugees, is facing strong pressure from Syria, Iran and Russia to deliver on its pledge to control the armed rebel factions in Idlib. 
 But Turkey also needs Russia to rein in Syrian President Bashar Assad to prevent a massive outflow of refugees and to keep Turkish soldiers on the ground safe. 
 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin “have an incentive to cooperate and ensure that nobody’s interests are totally trampled,” says Aaron Stein, the director of the Middle East program in American think-tank Foreign Policy Research Institute. 
 In September, the two leaders brokered a cease-fire for Idlib in the Russian resort of Sochi, preventing a bloody onslaught, despite the fact that Russia has firmly backed Assad and Turkey supports opposition forces. Nine months later, the truce has failed. 
 The agreement called for a 15-to-20 kilometer demilitarized zone free of insurgents and heavy weaponry and for two key highways crossing through Idlib to be reopened. The demilitarized zone has been breached and the highways are at the center of the current government offensive. 
 Syrian ground forces have been advancing from the south of the rebel stronghold under the cover of Syrian and Russian airstrikes. 
 Turkey has accused the Syrian government of violating the cease-fire and Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said the country has told Russia “the regime must be controlled.” 
 Russia has launched airstrikes in Idlib and is providing air cover in the Syrian government offensive. It has complained that the militants have increasingly been targeting its military base in the nearby coastal province of Latakia. 
 Russian-Turkish relations 
 But for now, Moscow is unlikely to support an all-out Syrian operation in Idlib because the benefits of a long-term alliance with Turkey outweigh one military battle. 
 “Russia doesn’t want to ruin its relationship with Turkey because of Idlib,” says Kirill Semenov, a Moscow-based Middle East analyst and expert at the Russian International Affairs Council. 
 In late April, Putin said he would not rule out a large-scale assault but “together with our Syrian friends, we believe that this would not be advisable” due to humanitarian issues. 
 Still, Russia’s patience is wearing thin with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which it accuses of targeting its military base. HTS is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Russia and Turkey, despite its claims it has disassociated from al-Qaeda. 
 Despite the cease-fire deal, Turkey has been unable to neutralize the extremists. Much of Idlib has come under the control of HTS, which has defeated Turkey-backed armed groups. 
 Erdogan and Putin have talked on the phone, agreeing to continue working along the lines of the cease-fire agreement to prevent civilian deaths and a refugee flow. They also agreed to meet on the sidelines of next month’s Group of 20 conference in Japan. 
 The presidents have become close since 2016, rebuilding their relations after a dramatic crisis in 2015 when Turkey shot down a Russian jet near the Syrian border. Their rapport comes amid Turkey’s fragile relations with NATO ally United States, especially over Washington’s support of Syrian Kurdish-led forces who control large swaths in eastern Syria. Ankara considers them an extension of a Kurdish insurgency operating inside Turkey. 
 Erdogan is so far sticking to his promise to buy Russian-made S-400 missiles despite US warnings the system would jeopardize Turkey’s participation in the F-35 fighter jet program and compromise its safety. 
 Turkey is also talking with the US about a safe zone in northeastern Syria and has repeatedly asked for the US to end its military support for Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. Erdogan will meet US President Donald Trump at the G-20 as well.",1
2093,"Record floods breach Arkansas levee, overtop 2 in Missouri 
  
 Friday 
 May 31, 2019 at 8:59 PM 
 Relentless flooding in the central U.S. inundated communities and damaged or spilled over levees on three major rivers in two states, and authorities discovered the body of a drowning victim at a Missouri lake. 
 LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Relentless flooding in the central U.S. on Friday inundated communities and damaged or spilled over levees on three major rivers in two states, and authorities discovered the body of a drowning victim at a Missouri lake. 
 The fast-flowing Arkansas River smashed a 40-foot hole in a levee in rural western Arkansas, causing water to spill into a nearby community. In northeast Missouri, a levee was overtopped on the Mississippi River, and another levee was topped on the Missouri River in the central part of the state. 
 The flooding has been building for days because of heavy rainfall upstream. In Arkansas, officials were warning of more potential problems on an already strained levee system. 
 ""These levees were not built to sustain this high a flow for this long, and we are seeing problems and there more than likely will be more,"" said Laurie Driver, spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Little Rock District. 
 In eastern Missouri, the state Highway Patrol's Water Division reported that the body of 57-year-old Lane Panasuk, of Butte, Montana, was recovered Thursday evening from Harry S. Truman Lake in Henry County, but the patrol said it did not know why he was in the water. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had warned visitors about high water levels that had closed most of the campgrounds around the lake and a road over its dam. 
 In Arkansas, the levee breached at Dardanelle, about 60 miles northwest of Little Rock. Yell County officials had anticipated the breach and urged residents in the nearby Holla Bend area to evacuate Thursday. 
 The Arkansas Department of Emergency Management said crews went door to door to recommend evacuation for about 160 homes. 
 Yell County Emergency Manager Jeff Gilkey told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that rapid currents from the river ripped a 40-foot section from the levee. Aerial video posted by the sheriff's office Friday showed water pouring through the hole. 
 ""There was nothing we could do to stop it,"" Gilkey said. 
 National Weather Service data showed a dip in the water level at Dardanelle, likely due to the breach. A flash flood warning was issued early Friday for the area, and forecasters said residents should be prepared for rapidly rising water. Local officials said they were uncertain where the water would end up. 
 ""Water is going to do what it wants to do,"" Yell County Judge Mark Thone told reporters at a news conference. ""We're just trying to head this off."" 
 The levee breached because of ongoing flooding along the Arkansas River, which began in Oklahoma. Late Thursday night, President Donald Trump approved the Arkansas request for a disaster declaration in 16 counties affected by the flooding. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the declaration will help the state minimize the loss, but added that ""this is far from over."" 
 Hutchinson said emergency officials were working on getting ahead of the flooding as it continues southeast, trying to identify and strengthen any other pressure points or weak spots in the levee system. 
 ""Obviously the breach in Dardanelle is a sign that there could be more of these breaches that will happen as pressure continues to mount in the coming days,"" Hutchinson said. 
 Entergy Arkansas said Friday that it does not anticipate any impact to its nuclear plant near the Arkansas River in Russellville. 
 In Fort Smith, the state's second-largest city, the river levels held steady at above-record levels Friday. Officials there said they wouldn't know the extent of the damage until the water receded, which could take days, if not longer. 
 Officials in Missouri issued a mandatory evacuation order for some residents of Howard County, where the Missouri River topped a levee. County Emergency Management Co-Director Bill John said the levee near Petersburg was expected to fail soon, KRCG reported. Levees in Lewis County along the Mississippi River in northeast Missouri were overtopped Thursday, flooding several thousand acres of farmland. Lewis County Emergency Director David Keith said no homes or businesses were impacted. 
 In northeastern Oklahoma, residents forced from their homes by flooding made plans to return as the river recedes. The National Weather Service said Friday the Arkansas River's level at Tulsa has dropped almost 4 feet from Wednesday's crest and will continue to recede through the weekend. Forecasters say river levels were also dropping in Muskogee, Oklahoma, about 45 miles southeast of Tulsa. 
 Earlier this year, about two dozen levee systems were breached or overtopped during Missouri River flooding that devastated parts of Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri.

 April report shows market resurgence continues

 Closed sales during April in the Naples housing market increased 12.8 percent to 1,158 properties in April 2019 from 1,027 properties in April 2018. Broker analysts reviewing the April 2019 Market Report released by the Naples Area Board of REALTORS® (NABOR®), which tracks home listings and sales within Collier County (excluding Marco Island), reported that April was a solid month with strong sales activity in both the single-family and condominium markets. 
 An uptick in showings during the last few months are a positive indicator of continued buyer interest in our area. April’s overall median closed price decreased 5.6 percent to $340,000 in April 2019 from $360,000 in April 2018, April 2019’s median closed price was higher than both January and February’s median closed prices. 
 The Report also showed nearly 1,000 properties went from active to either terminated, expired, or withdrawn in the Southwest Florida MLS during April, which directly impacted April’s ending inventory level as seen in an 11.1 percent decrease to 6,435 properties in April 2019 from 7,239 properties in April 2018. April saw the number of new condominium listings increase by 9.2 percent; whereas there was a decrease of 3.2 percent for new listings in the single-family homes market. 
 Unlike last year, April’s Report this year shows signs of a possible new trend: more closed sales for homes on the lower end of the price spectrum versus last year which had more closed sales in higher price points. 
 Closed sales of single-family homes in April 2019 increased 4.4 percent, but closed sales of condominiums increased 20.1 percent in April 2019 compared to April 2018 market statistics. Further, the trend toward more sales of lower priced properties is also visible in activity tracked over the last 12 months where there was a 4.3 percent increase or 2,727 closed sales of condominiums in the under $300,000 price category compared to a .8 percent decrease in this same price category for single-family homes (1,037 closed sales). The increase in condominium inventory Zorn mentioned is also a contributing factor to this new trend.

 The Latest: Sanders boasts of his anti-war record 
 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The Latest on the Democratic presidential candidates (all times local): 
 1:47 p.m. 
 Sen. Bernie Sanders is best known for railing against billionaires. But at an event run by a Democratic activist group he said he wanted to focus today on ending wars. 
 The Big Ideas forum is run by the liberal group MoveOn and eight Democratic presidential hopefuls came Saturday to describe one big idea. Sanders made his ""the need to stop endless wars and to bring the world together."" 
 He said he was proud to have opposed the Vietnam and Iraq wars and of trying to end the U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's military intervention in Yemen. He warned that, in the Trump administration, ""some of the same people that got us into the war in Iraq trying to start a military intervention in Iran."" 
 ___ 
 12:05 p.m. 
 Sen. Elizabeth Warren has taken a thinly veiled shot at one of her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
 Warren didn't name former Vice President Joe Biden in her speech at the California Democratic convention in San Francisco. But it was clear she was targeting the Democratic frontrunner, who's expressed hope the Republicans will have ""an epiphany"" after President Donald Trump is gone and will work with Democrats. 
 Warren told the cheering crowd that ""Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses. But our country is in a crisis. The time for small ideas is over."" 
 Warren followed former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who began his speech in Spanish and touted his ability last year to make Texas' Senate race competitive. 
 ___ 
 11:50 a.m. 
 California Sen. Kamala Harris has kicked off a 14-candidate marathon of 2020 Democratic hopefuls in San Francisco by calling for President Donald Trump's impeachment. 
 Harris is a former San Francisco district attorney who got the prime first speaking slot as California Democrats meet for their annual convention on Saturday. 
 Her campaign tried to demonstrate its support in the nation's biggest state by handing out multilingual placards to the crowd and emblazoning official convention lanyards with her name. 
 Harris in her seven-minute speech spoke about the need to fight back against Trump. She ended by saying: ""We need to begin impeachment proceedings and we need a new commander in chief!"" 
 Earlier, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi avoided mentioning impeachment but said the House would hold Trump accountable. 
 ___ 
 10:40 a.m. 
 More than a dozen Democratic presidential hopefuls have flocked to California for the chance to make their cases to thousands of activists in the nation's largest liberal stronghold. 
 Candidates held rallies across the state before descending on San Francisco for a three-day gathering of the California Democratic Party. 
 Home-state Sen. Kamala Harris is looking to make a show of force while Sen. Bernie Sanders hopes to build on the fervent support he received in California during his 2016 White House run. 
 Twelve others in the 2020 pack want to introduce themselves and spark interest among the party's most faithful voters. 
 Among the major contenders seeking to challenge President Donald Trump, only former Vice President Joe Biden declined to attend the California convention. He was scheduled to speak at a Human Rights Campaign event in Ohio on Saturday night.",1

 Farmers take corporate route to keep onion prices steady 
 Also in this section 
 Tribune News Service 
 Mumbai, May 31 
 Fluctuating prices of onions which alternatively leave farmers and consumers in tears may soon be a thing of the past as the government has teamed up with cultivators’ companies to buy their stock during surplus for release during lean periods. 
 Under a joint venture between the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED) and Maha-FPC — the apex body of farmer producer companies — in the state, 50,000 tonnes of onion are being purchased from farmers which will form part of the buffer stock being built by government. The onions will be released during the lean season when supplies dry up and prices begin to soar. 
 According to NAFED officials, storage and marketing infrastructure for onions is being constructed with funding from the government. “Cold storage and sorting facilities are being set up in Nashik, Pune and other onion growing areas,” according to Nana Patil, chairman, NAFED. 
 The initial corpus of Rs 25 crore is being shared equally by the government and farmer producer companies, according to Patil. 
 The MahaOnion project, which got to a small start last year, is being expanded and will cover most onion-growing areas in Maharashtra like Ahmednagar, Osmanabad and Aurangabad, according to NAFED. 
 In the past, the agency used to procure onions from the mandis of Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon. However, following the change in Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee rules by the Maharashtra government, farmer producer companies can bypass the APMCs and sell directly to NAFED. 
 “Under the MahaOnion project we purchase, sort and grade onions which are then sent for storage,” says Yogesh Thorat, managing director, Maha-FPC. The joint venture hit the headlines after it provided jobs to several thousand farmers in the drought-hit areas for sorting and grading onions. Thorat says the MahOnion project helped curtail the monopoly of traders who have a stranglehold on the onion trade. 
 Sources say farmers who sold their produce to the joint venture earned a decent Rs 933 per quintal just weeks after wholesale onion procurement prices crashed to less than one rupee per kilo in the Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon mandis. Though the amount of onions processed under the MahaOnion project is a tiny fraction of the total crop produced in Maharashtra, the state government expects to grow in the coming years. 
 Creating buffer stock 
 Under a joint venture between NAFED and Maha-FPC — the apex body of farmer producer companies — in Maharashtra, 50,000 tonnes of onion are being purchased from farmers which will form part of the buffer stock being built by government 
 The onions will be released during the lean season when supplies dry up and prices begin to soar 
 According to NAFED officials, storage and marketing infrastructure for onions is being constructed with funding from the government",1

 Welcome to “ TV Take ,” Variety’s television podcast. In this week’s episode, Variety executive TV editor Daniel Holloway chats with “ Good Omens ” showrunner Neil Gaiman . 
 The television version of “ Good Omens ” was a long time in the making. Multiple attempts at screen adaptations of the novel — about an angel and demon working to stave off the end of the word — were made shortly after its 1990 publication. None, however, got off the ground until the new six-episode miniseries, which premieres May 31 on Amazon. Gaiman, who wrote the novel with Terry Pratchett, exec produced and served as showrunner on the program. 
 Back in the 1980s, Gaiman had written the beginning of the novel — his first attempt at the form — and sent it to a few friends, Pratchett included, for feedback. Then, as he put it, “life got in the way,” and he set the project aside. Some time later, he was just a few issues into his much-loved comic-book series “Sandman,” when Pratchett reached out to him. 
 “I get a call from Terry saying, ‘You know, that thing you sent me — are you doing anything with it? Because I know how it goes. You can either sell me the idea and what you’ve written so far, or let’s write it together,'” Gaiman said. “And I’m like, ‘Let’s write it together.’ Because I knew how good Terry was, and I knew that I was a baby.” The process, he added, “was like being apprenticed to a master craftsman.” 
 They sold the novel in 1989. Shortly after, Gaiman said, the two began talking about what a next installment to the book might look like. Pratchett died in 2015 and the sequel was never written, but it did, Gaiman said, have a title — “668: The Neighbor of the Beast.” 
 “A lot of the trappings and the idea of what propelled book two into existence wound up integral to what I did in ‘Good Omens’ the TV series,” Gaiman said. In the first book, he added, “We never see hell and we never see heaven. We never actually see the people behind the scenes who are very, very keen on Armageddon.” 
 Those characters are, however, seen in the “Good Omens” miniseries. Michael Sheen and David Tennant play the protagonists, angel Aziraphale and demon Crowley, respectively. Jon Hamm , in his first series work since “Mad Men,” plays Aziraphale’s boss. 
 “I got the lovely, wonderful Jon Hamm to play the angel Gabriel and sell you on the whole thing,” Gaiman said. “I don’t know if it would have been as easy without Jon.” When Gaiman came up with the idea for Gabriel, who is not in the novel, “I just though, ‘Well, he has to be the best looking, best dressed, convinced of his own rightness boss you’ve ever had, and it doesn’t even occur to him in any universe that he could be wrong about anything. And who do I know that could actually play that and pull it off?'” 
 Gaiman wrote to Hamm. 
 “I sent him an email, saying, ‘Dear Jon Hamm, some years ago you told me that ‘Good Omens’ was your favorite book when you were in college and that it was unfilmable, and I have made the mistake of turning it into television, and would you mind playing Gabriel? He isn’t in the book.'” 
 Gaiman received a simple response. The actor wrote back, “Yes,” and signed the email “HAMM” in capital letters — “which is how Jon Hamm signs everything,” Gaiman said.",1

 ST. LOUIS — Riders 13 to 25 years old will again be able to use MetroLink and Metro buses at cut-rate fares under a program that begins again Saturday. 
 The program, which ran last summer on a pilot basis , is aimed at making it easier for young people to get to summer jobs, recreational programs, summer school and other activities. 
 To participate, young riders must get a Gateway Go Card, a special version of Metro's smart card fare payment option, by showing proof of their age. A driver's license, birth certificate, school ID or passport all will be accepted. They then can load half-price tickets or passes onto the card. 
 The card can be obtained at the Metro Store at 801 Pine Street, the Metro Transit Access Center at 317 DeBaliviere Avenue or at a Metro information bus that shows up periodically at neighborhood festivals and other events. 
 The card can be used in St. Louis, St. Louis County and St. Clair County. This year's program ends Aug. 31. 
 The program's renewal was announced Friday at the Clayton Transit Center at an event attended by St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, St. Clair County Board Chairman Mark Kern and Metro officials. 
 Former Olympic athlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee also took part in the announcement. Backers said among the card users would be participants in summer activities at the youth center in East St. Louis operated by Joyner-Kersee's foundation.

51988,"Students at Greene-Hills K-8 School create a special day to honor their late teacher 
 Written by SUSAN CORICA 
 @coricaBP 
 BRISTOL - Elementary students in the gifted program at Greene-Hills K-8 School organized a special day to honor a departed teacher. 
 Stacey Porrini Clingan, who taught first grade at Greene-Hills, died of cancer at age 42 last year. 
 Alan Theriault, gifted program director, said the students were challenged to come up with a project that would solve a school need and leave a legacy behind. 
 They brainstormed ideas and the final decision - made by students Caitlyn Carbone, Lyla Sowder, Lillian VanNostrand, Cody Skypek, Jacson Deveau, and Rocky Bonin - “was to attempt to plan, organize, promote, and schedule a day to honor Stacey Clingan, a beloved teacher at Greene-Hills who passed away in March of 2018,” he said. 
 Fifth-grader Caitlyn, a former student of Clingan, felt there should be a way to honor her teacher through her love of basketball. 
 May 20 was designed “Clingan’s Court” at Greene-Hills, Theriault said. “Leading up to the event, students organized coin drives, created promotional posters, wrote promotional announcements, and scheduled a day of activities.” 
 In addition, students created a master schedule for all classes to have convenient time slots to enjoy a day of basketball-related festivities, he said. “Greene-Hills art teacher Jen Chase also put together an art project allowing students to decorate Relay for Life luminarias.” 
 Students worked the entire day, making and selling popcorn, leading classes through the basketball skills challenges, and overseeing the art project, he said. 
 The culminating activity was a school staff versus middle school basketball game after school, which started with a video montage of “Mrs. Clingan.” 
 “Her husband, Bill, was in attendance and shared some wonderful thoughts with our students,” Theriault said. “After the video, Greene-Hills Principal Scott Gaudet and student Caitlyn Carbone addressed the crowd and the game was on. In a spirited contest, the staff was able to outlast a very resilient student team coached by teacher Stacey Rivoira.” 
 The day raised $600 in total, of which $500 will be earmarked for a scholarship in Clingan’s name, established by her Greene-Hills colleagues. The other $100 will be donated in her memory to the American Cancer Society, Theriault said. 
 “The level of engagement, leadership, and compassion that students exhibited during this process has made me as proud as I have ever been as a teacher,” he said. “If more students follow the lead of Caitlyn, Lyla, Lilly, Cody, Jacson, and Rocky we will all be in good hands.” 
 As Stacey Porrini, Clingan was a member of the Bristol Central Class of 1993, where she competed in swimming, basketball, and track and field, and earned all-conference honors in each sport. 
 She had been battling breast cancer since 2010, but had been teaching as recently as two weeks before her death, Gaudet recalled in 2018. He said he had personally gone to her class to deliver the news to her young students. 
 A few days later the school held a dress down day on March 29, raising $1,000 for the Clingan family, and put luminaria bags out in front of the school. 
 Clingan was inducted into the Bristol Sports Hall of Fame in 2016. She went on to the University of Maine to play basketball. During her tenure the school earned three NCAA berths. She had 1,128 points, 929 rebounds and 220 blocks in her career at Maine. She was named second team All-East Conference her junior year and first team as a senior. 
 Following college, she coached girls youth sports. She was honored by the Bristol Tramps in 2011 for her contributions to Bristol sports. 
 Joanne McCallie was Clingan’s coach at Maine. “She was such a special person. Right away there was a lot of chemistry between her, her family, and our staff, and so we felt very good about her coming to the University of Maine.” 
 “She went through a career where she was a leader and a captain,” said McCallie, who is now head coach of the women’s basketball team at Duke University. “She was our starting center, our leader. We beat Alabama when they were ranked 10th in the nation and undefeated. She made history at Maine and she helped us recruit some of the best players. And she had a lovely personality.” 
 Clingan graduated Maine in 1997 with a degree in elementary education. McCallie said she must have made a great teacher despite being so tall – at six foot four inches - compared to her young students. “I just can imagine how the first graders would look up to her, not just literally but figuratively too.”

 To stroll hand in-hand with one Princess is fortunate enough – to have two on your arm might be considered downright greedy. 
 But those who know him best say Princess Beatrice’s boyfriend, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, has always been a lucky chap. 
 The 35-year-old property developer joined Beatrice, 30, and her younger sister Eugenie on a night out in Notting Hill, West London , on Friday. 
 Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 35, was spotted holding hands with the sisters on a night out in Notting Hill 
 In fact, it was a double date. Eugenie’s husband Jack Brooksbank paced some distance ahead, turning at one stage as if to beseech the others to hurry up. 
 Perhaps given the company, Edoardo might have tried a bit harder with his footwear. He wore scruffy trainers which looked conspicuous even on Portobello Road, home of the world-famous street market.

 It was at the height of Hillary Clinton’s influence as secretary of state under Barack Obama that she was using a private and unsecured email server for national secrets, in violation of practice and precedent, when she was warned not to do that. 
 Twice. 
 The warnings came from Eric Boswell, a former assistant secretary of state for Diplomatic Security. 
 His warnings came to light through a deposition in a lawsuit by Washington watchdog Judicial Watch, which has been given permission by a federal judge to take statements from figures in the Clinton email scandal. 
 In his testimony, Boswell said Clinton was warned twice against using unsecure BlackBerry smartphones and personal emails to transmit classified material. 
 But she did it anyway. 
 “Boswell, who was responsible for securing classified and national security information, stated that Clinton and her staff were ‘wedded to their BlackBerrys,'” Judicial Watch said. “Additionally, he stated that he and other former State Department employees ‘were surprised’ that Clinton used clintonemail.com to conduct official government business.” 
 He said Clinton and others were warned in 2009 that “any unclassified Blackberry is highly vulnerable in any setting to remotely and covertly monitoring conversations, retrieving emails and exploiting calendars.” 
 Clinton was warned again in 2011 when Boswell said, “We also urge Department users to minimize the use of personal web email for business, as some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these actors to automatically forward copies of all composed emails to an undisclosed recipient.” 
 He testified Clinton assured him that she “gets it.” 
 But he stated that Clinton and staff members were “wedded to their BlackBerries” and wanted to continue using them in secure areas because it was convenient. 
 Boswell was deposed as part of the discovery granted to Judicial Watch by U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth in response to its Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. 
 Others on the list for questioning include Justin Cooper, a former aide to Bill Clinton who reportedly had no security clearance and is believed to have played a key role in setting up Hillary Clinton’s non-government email system; John Hackett, a State Department records official; and Jacob Sullivan, Hillary Clinton’s former senior adviser. 
 Another is Susan Rice, Obama’s former U.N. ambassador, who appeared on Sunday television news shows following the Benghazi attacks blaming a “hateful video.” She also was involved in unmasking the names of senior Trump officials who were spied on by the Obama administration. 
 “Thanks to our court-ordered discovery, we now have confirmation that Hillary Clinton was warned by the top security official in the State Department that unsecure Blackberry and email use was a security risk, yet Hillary Clinton ignored these warnings,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. 
 Judicial Watch has launched multiple lawsuits to obtain information about Hillary Clinton’s email scandal, and said earlier this month that the Obama White House knew about the scandal earlier than previously admitted and tried to cover it up. 
 The documents, obtained from the State Department through court-ordered discovery , “suggest the Obama White House knew about the Clinton email lies being told to the public at least as early as December 2012,” the watchdog group said. 
 WND reported in April a senior FBI official, E.W. Priestap, admitted under oath the bureau found emails sent from Clinton’s unsecured server in President Obama’s executive office in the White House. 
 Fitton said at the time that the confirmation made under oath showed that the Obama FBI had to go to President Obama’s White House office “to find emails that Hillary Clinton tried to destroy or hide from the American people.” 
 Fitton was referring to the more than 30,000 emails under subpoena that were thoroughly deleted through an application called BleachBit by order of Clinton’s State Department team. 
 When then FBI Director James Comey announced in July 2016 that the FBI had decided not to refer criminal charges in the case, he nevertheless said Clinton had been “extremely careless” in her handling of classified information. 
 More than 100 emails on her server contained classified information, including 65 emails deemed “Secret” and 22 “Top Secret.” Another 2,093 emails were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. 
 Lamberth has described the Clinton email system as “one of the gravest modern offenses to government transparency.”",1

 It will be women who save America from President Donald Trump’s corrupt administration. Their Washington demonstration, larger than Trump’s inaugural crowd the day before, lit the fuse. The midterm elections produced motivated, capable female candidates, and women voters turned out to elect them. 
 Women don’t like Trump’s “grab ’em” attitude, adulteries, lies and coverups. They won’t abide Republican efforts to control women’s lives and bodies. Mothers are horrified that children are torn from their families at the Mexican border, some separated forever. Wives, single women and mothers are scared that Trump and the Republicans will eliminate their or their families’ healthcare, continue to do nothing about gun violence, and ignore climate change that threatens their families and future generations. 
 Women question why equal pay is still an issue and know that Trump’s tax cut didn't make a big difference in finances, while costs are rising, family savings are minimal, and the middle class is disappearing. Black women remember Trump's comments about “low I.Q. person,” “fine people on both sides,” and the NFL/NBA players' protests. 
 Women might take exception to Trump’s bullying and juvenile name-calling. Underprivileged women may expect the Republican blowup of the deficit/debt will lead to Republican calls to cut social programs like Medicaid, food stamps, school lunch programs, student loans, etc. (A Trump second term equals Social Security and Medicare cuts!) 
 Women know guilty people cover up, and innocent people don’t hide information and obstruct. I hope women realize that Republican politicians who fear Trump’s power to threaten their jobs, support his corrupt administration, and shield him from investigations, need to be removed, or everything Trump has broken or soiled will not get fixed. Women may teach Trump he cannot get away with shooting someone on Fifth Avenue. And men can help, too!

36473,"NBA Finals: Warriors rule Durant out for Game 2; Iguodala has MRI 
  
 By Tim ReynoldsThe Associated Press 
 Saturday 
 Jun 1, 2019 at 4:10 PM Jun 1, 2019 at 4:10 PM 
 TORONTO — Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant is going to miss Game 2 of the NBA Finals, and Andre Iguodala's health is of at least mild concern to the two-time defending champion Warriors as well. 
 Iguodala, the 2015 NBA Finals Most Valuable Player, had an MRI on Friday on his left leg after he was hurt late in Game 1 of the title-series opener against the Toronto Raptors. Durant, the finals MVP in 2017 and 2018 who has been dealing with a strained calf, was ruled out by Warriors coach Steve Kerr in an expected move. 
 ""Kevin's not going to play Sunday,"" Kerr said. ""I guess we've been holding out hope, but might as well say it now. ... It's near-impossible for him to play on Sunday."" 
 The Raptors took Game 1 and will host Game 2 on Sunday night. Iguodala expects to play, and the Warriors said his MRI came back clean. 
 ""He seems to be doing well. ... I talked to him and he said he felt pretty good,"" Kerr said. 
 Iguodala scored with just under two minutes left in Game 1, his left leg flaring out a bit as he leaped to take that shot from the middle of the lane. He immediately grabbed the back of the leg in the hamstring area after landing, clapped his hands while grimacing and hobbled down to the other end. 
 The Warriors subbed him out not long afterward, and he didn't return. 
 Iguodala started and played 29 minutes in Game 1, finishing with six points, six rebounds and seven assists. He was slowed in the Western Conference finals by a problem with his left calf, and he missed the clinching Game 4 of that series. 
 Kerr said the team isn't going to rush Durant's return. The fear is that if he comes back before the calf is sound even the slightest tweak would mean his season is over. 
 Durant hasn't played since he was hurt in Game 5 of the West semifinals against the Houston Rockets. 
 ""The thinking is when he's ready to play, he'll play,"" Kerr said. 
 Durant traveled with the team to Toronto, wanting to be with his teammates for the start of the Finals and needing to work with the Warriors' medical staff. 
 ""He's still progressing,"" Kerr said.

 The people of northeast England learned this week that they’re now represented in the European Parliament by a man named Brian Monteith. A member of the Brexit Party and a well-off businessman with a private-school education, Mr. Monteith joins a caucus of members of European Parliament who believe Britain should not be represented in that legislature and should cut its formal ties with the continent. 
 Mr. Monteith was not exactly a familiar face to them. That’s because he lives in the village of Trévien, in the Midi-Pyrénées region of southern France. He campaigned in England, on his anti-Europe platform, by flying back and forth from his French village, where he’s able to avail himself of France’s excellent healthcare and public services thanks to his European citizenship. 
 You might regard Mr. Monteith’s jolly hypocrisy as an irony-laced anomaly – a man whose life seemed comically out of step with his political faction. 
 Story continues below advertisement 
 In fact, his rootlessness and privilege are the quintessence of the Brexit movement. Like other nationalist factions around the world, it is predominantly an elite movement, one whose leaders, founders, organizers and key supporters are well-off figures who could be described as “anywheres” – individuals who can already afford to live in any country they choose, and shift their assets into whatever banking and taxation system suits them best, and who thus have little use for awkward international bodies.

 Unlike most working Britons, the Brexiteers’ livelihoods do not depend on the trade and jobs and services that flow from European unification and robust public institutions (almost all of the Brexiteers have private educations and pay for private medicine). So, they view those ties and institutions as an annoying hindrance to their freedom, a source of taxes and pesky regulations that hamper their already-international lives. 
 Britain’s current political crisis is thus a direct consequence of its class system – but it’s not the class division you think it is. The great legerdemain of nationalist movements, in Britain and elsewhere, has been in creating the illusion of being a voice of the “have-nots” – in good part because they persuaded a wide range of people to vote in a 2016 referendum on an issue that had never been of great public interest. The majority (59 per cent) of people who voted “Leave” were middle class or better, but it’s true that most lower-income districts did vote to leave, continuing a long British history of the workers unwittingly doing the bidding of the landed classes. 
 The plutocratic nature of the Brexit scheme is no longer very well hidden, in the wake of the resignation announcement last week by Prime Minister Theresa May, who, as a vicar’s daughter of ordinary means, had temporarily given the movement a more humble face. 
 That power vacuum is now being filled by the original Brexit authors. The favoured challenger to replace Ms. May is Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and newspaper columnist. Educated at Eton and at a private school in Brussels, Mr. Johnson spent much of the last three decades living on the continent and currently spends part of the year at his father’s villa in Greece.

 Nigel Farage, whose career was revived when his Brexit Party did well in the European elections, is the private-school-educated father of two German children, and is likely eligible for German citizenship himself. He spends his spare time shark fishing in Kenya and other sunny former imperial outposts, and has his considerable private earnings paid into an offshore bank account. 
 The posh cosmopolitanism of Brexit has always been its defining feature – a fact I recognize from my own family history. There is a British branch of my father’s French Huguenot family (sadly not the branch we’re part of) that has long been wealthy and well-connected, and played a key role in promoting the idea of a rerun for the British EU referendum (the original one, in 1975, produced a strong Remain result). 
 Story continues below advertisement 
 Story continues below advertisement 
 Nicholas Luard, a great uncle a couple times removed (but close enough that Luard is one of the given names of both my father and my son), was an international adventurer who lived a coddled life. After completing his boarding-school education, he inherited a pot of money which he used to purchase the upstart magazine Private Eye and a Soho nightclub, before launching a career writing thick novels set in interesting countries in which he’d resided. 
 He broke into politics in the 1990s as a co-founder of the Referendum Party, launched with another wealthy offshore businessman which later melded into Mr. Farage’s movement. He ran in the 1997 election and lost, all while living the easy and low-tax life he’d enjoyed for decades in Andalusia, Spain. 
 So, Brian Monteith is far from the first or the only Brexiteer to live a life of adventure on the continent while campaigning against continental adventures. That simultaneous having and eating of cake has long been an amusing folly of the fortunate few – one that has now tossed their rarely visited country into a decade of chaos.

 Comment: Pakistan’s unreadiness for World Cup exposed by WI 
 9 
 The West Indies did not require anything sensational to persuade Pakistan’s batsmen to play rash strokes. — File photo courtesy of PCB 
 PAKISTAN’S unreadiness for the challenge is a missed opportunity since this is one of the most open World Cups in history. England are deserved favourites based on form and home advantage. India, with Virat Kohli, look a force to be reckoned with. Beyond that it is anybody’s World Cup. 
 In recent years, Trent Bridge has produced some of the highest scores in one-day cricket, but Pakistan failed to post a total worthy of an international team. Despite overcast conditions, Pakistan were not outdone by swing or seam. They fell to poor shot selection and shot execution, especially when West Indies decided to test them with short pitched pace bowling . 
 The West Indies fast bowlers were good but did not require anything sensational to persuade Pakistan’s batsmen to play rash strokes. Some dismissals were unfortunate. Imam-ul Haq and Sarfraz Ahmed both nicked leg side deliveries, and Fakhar Zaman played on to his stumps via an unlucky bounce of his helmet. The rest were in too much of a rush when the situation required some circumspection. 
 Pakistan, backed by wonderful support from British Pakistanis, collapsed from 35 for 1 to 105 all out in a performance short of application and skill. The bowlers were then unable to exert any pressure on the West Indies as they quickly achieved their target with the help of a stand-and deliver fifty from Chris Gayle. 
 The one bright note for Pakistan was an impressive spell of three wickets by Mohammad Amir. That would usually bode well for Pakistan except his fellow pacemen were unable to follow his lead. Wahab Riaz was his usual mixture of good and bad. Hassan Ali continues his struggle to be as effective as he was when he first joined the international team. 
 Most worryingly, Sarfraz Ahmed is a captain unable to galvanise his men. If captains are unable to inspire their team by their oratory or tactics, they must do it by the strength of their performances. Sarfraz is filling a top order batting slot, and when the going gets tough he needs to get going. 
 Pakistan last played a 50-over World Cup match in England in 1999. Wasim Akram’s team was probably the finest one-day team that Pakistan has ever produced. They shone in the tournament but collapsed horribly in the final. When we left Lord’s in 1999, we could not have imagined that Pakistan would fail to mount another serious challenge for the World Cup. 
 You sense that there is something in this Pakistan bowling attack to encourage hope but scores of under 250 are no longer defendable in one-day cricket - and Pakistan were some way off that at Trent Bridge. There is time enough for Pakistan to transform their fortunes but Sarfraz Ahmed’s team doesn’t seem ready for success in this year’s World Cup. 
 The early stages of an international tournament are deceptive but there was a ring of truth about Pakistan’s collapse to West Indies at Trent Bridge. There is potential for the future in this team, but the World Cup is now. Pakistan are packed with inexperience and short of confidence, which is a worrying combination for the world’s premier international 50-over tournament.

 Medicaid coverage, especially for minority and low-income women, plays a key role in improving the health of moms and babies, according to a new report. 
 By looking at the difference between women’s insurance coverage and the health outcomes of moms and babies, researchers at Georgetown University Center for Children and Families show that states that have not expanded Medicaid have worse maternal and infant health outcomes compared with the states that have expanded Medicaid. 
 “The message of the study is clear. Medicaid expansion can protect the lives and help women and their babies, especially for women of color,” said Dr. Rahul Gupta, chief medical officer of March of Dimes, which contributed to the report. “We have a policy option at our fingertips that can reduce health disparities and save lives.” 
 The report shows that states that have expanded Medicaid, infant mortality rates have declined 50% more than non-expansion states. Also, in those states, the maternal mortality rates have dropped by 1.6 per 100,000 women and helped reduce racial disparities that are pervasive across the nation. 
 Black moms and babies are two to three times more likely to die within the first year after delivery compared with white moms. In states that have expanded Medicaid, that divide is narrowing. 
 “Medicaid expansion is providing one of the few examples of an intervention proven to address these disparities,” said Gupta. “Infant mortality has declined much more dramatically in states that expanded Medicaid and those declines were actually greater among African American infants, something we haven’t seen with any other kind of an intervention.” 
 The report’s findings are not good news for Florida, one of 14 states that have resisted Medicaid expansion. 
 In a nationwide comparison, Florida ranked in the bottom quarter in maternal and infant mortality rates in 2018, according to America’s Health Rankings. Black moms and babies in Florida continue to be more than twice as likely to die in the first year after delivery, compared with white moms. 
 “It seems like Florida’s women and children are our real victims,” said Anne Swerlick, senior health policy analyst at the Florida Policy Institute, hoping that the report can serve as an impetus for policymakers to consider expanding Medicaid. “If we’re going to be a family-friendly state, one of the key things we need to do is to support families.” 
 Rep. Nick Duran, D-Miami, said for a state that prides itself in being pro-life, “we aren’t positioning ourselves to ensure that women are healthiest they can be when they’re young, all the way through.” 
 The Affordable Care Act made it optional for states to expand Medicaid. By expanding Medicaid, states cover adults who earn as much as 138% of federal poverty level, or about $29,000 for a family of three. 
 But in states like Florida, those limits are set much lower. 
 Medicaid, a public health insurance for low-income people jointly funded by federal and state dollars, covers children, pregnant women, parents, seniors and people with disabilities. About 4 million people in Florida have Medicaid. The majority are children. Adults with no children, including women of childbearing age, no matter how low their income, are not eligible for Florida Medicaid.

 Lawmakers in Florida have opposed Medicaid expansion for several reasons. Some have a strong political opposition to the Affordable Care Act, while others worry that the federal government could pull back from paying for most of the cost of the Medicaid expansion, leaving the states to figure out how to pay for it. 
 In Florida, once women become pregnant, they can qualify for Medicaid as long as their income is at or below 196% of the federal poverty level. That’s about a $42,000 annual income. That coverage expires at the end of the second month after the baby is delivered. 
 But studies have shown that health and mental care for moms should continue far beyond the early days after delivery, when complications such as high blood pressure or depression can affect moms and as a result, the babies’ care.

 “It’s becoming increasingly clear that we can’t just cover women while they’re pregnant,” said Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. “Expanding Medicaid is not enough to address the many challenges our country faces with respect to the health of mothers and babies. But without it, and without the continuous affordable comprehensive coverage for women of childbearing age it provides, it will be near impossible to see sharp improvements.” 
 Florida’s uninsured rate has dropped by 10% since the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2014, from 29% in to 19%. But according to the study, there are twice as many uninsured women in Florida between ages 18 and 44 compared with states that have expanded Medicaid. The rate of uninsured Florida women in that age range is 19%, compared to the average of 9% in states that have expanded Medicaid. 
 The state’s rate of maternal deaths has fluctuated over the years without a drastic change, from 17.8 deaths per 100,000 births in 1999 to 16.5 deaths in 2017, according to the state health department data. That’s 35 deaths in 1999 compared to 37 deaths in 2017. Black women in Florida are more than twice as likely to die within the first year of giving birth than white women. 
 In California, which has the nation’s lowest maternal mortality rate, about 5 in 100,000 women die during the first year after delivery. 
 Infant mortality rates in Florida have seen a somewhat of steady but small decline during the past two decades, dropping from 8.2% in 1999, or 1,443 deaths, to 7.8% in 2017, or 1,355 deaths, according to the Florida Department of Health. Again, black babies are more than twice as likely to die within the first year of birth than white babies. 
 Massachusetts has the nation’s lowest infant mortality rate at 3.7 in 100,000 babies. 
 Discussions about Medicaid expansion didn’t go far in the most recent legislative session. Instead, the Florida House passed a bill for Medicaid work requirement, which could have led about to 100,000 low-income parents to lose their health insurance, Alker said. The bill did not get much traction in the Senate. 
 Duran, who introduced a bill during the most recent legislative session to expand Medicaid for certain individuals, said “the report is just a great indicator of how easy the decision should be about us moving forward with Medicaid expansion.” 
 “I’m an eternal optimist,” said Duran. “And I will always look at the next session as the opportunity to expand the conversation on Medicaid program.”

 Trump Declares War On Silicon Valley: DoJ Launches Google Anti-Monopoly Probe 
 by  Tyler Durden 
 . 
 Once shielded by the logic of Silicon Valley’s relentless churn of innovation – which dictated that no reigning tech empire could rule for long before going the way of Yahoo and AOL – tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google have been subjected to intensifying anti-trust pressure – Elizabeth Warren’s “Break up Big Tech”s billboard is only the latest example. Indeed, big tech trust-busting has become one of the few issues in contemporary Washington that garners genuine bipartisan support. 
 Since the Trump administration swept into power two years ago in spite of thinly veiled opposition from Silicon Valley – as it was later revealed, big tech effectively conspired with the Clinton campaign to hurt Trump’s chances – the drumbeat of unprecedented anti-trust scrutiny has grown steadily louder, facilitated by the president’s own publicly-voiced suspicions. 
 And on Friday, the levee finally broke. 
 Just before midnight on Friday, at the close of what was a hectic month for markets,  WSJ  dropped a bombshell of a story: The paper reported that the DoJ has opened an anti-trust investigation of Alphabet Inc., which could “present a major new layer of regulatory scrutiny for the search giant, according to people familiar with the matter.” The report was sourced to “people familiar with the matter,” but was swiftly corroborated by the New York Times, Bloomberg and others. 
 For months now, the FTC has appeared to be gearing up for a showdown with big tech. The agency – which shares anti-trust authority with the DoJ –  has created a new commission  that could help undo big-tech tie-ups like Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram, and hired lawyers who have advanced  new anti-monopoly theories  that would help justify the breakup of companies like Amazon. 
 But as it turns out, the Trump administration’s first salvo against big tech didn’t come from the FTC; instead, this responsibility has been delegated to the DoJ, which has reportedly been tasked with supervising the investigation into Google. 
 That’s not super surprising, since the FTC already had its chance to nail Google with an anti-monopoly probe back in 2013. But the agency came up short. From what we can tell, it appears the administration will divvy up responsibility for any future anti-trust investigations between the two agencies, which means the FTC – which is already reportedly preparing to levy a massive fine against Facebook – could end up taking the lead in those cases. 
 Though WSJ didn’t specify which aspects of Google’s business might come under the microscope, a string of multi-billion-euro fines recently levied by the EU might offer some guidance. The bloc’s anti-trust authority, which has been far more eager to take on American tech giants than its American counterpart (for reasons that should be obvious to all), has fined Google over its practice of bundling software with its standard Android license, the way its search engine rankings favor its own product listings, and ways it has harmed competition in the digital advertising market. 
 During the height of the controversy over big tech’s abuses of sensitive user data last year, the Verge published a story speculating about how the monopolistic tendencies of each of the dominant Silicon Valley tech giants could be remedied. For Google,  the Verge  argued, the best remedy would be a ban on acquisitions – a strategy that has been bandied about in Congress. 
 Our best model for tech antitrust is the Department of Justice’s anti-bundling case against Microsoft in the ’90s, which argued that Microsoft was using its control over the PC market to force out competing operating systems and browsers. If you’re looking for a contemporary equivalent, Google is probably the closest fit. On a good day, Google (or Alphabet, if you prefer) is the most valuable company in the world by market cap, with dozens of different products supported by an all-encompassing ad network. Google also has clear and committed enemies, with Microsoft, Oracle, Yelp, and even the Motion Picture Association of America calling for restrictions on the company’s power. 
 But according to Open Markets’ Matthew Stoller, the best long-term remedy for Google’s dominance has more to do with Google’s acquisitions. “If you’re looking for a silver bullet, probably the best thing to do would be to block Google from being able to buy any companies,” says Stoller. “Suddenly, you have to compete with Google, you can’t just be bought out by Google.” 
 That might sound tame compared to Europe’s billion-dollar fines, but it cuts to the core of how Google is organized. The company has acquired more than 200 startups since it was founded, including central products like YouTube, Android, and DoubleClick. The company’s modular structure is arguably a direct result of that buying spree, and it’s hard to imagine what Google would look like without it. More recent buys like Nest have fallen under the broader Alphabet umbrella, but the core strategy hasn’t changed. Would Google still be an AI giant if it hadn’t bought DeepMind? Probably, but everyone involved would have had to work a lot harder. 
 Even better, anti-monopoly activists would have a bunch of different ways to block those acquisitions. The Department of Justice’s antitrust division hasn’t contested Google’s acquisitions so far, but it could always change its approach.The strongest fix would come from Congress, where Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) has introduced a bill that would place an outright ban on acquisitions by any company with a market cap higher than $100 billion. (As of press time, Google is worth roughly $840 billion.) 
 We feel it’s no exaggeration to say that this is only the beginning of what could become an epoch-defining story arch. And like every good story, this one will have main characters and bit players. As far as we can tell, one of the leading roles will likely be played by Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, a previously obscure Trump Administration official who is now in charge of one of the most consequential investigations in recent memory. 
 Setting aside what it might mean for Silicon Valley, the investigation will also have major ramifications for markets, since shares of the big tech companies have been at the vanguard of the torrid post-crisis bull market. Though the influence of FANG stocks on overall market performance has waned this year, they remain hugely influential. 
 Tech giants are far and away the biggest contributors to SPX sales growth…

31323,"Sarri requests Chelsea exit as agreement reached with Juventus 
 Lacazette is a proven performer in that position and would be a useful alternative, or successor to Uruguayan frontman Suarez in Catalunya. 
 He has just been named Arsenal’s Player of the Season for 2018-19, recording 19 goals and 13 assists , while previously being a prolific presence in his homeland at Lyon. 
 Puel was the man to give him his senior bow and has told El Pais of a top talent: “Lacazette can be a player like Luis Suarez. 
 “He can go into the midfield a little and ask to get the ball in space. For me, he could do very, very well in Barcelona. 
 “Suarez's problem is that he has lost some physical condition. He was more powerful and started more. Not now. 
 “He knows how to get away, go deep and ask for the ball, because he is a scorer. But you need something more. 
 “With Guardiola, Barca played 80 per cent of the game in the opposition half of the field. Now they accept playing a low block. When you are so deep, you need a striker to hold the ball when you get it to allow the team to advance. Suarez loses the ball continuously.” 
 While suggesting that Lacazette could be the man to improve Barcelona’s forward line, Puel admits that he did not always see him as a team player. 
 He added on his first experiences of a Lyon native: “I went to see him play with the Lyon reserve team. He never ran, he never asked for the ball, he did not move into space, he did not defend. Nothing, nothing, nothing. 
 “He did nothing in 90 minutes. But he scored a goal and he was happy. For him, that amounted to a good game. 
 Article continues below 
 “He had a great character. It was difficult to make him understand that he needed to work, run, ask for the ball in space. 
 “First, I made him play as a forward because we had many strikers. Then I put him up top so that when he won the ball, he needed time holding it until the others arrived. 
 “He has everything that a scorer needs. He is small, but that is not a problem for him. He has progressed a lot without the ball. Run, work for the team. He has become a complete player.”",1

 Amazing Love, Amazing Grace: Reflective Thoughts from My GCN Experience January 16, 2016 Amber Cantorna 
 Patheos Explore the world's faith through different perspectives on religion and spirituality! Patheos has the views of the prevalent religions and spiritualities of the world. 
 This past weekend, I attended the Gay Christian Network Conference for the second time, this year hosted in Houston, Texas. As my wife as I flew from Denver to Houston last Thursday, I reflected on the first time that I went to the conference 3 years ago and all that has happened in my life since then. I was in a very different place then, I had just come out and 2012 was the most turbulent year my life had seen yet. Having just looked death in the face (in more ways than one), I was turning a corner but not yet out of the woods. I came to Phoenix with a heavy heart searching for some hope that my life would get better. Thankfully, I found it. In a workshop I attended, a comment I made apparently perked some ears as I was later approached by a man and his wife who simply said, “Hi, my wife and I wondered if we could take you to dinner.” To which I was a little dumbfounded but replied, “…Ok!” 
 That was the beginning of a turning of tides for me, and 2 years later because of the bond that was formed with them at GCN that weekend, they ended up being the ones who stood in my parent’s place at my wedding in June 2014. They helped me get ready and they walked me down the aisle to give me away. Though I didn’t know it when I met them, it turned out to be a divine connection. 
 Now attending the conference this past weekend for the first time with my wife, my life is in a completely different place. Not only have I fallen in love, gotten married and purchased our first home together, but my life is finally positioned where I feel like I can do what God is calling me to do, and that is to be a voice. 
 One of the biggest take-aways I had from this past weekend is that, as the daughter of a executive employee at Focus on the Family who has lost everything since coming out, embedded in my identity is a responsibility to be a voice for those who can not yet speak. God is now using my story to catapult me into ministry and what an incredible ride it is turning out to be! 
 This past weekend, I was privileged to have meetings with a myriad of amazing people who are already doing incredible work on the front lines of changing our culture when it comes to these issues of faith and sexuality. There were so many people in attendance at the conference who were living proof of the capability for intersectionality on these issues. That was so needed because there were an equal number of people in attendance who were looking for that proof. 
 As we listened to Justin Lee’s keynote on Sunday morning where he talked about privilege and our need to be empathetic rather than sympathetic, I was reminded once again how much the way we interact with one another matters. How much respect matters. How much dignity matters. And how incredibly vital spaces like GCN are, not only for LGBT people, but for parents of LGBT kids and our straight allies as well. GCN is one of the only spaces I know of where people can come from all over the world, from every denominational background imaginable and from differing views and beliefs when it comes to Side A/Side B theology and agree to disagree in a safe space where we can love one another well. That my friends, is true love; unconditional love; amazing love. 
 At the end of Mary Lambert’s concert Friday night, she performed her Grammy-nominated song “Same Love” inviting all who wanted, to join her in dancing together in the empty space below the stage. As I slow danced with my wife, tears streamed down my face in a place where our love for one another was validated and we were safe to be our real selves among 1,450 likeminded people. It was one of my favorite moments of the weekend. 
 Similarly in the worship sessions led before each keynote speech, I stood there and cried as well because for the first time in 8 years, I was able to stand before God with my worshipper’s heart freely before Him without feeling the stare of disapproving eyes around me or the lurking feeling in my heart of, “If they only knew…” as if being gay somehow disqualified me from standing in church. But here, I was able to unashamedly with a room full of other LGBT believers, parents and allies sing:

 Alexander Wang heads to Rockefeller Plaza for al fresco show

 Back to Gallery 
 NEW YORK (AP) — Embracing Manhattan's iconic Rockefeller Center as his venue, Alexander Wang offered a huge hug to his city and American fashion as he showed his latest collection al fresco Friday night — complete with street food and a public crowd joining the usual insiders. 
 This ready-to-wear Collection 1 is the start of his second year off the traditional fashion week calendar, choosing June and December over February and September in a plan to offer more options to consumers throughout each year. 
 There seemed to be something freeing about that for the designer, who joyously waved to the crowd at the close of his show in pink print cutoffs and a white sweatshirt, bringing family up on his ever-changing lit stage as the sun went down. 
 Coming just a few days after Memorial Day, Wang was in an all-American red, white and blue mood, flashing a U.S. flag branded with an ""a'' for, yes, Alexander, as the real thing lined the center's lower plaza on poles. It's where Rockefeller Center's popular skating rink draws masses of tourists. 
 Above, Wang branded his food-cart hot dogs, slushies and pretzels for his guests with the same ""a."" His flag made it onto some sweaters and wide elastic undershort waistbands as well. 
 ""We're so honored to be here at Rockefeller Center,"" Wang said live on Instagram, YouTube and his website during a pre-show hosted by the young, goofy YouTuber Jay Versace, a fashion show newbie. ""I love New York. It is my home. I feel so proud to be based here. It's such an incredible city."" 
 A magnet for supermodels on his runways and celebrity followers, Wang didn't disappoint. Diplo was front row and Kaia Gerber and Kendall Jenner were among his walkers. Versace strolled backstage, chatting up Gerber as he watched the models getting their hair and makeup done. 
 Restricting the public to a street-level view of the show, looking down, Wang set up his benches for insiders around the golden masterwork Prometheus, a statue in a fountain done by Paul Manship in 1933. The evening's weather was perfect, closing the city's first sunny, mild day after days of rain. There were smiles all around in the crowd as they were treated to the fresh air. 
 On the runway, Wang paid homage to American fashion and some of its greats — Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein among them — as Anna Wintour explained to Versace. She, too, was pleased the city's torrential rains had stopped and not spoiled the experience. 
 Wang opened the mixed-gender show with a series of button-down coats and jackets for fall. All had one lapel emblazoned with his name. One model walked in a Statue of Liberty crown and others in tiny black silver studded skirts. Wang topped some heads with billed caps that had head wraps on the outside. 
 Denim jackets were paired with asymmetrical skirts, open to the hip on one side and hanging just above the angle on the other. Pete Davison of ""Saturday Night Live"" modeled pants with half black, half white legs, paired with a sleeveless T-shirt on top (showing off his tattoos) and a cap with the bill turned backward. His model strut needs work. 
 Fur trimmed a light blue striped shirt-cuffed coat, while chunky soled sneakers were mixed with stilettoes on the feet of his walkers. Fringy western looks came in black with multiple braided belts. There were bright whites in relaxed trousers and jackets, shorts and culottes, some fit for evening versus day streetwear. 
 Wispy slip dresses were worn over white T-shirts and loose burnished corduroy pants were cinched at the ankle with elastic. An identical pair of the trousers was done in eggplant purple. 
 To close, models stood still in rows, giving the crowd one last long look on Wang's special night.",1

 VIRGINIA BEACH, VA — Twelve people were killed and at least 10 injured in a shooting at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center Friday, May 31, according to Virginia Beach Police. Also dead is the gunman, who was shot and killed by law enforcement. He has been described as a disgruntled employee of the Public Utilities Department. 
 The mass shooting is believed to be the worst in the United States so far this year and the worst in Virginia Beach history. Before, Virginia Beach's worst mass shooting happened in 1994, when four people were shot and killed at the Witchduck Inn, according to The Virginian-Pilot . 
 Police Chief Jim Cervera said the shooter opened fire on workers shortly after 4 p.m. in Building 2, which is next to City Hall and houses the city's public works, planning, public utilities and other departments on 2425 Nimmo Parkway. Officers entered and returned fire, killing the suspect. Cervera said a police officer was among those shot, but was saved by his bulletproof vest, he said. 
 The gunman, who has not been identified by authorities, has been named by CNN, the Wall Street Journal and other media outlets as DeWayne Craddock. He reportedly worked for the city's public works department, had access to the building and came in Friday with a weapon, according to Cervera. This weapon was a 0.45 caliber handgun with suppressor on it, and it had an extended magazine. 
 Police said they will not release the shooter's name until his family is notified. Cervera said when the name is released, that's the only time the gunman will be mentioned by name. Afterward, ""he will be forever referred to as the suspect because our focus now is the dignity and respect to the victims in this case and to their families."" 
 The injured went to area hospitals, and the extent of their injuries was not immediately known. At least five were taken to Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital. One went to Sentara Princess Anne Hospital and was airlifted to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, which is among five hospitals in Virginia that offer the highest level of trauma care, according to Sentara Healthcare. 
 ""This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,"" said Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer at a press conference. 
 A reunification center for survivors and their families has been set up at Princess Anne Middle School at 2323 Holland Road, Virginia Beach, news channel WAVY reported. 
 Cervera did not comment on whether the victims were targeted, citing the ongoing investigation. He said authorities continue the process of identifying the deceased victims. 
 The chief said that his officers were processing at the moment ""what best could be described as a war zone."" He asked the public to keep the families of the victims at the forefront, stating: ""Their lives are changed forever."" 
 Videos posted by WAVY showed multiple police units, including K9s, responding to the scene as people left the building where the shooting took place.

 After hearing what sounded like a gunshot, one man who spoke to the news channel said he found a woman in the stairwell with blood on her face. The man said they were told to leave the building because of a shooter inside. 
 Another person, Megan Banton, told The Virginian-Pilot the shooter opened fire when she was inside. She says a supervisor took her and other workers into an office, blocking the door with a desk. 
 ""This is a horrific day for the Commonwealth of Virginia,"" Gov. Ralph Northam said in a statement. ""My deepest condolences and prayers go to the families of those who left home this morning, and will not return tonight, as well as those who have been injured in this tragedy. This is unspeakable, senseless violence. I commend local and state law enforcement, first responders, medical teams, and all others who acted swiftly to respond to this situation. My thoughts continue to be with the victims and their families."" 
 Northam said he was in Virginia Beach with law enforcement authorities and Mayor Dyer, ""where I am monitoring the situation and offer the state's full support."" 
 Two former Virginia governors-turned U.S. Senators also responded to the killings: 
 From Mark Warner: ""I am horrified by what has happened today in Virginia Beach. I am thankful to law enforcement for their swift and courageous response. My heart goes out to all the victims of today's senseless violence, their families, and the entire community that has been affected by these awful events. I will be praying for the swift recovery of those injured."" 
 And from Tim Kaine: ""I am heartbroken by the horrific shooting today in Virginia Beach. My prayers are with all who have been affected, and I want Virginians to know I will keep pushing for Congress to take action to prevent the daily scourge of gun violence in America. I was just in Virginia Beach this morning. It's such a strong and beautiful community, and the bravery of the first responders today is a testament to that. My heart aches to see it devastated by yet another gun violence tragedy."" 
 Elaine Luria, a Virginia Democrat who represents the state's second congressional district, said in a statement: ""My heart is with all those injured and affected by today's shooting at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center. I'm so thankful for first responders and law enforcement for risking their lives to bring a suspect into custody. This is more proof Congress must act to prevent gun violence."" 
 Performer Pharrell Williams, who is from Virginia Beach and produced an oceanfront concert festival there several weeks ago, said on Twitter: ""We are praying for our city, the lives that were lost, their families and everyone affected. We are resilient. We will not only get through this, but we'll come out of this stronger than before we always do."" 
 A spokeswoman for the FBI in Norfolk said the bureau was responding to assist Virginia Beach Police. 
 The worst case of mass violence in 2019 before was a Feb. 15 workplace shooting at the Henry Pratt Company's manufacturing and warehouse building in Aurora, Illinois.

 North Korea 'executed' officials after failed Donald Trump summit, says report 
 Updated: Jun 01, 2019, 17:37 IST | Agencies 
 ""I don't have anything else to add to that today."" Kim Hyok Chol was the North's counterpart of US special representative Stephen Biegun in the run-up to the Hanoi summit in February

 Seoul: North Korea executed its special envoy to the United States following the collapse of the second summit between leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump, a South Korean newspaper reported on Friday. 
 The Chosun Ilbo said Kim Hyok Chol, who laid the groundwork for the Hanoi meeting and accompanied Kim on his private train, was executed by firing squad for ""betraying the supreme leader"" after he was ""won over to the US"" during pre-summit negotiations. ""Kim Hyok Chol was executed in March at Mirim Airport along with four senior foreign ministry officials following an investigation,"" the newspaper quoted a source as saying. 
 Asked about the account, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was trying to verify it. ""We've seen the reporting to which you're referring. We're doing our best to check it out,"" he told reporters on a visit to Berlin. ""I don't have anything else to add to that today."" Kim Hyok Chol was the North's counterpart of US special representative Stephen Biegun in the run-up to the Hanoi summit in February. 
 Riyadh rallies allies against Tehran 
 Gulf and Arab allies rallied around Saudi Arabia on Friday as it ratcheted up tensions with regional rival Iran after a series of attacks, drawing accusations from Tehran of ""sowing division"". Tehran, which has strongly denied involvement in any of the attacks, expressed disappointment that Riyadh plans to level the same ""baseless accusations"" at a summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) early on Saturday. 
 Iran rejects US Mideast peace plan 
 Thousands of Iranians joined annual rallies in support of the Palestinian cause on Friday, rejecting a US peace plan Donald Trump has dubbed the ""deal of the century"". The Quds (Jerusalem) Day commemorations were launched by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

28805,"Woman Miraculously Comes Back To Life After Dying During Childbirth

 Anna Harnes 
 Many people talk about the miracle of childbirth, but few have endured a literal miracle during their labor. However, that’s exactly what 29-year-old Nicole Hall experienced. She died while giving birth to her third child, but was miraculously revived following the delivery, per The Sun . 
 During delivery, Nicole flatlined — and doctors were forced to perform a c-section to try to save the baby, after feeling it kick. However, doctors were stunned to see that Nicole’s pulse returned after the baby was delivered. 
 Nicole was induced at Colorado’s UCH Memorial North Hospital, and had reached seven centimeters in dilation when an incident of amniotic fluid embolism struck the mom-to-be. 
 Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but serious birth complication wherein amniotic fluid enters the mother’s bloodstream. This triggers heavy bleeding from the mother, precipitating cardiorespiratory failure. 
 According to Nicole and her husband, Anthony, within moments of the embolism, Nicole had turned blue. She found herself unable to breathe. Though she was rushed into surgery, Nicole soon flatlined, and doctors told her heartbroken husband that they would have to perform a post-mortem c-section to save the baby. 
 The doctor on hand, Dr. Moats, was forced to open up Nicole’s body — without anesthesia or antiseptic. He also narrowly missed killing the baby, and accidentally sliced the child from shoulder to armpit with his scalpel. However, the baby fortunately managed to be delivered in good health. 
 But there was more to the story, however. Doctors were amazed when, out of nowhere, Nicole’s pulse seemed to return. It was faint, and she had lost between four and five liters of blood. However, doctors soon realized that they had a chance to save her. 
 The doctors performed an emergency hysterectomy to stop her bleeding, and kept her in the ICU to receive blood transfusions. Though Nicole remembers nothing about the event, she has since recovered. 
 A post shared by Before You Push (@beforeyoupush) on 
 Jan 17, 2019 at 5:27am PST 
 Since the traumatizing event, Nicole stated on Instagram that her new life mission is to help foster a dialogue which lets women know of the dangers of childbirth. 
 Loading... 
 “This was the first time I got to hold my baby boy in my arms just moments after being transferred out of ICU,” Nicole wrote in a poignant post. 
 “As a registered nurse for almost 7 years I feel like I now have a new mission in life. My patient care, education, and experience has propelled me now to want to help woman BEFORE they go into their delivery blindly. Women need to know that delivery is STILL DANGEROUS! People forget that. And even if they don’t…. they don’t want to talk about it.” 
  
 Nicole’s full story can be read on Mama Mia .

 Elton John’s musical biopic ‘Rocketman’ has hit Russian cinemas with a bit of a scandal. The singer criticized cutting out sex scenes as “censorship.” The culture ministry says it had nothing to do with the distributor’s decision. 
 “We reject in the strongest possible terms the decision to censor ‘Rocketman’ for the Russian market,” a post on the singer’s Facebook page says. “Paramount Pictures have been brave and bold partners in allowing us to create a film which is a true representation of Elton’s extraordinary life, warts and all.” It further laments that the audience was denied “the opportunity to see the film as it was intended.” 
 Russian moviegoers won’t see some scenes involving kissing and oral sex between men and drug use, amounting to around five minutes. The changes were made in accordance to the country’s laws, the distributor said. Russian legislation prohibits propaganda of homosexual relations and pornography to minors.",1

33495,"Introduction: The 13 Satanic Bloodlines that Rule the World 
 March 20, 2016 
 The 13 Satanic Bloodlines that Rule the World 
 The concept of Illuminati bloodlines was popularized by Christian Illuminati researcher Fritz Springmeier in his book Bloodlines of the Illuminati. 
 Springmeier utilizes the same elements common to all Illuminati conspiracies but adds his own spin: 13 generational Satanic bloodlines ruling all other elite groups and secret societies from the top of their pyramid of power. 
 ALL members of the Illuminati are Satanists. 
 ALL members of the Illuminati are subjected to trauma-based mind-control. 
 ALL members of the Illuminati have Multiple Personality Disorder. 
 When a member of an Illuminati bloodline reaches the age of 3, he or she is taken to meet an Illuminati Grande Mother, a high-level Satanic priestess. These meetings are held twice a year and are attended by all Illuminati families and their Mothers of Darkness. 
 The Grande Mother examines and evaluates seven Illuminati children. If the child is worthy of entry into the Illuminati, he or she is assigned to one of the Illuminati bloodlines. For each approved child, another is sacrificed and his or her blood is used to write the name of the newly-approved Illuminati child. 
 Fritz’s Illuminati structure looks like this: 
 Sources? Fritz gets most of his information from ex-illuminati and ex-Satanists such as John Todd and others which he has personally deprogrammed. His book The Illuminati Formula Used to Create an Undetectable Total Mind Controlled Slave was written in cooperation with one such ex-illuminati victim, Cisco Wheeler. 
 13 ILLUMINATI BLOODLINES 
 Satan himself blessed the twelve bloodlines of the Illuminati in mockery of God’s own Twelve Tribes of Israel. 
 The 13th bloodline of the Illuminati was infused with Satan’s own seed and passed down through the Satanic House of David and the French Merovingian bloodline – Fritz own twist on Holy Blood, Holy Grail and The Messianic Legacy. The Anti-Christ will be born from this 13th Satanic bloodline. 
 According to Fritz, the number 13 is extremely important to the Illuminati. Bermuda was denied entry into the Union because it was very important for the Illuminati to have 13 colonies. 
 The Thirteen Illuminati bloodlines are the  Astor  bloodline, the  Bundy  bloodline, the  Collins  bloodline, the  DuPont  bloodline, the  Freeman  bloodline, the  Kennedy  bloodline, the  Li  bloodline (李), the  Onassis  bloodline, the  Rockefeller  bloodline, the  Rothschild  bloodline, the  Russell  bloodline, the  Van Duyn  bloodline and the previously mentioned  Merovingian  bloodline. 
 The House of Rothschild is in charge of the Illuminati’s finance. The family always sets a place at the dinner table in case Satan decides to show up. (He wears a black tuxedo and only his cloven hooves are visible.) 
 The House of Rothschild played a major role in the Bavarian Illuminati. The Illuminati is much older than the 18th century Bavarian Illuminati and Fritz informs us that Adam Weishaupt as a person never existed. – Just another Illuminati trick! 
 The family also has a habit of spreading its bloodline outside the family by impregnating as many women as possible. 
 Both Abraham Lincoln and Adolph Hitler were part of a Rothschild secret breeding program.Abraham’s father,  Thomas  did not exist. Hitler’s grandmother was impregnated by a Rothschild. 
 Adolph Rothschild 
 Abraham Rothschild 
 Hitler’s occult power was preserved by an Illuminati insider who plunged a knife in Hitler’s heart and swallowed his last breath as Adolph died. 
 Despite the constant references to Satanism (which seem to have been added as an afterthought), the section on the Rothschilds included in Bloodlines of the Illuminati written by David Smith is an informative and concise history of the House of Rothschild. It contains little exaggeration and even dispels some of the most common Rothschild myths. i.e. Fritz’s own claim that the Rothschild played a major role in the Bavarian Illuminati. (see above) Smith writes that the House of Rothschild was not a significant power at the time of the Illuminati’s foundation. 
 Todd was the inspiration for 3 Chick Tracts: Spellbound , Angel of Light and Broken Cross . 
 The Collins are in charge of organizing the occult aspects of the Illuminati. In occult circles, the Collins family is higher in the hierarchy than both the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. 
 Fritz is one of the few people who doesn’t think that occultist  John Todd  (Lance Collins) is full of sh!t. Although John Todd and Springmeier differ on an important point: Todd has identified the AntiChrist as being Jimmy Carter, while Springmeier informs us that the Antichrist is yet to be born (or is still very young) from the 13th bloodline of the Illuminati. 
 It must have been very difficult for Fritz to determine exactly which Li (李 can be romanized as Li or Lee) were members of the Illuminati since Li is the  second most common Chinese surname  and one of the  most common English family name . Undeterred, Fritz is nevertheless able to identify the richest man in Asia, Li Ka-shing and General Lee (the Civil War general, not  the car ) as members of the Li Illuminati bloodline. 
 Li Ka-$hing 
 Bruce Lee doesn’t make the cut. 
 General Lee, Yup! 
 Sorry Jet 
 Springmeier admits that research into these Illuminati bloodlines is difficult as many of the Illuminati members do not have an Illuminati surname. As a result he lists a few Illuminati families closely tied to the 13 Illuminati families such as the Disney Bloodline, the Reynolds bloodline, McDonald bloodline (Bic Macs are not just bad for your health, they’re Satanically bad for you.) and the Krupp bloodline. 
 Also, families such as the Bacons, Bakers, Beattys, Bushes, Bronfmans, Cabots, Carnegies, Clintons, Dukes, Forbes, Mellons, Morgans, Payseurs, Vanderbilts, Warburgs, Watsons and the Whitneys (Basically anyone with money, which is pretty much Fritz’s M.O.,  and mine ) have intermarried with the top 13 Illuminati bloodlines and have managed to obtain significant power on their own. 
 At this point, you might have noticed that the “ancient” Illuminati bloodlines chosen by Satan himself before the birth of Christ are not very ancient at all. In fact, Fritz seems to focus mainly on families who have accumulated their fortune during the Gilded Age. Fritz informs us that the Rothschilds are able to trace their heritage to Babylon’s Nimrod and that the Astor family was known as the Astarte in Canaan. Blood is more important than surnames. 
 Keep in mind that a person born around the Middle Ages would have  over 1 billion ancestors today . In other words, we’re pretty much all related. (Everyone on earth is at most a 50th cousin. see  AJ Jacobs’TED lecture ) 
 MONARCH MIND CONTROL 
 Mind control plays an important part in Springmeier’s theory. The main method of mind control used by the Illuminati is what Springmeier calls Monarch Mind Control. Monarch is basically a perfect version of the very real and well documented  MK-Ultra and ARTICHOKE programs . In Springmeier’s view, and according to his numerous sources, the Illuminati have achieved 100% percent efficiency in using Mind Control. (See Cathy O’Brien’s  TranceFormation of America , another of Fritz’s sources) 
 Originally, only bloodlines of the Illuminati were able to survive the trauma necessary to splinter the mind onto multiple fragments, but thanks to the scientific advances made by Josef Mengele, the Illuminati is now able to create mind controlled slaves on a larger scale. According to Fritz, more than 2 million Americans are mind-controlled Illuminati slaves. 
 Despite his knowledge that Illuminati mind-controlled slaves are completely unaware that they are Illuminati mind-controlled slaves, Fritz warns his readers that exposure to information found in his book might inadvertently trigger hidden personalities resulting in death. 
 So… 
 WARNING: IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE that you suspect you are under the influence of mind control reading the following information can be DANGEROUS. STOP READING THIS ARTICLE. If you are consulting a therapist for DID (also known as MPD), it is recommended that you consult your therapist before reading this material. 
 Clinton giving Satanic Induction 
 Members of the Illuminati submit their own offspring to Illuminati mind control and torture. Mind Control typically begins when the children are 18 months old. Illuminati programmers begin subjecting victims to traumas which in turn causes the mind to splinter into fragments and create different independently programmable personalities. (Dissociative Identity Disorder) The trauma insures that “amnesia walls” are built between these thousands of personalities. 
 Each personality can then be programmed into anything the Illuminati wishes from sex slaves to geniuses pre-programmed to release a certain invention at a certain time in the future. The Illuminati is able to create photographic memories in its members by scaring their brain stem. 
 Marilyn Monroe was the first Mind-Controlled “Presidential Model” sex kitten which the Illuminati allowed the public to see. 
 Nazi scientist Josef Mengele perfected the science of mind control under Illuminati orders. In the 70’s the Illuminati started “externalizing the hierarchy” and began using mass mind control techniques which it is still perfecting to this day. David Koresh and Jim Jones were mind control test groups. 
 The millions of active mind-controlled slaves are unaware that they have been subjected to Monarch Mind Control. Every single member of the Illuminati have multiple personalities which allows information to be kept hidden in various compartment of the mind. Programmers are able to call up various personalities by using a combination of certain codes. 
 There are thousands of triggers all around us. The JFK assassinations and the 9/11 tragedy were meant to trigger some sort of process in mind-controlled victims. They are landmark events which cause trauma-based mind control on a mass scale. Traumatic events serve to program lies into people. Sleeper agents can be awakened at any time through trigger inserted in the media. The television is a Satanic altar. (Anton LaVey of the Church of Satan also called TV a “Satanic family altar”.) 
 The Amish is a perfect cover for Illuminati Mind controlled assassins. 
 All members of the Illuminati have had their hearts hypnotically replaced by a stone. This prevents them from giving their heart to Jesus and escaping the Illuminati as they believe that they are heartless. They are programmed that when they hear “Jesus loves you”, they hear “Jesus hates you”. The favorite front for Illuminati is as a Christian clergy. 
 Suicide programming might be triggered when attempting to deprogram a subject. Springmeier comments that he had to watch Cisco carefully as he was deprogramming because he could accidentally trigger one of her many suicide altars. She would then reach for the nearest knife or lethal drug in order to off herself. (Note to Fritz: Don’t leave lethal drugs and sharp objects lying around your suicidal mind-controlled victims.) 
 According to Springmeier and his high-level Satanist informants, the Illuminati have already achieved a New World Order and successfully use mind-controlled slaves on  their Mars colony . (2:25:45) 
 There are numerous programming sites throughout the United States such as Area 51 and other military base, Masonic Temples and prisons are often used for mind control. The Masonic House of the Temple is used both as a programming site and as a meeting place for the Grand Druid Council. 
 Theme parks such as Disneyland and Disney World are perfect programming sites. Young children riding roller coasters at theme parks are fitted with electroshock-rigged footwear which shock them at key moments making it easier to further split their personalities. Fritz informs us that the programmers use footwear because a cattle prod would most likely be noticed by other visitors at the theme parks. 
 At this point in Fantasia, the mind-controlled victim is given electroshocks in order to induce trauma. 
 The only way to deal with the trauma is to create split personalities. 
 Members of the bloodlines intentionally insert  Illuminati symbols  in popular movies and other media in order to bring what Fritz calls the “Externalisation of the Hierarchy”, a term borrowed from Alice Bailey book of the same name. 
 Walt Disney was commissioned by the Illuminati to produce films such as Fantasia and Alice in Wonderland for mind control purposes. Disney movies are the main films used in mind control but other films such as Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, Star trek and even the Holy Bible are used in Monarch Mind-Control Programming. 
 SATANISM 
 Mother of Goddess Castle 
 Each of the 13 Illuminati families has their own Satanic hierarchy which includes Mothers of Darkness, Illuminati Kings, Queens, Princes and Princesses. In the United States, the FBI is in charge of procuring victims for the Illuminati’s human sacrifices. 
 According to Fritz, Muno Castle near the southern border of Belgium is the site of some of the most horrendous Illuminati activities. On every single day, the Illuminati ritually sacrifices a pregnant woman and her child in the castle’s basement. Mothers of Darkness then drain the baby of its blood and fill quills which are used to write the Illuminati’s deeds (towards bringing the reign of Satan and the Antichrist) in a great white book. 
 The castle is the source of the “thousand points of light” which George W. Bush has referred to numerous times in his speeches. 
 Springmeier tells us that the secret of the castle’s location is highly guarded by members of the Illuminati. Fortunately for us, Google map is a  lot more accommodating . 
 Members of the Illuminati like to drink the blood of their human victims because the adrenaline released into the blood at the time of death gives the drinker an instant high. 
 Some members, such as Al Gore have become addicted to drinking human blood and carry blood with them at all times. There is a thriving black market for adrenochrome catering to Illuminati members. 
 DAVID ICKE AND REPTILIAN BLOODLINES 
 David Icke’s version of the Illuminati defers somewhat from Spring’s and involves Reptilian aliens which he first described as originating from the Draco constellation but later claimed they emanated from an alternate dimension. The idea was first introduced in his 1999 best-seller The Biggest Secret. 
 Icke essentially fuses the ancient astronauts ideas of Zecharia Sitchin with Fritz Springmeier and other conspiracy researchers’ ideas, namely Gary Allen’s 1972 classic, None Dare Call It Conspiracy. 
 The leader of the Illuminati is referred to as “the Pindar”, short for “Pinnacle of the Draco”. The current Pindar is a member of the Rothschild family. 
 Statue of Draco guarding the entrance to the City – the world’s financial Mecca – Coincidence? Icke says no. 
 David Icke’s 13 Illuminati families are: 
 Rothschild (Bauer or Bower) 
 Warburg (del Banco) 
 Windsor (Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) 
 According to Icke, the ruling families have Reptilian blood running through to their veins (the origin of the term “blue blood”) allowing them to shapeshift into their Reptilian forms and partake in blood sacrifice. Once again, according to Icke, feasting on new-born babies is considered an Illuminati delicacy.

71003,"Citing cleaning, county closes Hilo park favored by homeless 
 Published Saturday, June 1, 2019 | 9:04 a.m. 
 Updated 6 hours, 12 minutes ago 
 HILO, Hawaii (AP) — Hawaii County has temporarily closed a downtown Hilo park favored by homeless people as part of a ""deep sanitization"" to clean up litter and feces in the grassy waterfront space. 
 Mooheau Park closed Friday. It was not known when it will reopen but Maurice Messina, the deputy director of parks and recreation, predicted the closure would not last for more than a few days. 
 Mayor Harry Kim said the county needs to make sure the park is safe for families, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported. 
 ""It's way past time — and I stress way past time,"" he said. ""We got to put our foot down. 
 Kim added: ""We need to remind everyone that this is our home. It's not their toilet, it's not their camping ground, this is not your rubbish dump."" 
 The county needed to take action quickly because families and visitors were in an unclean environment, said Messina. 
 The issues have gotten worse and overwhelmed park maintenance staff, he said. 
 Workers will pressure-wash and scrub the park as well as pick up trash, he said. Messina described the cleanup as a ""deep sanitization."" 
 Sports teams and others with permits may still access the park during the closure. The park encompasses a commuter parking lot, practice fields and a bandstand. 
 Messina said a security guard will be posted at the park after it reopens.",1

 CINCINNATI -- The big climb back to respectability as an offense remains a steep one for the Reds after a painfully slow start that saw hitters unable to keep pace with the strong pitching from their own team. But the trend upward is definitely happening. 
 The Nationals had one of the best starters from one of the best rotations in the National League facing the Reds in lefty Patrick Corbin . He was out of the game in the third inning as Cincinnati pounced early and kept adding on for a 9-3 win on Friday at Great American Ball Park. 
 • Box score 
 “They’re swinging the bats really well. We knew that coming in, but we had Pat throwing tonight,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. 
 If hitting and pitching continue to be in sync, rising from the bottom of the NL Central standings could happen quickly for the Reds. Over their last 10 games, they are averaging 6.9 runs per game and have gone 6-4. 
 “We’re staying kind of on track on the pitching side and then the hitting is just unbelievable right now. Put those together and we’re going to start winning a lot of ballgames, I think,” said Reds starter Tyler Mahle , who pitched five innings for the victory. 
 In the bottom of the first inning, the first four batters hit singles against Corbin with Eugenio Suarez driving in Nick Senzel and Yasiel Puig’s single scoring Joey Votto . Curt Casali provided the biggest hit with one out when he slugged a three-run home run to left field to make it a 5-0 game. Ten batters went to the plate during the rally. 
 Corbin was in trouble again in the third as three more hits opened the inning, and he loaded the bases with no outs. Jose Iglesias scored when shortstop Trea Turner booted Kyle Farmer’s sharp grounder up the middle. Senzel’s one-out sacrifice fly and Votto’s lined RBI single off Turner’s glove made it 8-1 and forced Washington to go to its struggling bullpen. 
 “They have really good starting rotation. We know that going in,” said Casali, who went 3-for-4 and added an RBI double in the fourth inning before finishing a triple shy of the cycle. “We're trying to get them out of the game as quickly as possible, not that there's anything wrong with their bullpen. Their starters are their strength. For us to get into the bullpen early on Day 1 of the series is huge. I'm glad I could be part of that.” 
 As a club, the Reds are still ranked 12th in the NL with a .236 average. However, there are plenty of signs for people to become bullish about their offensive output. 
 • Cincinnati has collected 112 hits over the last 10 games, an average of 11.2 hits per game. Eight of the last nine games have featured double-digit-hit outputs. 
 • Votto is batting .483 (15-for-31) over his seven-game hitting streak and has raised his average from .208 to .253. 
 • The rookie and top organizational prospect, Senzel has found a home in the leadoff spot, something the Reds lacked the first five weeks of 2019. Over his first 26 games, the 23-year-old is batting .279/.347/.468 with four home runs. 
 • The Reds finished May with 45 home runs for the month, second-most in the NL. 
 “The offense is gaining confidence and everyone is contributing,” Reds manager David Bell said. 
 All of this is happening while the pitching staff is ranked second in the NL with a 3.71 ERA -- a massive turnaround from the past few seasons of mediocrity. 
 ""It was only a matter of time before we started hitting in bunches as you guys normally see us do because we have a great lineup,” Casali said. “The great difference this year is our pitchers are just awesome. They're doing a great job in keeping us in every single game."" 
 Why has the hitting surge been happening? 
 • Statcast shows that the Reds remain near the bottom of the Majors in hard-hit balls (27th) and barrels (tied for 18th). However, the team is making more contact.

 Top seed Osaka upset at French Open (0:23) 
 No. 1 seed Naomi Osaka is eliminated from the French Open after losing to Katerina Siniakova in the third round. (0:23) 
 print 
 PARIS -- This was one deficit too big to overcome for Naomi Osaka , whose Grand Slam winning streak is over. 
 The No. 1-ranked Osaka couldn't muster a comeback after falling way behind yet again at the French Open, losing 6-4, 6-2 in the third round to No. 42 Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic on Saturday. 
 ""I just feel like there has been a weight on me, kind of,"" said Osaka, who was seeded No. 1 at a major tournament for the first time. 
 She had won her past 16 matches at majors, allowing her to lift the trophies at the US Open last September and Australian Open in January. That run also included two victories at Roland Garros after trailing by a set and a break each time. 
 ""I could see,"" Siniakova said, ""that she's not so confident like she was.""

 No. 1 cruising at French, eyes 'Djoker Slam II' 
 But Osaka said Saturday that she felt tired and was dealing with a headache. 
 Her mounting mistakes just kept accumulating against Siniakova, who had never reached the fourth round in singles in 18 previous Slam appearances. She is better known for her doubles success, winning championships at the French Open and Wimbledon last year and topping the rankings. 
 She is the first woman ranked No. 1 in doubles to defeat the singles No. 1 in more than 30 years, according to the WTA: The last occasion was when Martina Navratilova beat Steffi Graf at the 1987 US Open. 
 ""I mean, it's incredible. It's amazing. It's the thing I couldn't believe,"" said Siniakova, who will face 2017 US Open runner-up Madison Keys next. ""It was my best tennis."" 
 It decidedly was not Osaka's, who quickly gathered her things and headed to the Court Suzanne Lenglen locker room when the lopsided match was finished. 
 She wound up with a hard-to-believe 38 unforced errors; Siniakova made only 13. 
 And Osaka, so good lately at the biggest moments on her sport's biggest stages, wasn't able to come up with the goods on the hottest day of the tournament so far, with the temperature topping 80 degrees (approaching 30 Celsius). 
 One key statistic: Osaka compiled seven break points in the first set but failed to convert a single one. She was 0 for 4 on break chances when Siniakova served out that set, then never managed to earn one in the second. 
 Clay has never been Osaka's best surface. Her power game is served better by the speed of hard courts, in particular. That's why she still has not made it to the round of 16 at the French Open. 
 The first tennis player from Japan to be ranked No. 1 thought she was better suited to contend this time and spoke about eyeing a third consecutive major title -- and moving halfway to a true Grand Slam. 
 ""It's weird, but I think me losing is probably the best thing that could have happened. I think I was overthinking this calendar Slam. For me, this is something that I have wanted to do forever,"" Osaka said. ""But I think I have to think about it like: If it was that easy, everyone would have done it. I just have to keep training hard and put myself in a position again to do it, hopefully."" 
 After going just 9-11 on clay over her career until this season, she was 9-1 in 2019 until Saturday's setback. 
 Osaka's exit, a day after No. 2 Karolina Pliskova lost, leaves defending champion Simona Halep , at No. 3, as the highest-seeded woman remaining. Halep needed only 55 minutes to get to the fourth round with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over No. 27 Lesia Tsurenko . 
 Keys, a semifinalist in Paris a year ago, advanced by beating qualifier Anna Blinkova 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-4.

 ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The Minnesota Twins are a hit — and getting hit. 
 Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and the Twins beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-3 Friday night in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. 
 Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game lead in the AL Central. 
 ""We don't want our guys getting nicked up or anything, but sometimes you take the baserunners any way you can,"" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. ""And sometimes it takes a base hit with men on base to kind of wake everyone up and get things going."" 
 José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. 
 ""It's something we've seen this year. In the games that we have not played our best or lost, we've come back the day after and really pulled together and played good baseball,"" Baldelli said. ""It's what we've come to expect. I think we have the type of guys that regardless of what happens today, they'll be ready to play tomorrow."" 
 Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. 
 The Twins have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. They trailed 3-1 in the fifth before Polanco drove in a run with his second double and scored on a single by Willians Astudillo. 
 Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout. Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo plunked Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. 
 Kolarek, a left-hander, relieved to face the left-handed hitting Rosario, and Rosario grounded an opposite-field single to left, past the spot vacated when third baseman Christian Arroyo shifted toward shortstop. 
 Rogers (2-1) retired his first six batters, allowed Daniel Robertson's two-out single in the ninth, then retired Mike Zunino on a groundout. 
 Berríos struck out eight in 6 2/3 innings, allowing three runs and three hits. 
 Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. 
 Astudillo had an RBI single in the first, but Kevin Kiermaier's two-run homer in the second put the Rays ahead. Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. 
 × 
 Astudillo was thrown out at the plate by Kiermaier while trying to score on C.J. Cron's two-out double to center. 
 SCARY 
 Rays pitcher Emilio Pagán was hit on the right cheek by a line drive off Schoop's bat in the sixth but remained in the game. 
 ""I was lucky,"" Pagan said. ""Probably my No. 1 fear, most pitchers will agree, that a ball coming back at you is not a fun situation to be in. It could have gotten me on my hand a lot more serious, and it definitely could have hit me in the face a lot harder."" 
 SHORT BENCH 
 Tampa Bay played with C Travis d'Arnaud as the only healthy backup. Outfielders Tommy Pham (right leg cramp) and Avisail Garcia (overall body soreness/hamstrings) were limited to pinch hitting. 
 TRAINER'S ROOM 
 Twins: Polanco was at DH after missing Thursday's game due to illness. 
 Rays: C Zunino (strained left quadriceps) was reinstated from the 10-day IL and C Erik Kratz was designated for assignment. ... INF Yandy Díaz (bruised left hand) was sent to extended spring training. ... INF Matt Duffy, out all season with a strained left hamstring, said a specialist he saw this week found no structural damage. Duffy could resume jogging Monday.

 Will the Knicks draft R.J. Barrett at No. 3 or trade back?

Both options are still on the table, but a third option has emerged too — trading back in the first round to collect more draft picks, with an eye toward better building a roster around potential marquee free agent signings.

New York is weighing the move in an effort to acquire pieces that would ""better complement"" star free agents like Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving.

This means that the Knicks will not have the opportunity to take Duke standout Zion Williamson, but they will have the chance to take his teammate. The question, however, is wh...

 Knicks Rumors: RJ Barrett declines Grizzlies workout; 'excited' for New York 
 RJ Barrett has his sights set on the New York Knicks, so he reportedly declined a pre-draft workout with the Memphis Grizzlies. The NBA Draft is usually not as predictable as free agency, but Zion Williamson, Ja Morant and RJ Barrett — in that order — seem like the first three picks in June's selection show. The New York Knicks have the third overall selection and seem lined up to take Barrett. With this potentially inevitable, even if the Knicks explore their options, Barrett already declined a workout with the No. 2 pick in the draft, the Memphis Grizzlies, according to ESPN's Jonathan Gi...

 New York Knicks: Why the team should draft Darius Garland over RJ Barrett 
 No matter how the New York Knicks offseason pans out, the 3rd pick will have to play off the ball, and Darius Garland is better suited for that role than RJ Barrett There is a growing sentiment around the league that the New York Knicks will select RJ Barrett with the third overall pick in the draft. For example, in his latest mock draft, Reid Forgrave of CBS Sports had the organization selecting Barrett in the first round: But let the record show that I think he's closer to another player that executives and scouts have said they see shades of: James Harden, a slithery and creative scorer...

 RJ Barrett Reveals His Thoughts On Playing For The New York Knicks 
 Patrick Smith/Getty Images Despite their fans insistence that they would come away with the first overall pick in the draft, the New York Knicks ended up with the third pick instead. It is believed that Zion Williamson will go number one to the New Orleans Pelicans, while Ja Morant will end up with the Memphis Grizzlies at two. RJ Barrett is considered to be the third best player available in the draft which leads many to believe that the Knicks will select the young Duke Blue Devils star. With the NBA Draft going down on June 20th, Barrett explained just how excited he is and how he would ...

 New York Knicks NBA Draft Picks and History: 2011 
 The 2011 NBA Draft brought the New York Knicks a first-round pick, and it was a productive player in their playoff years. 2010-11 brought the New York Knicks to the postseason for the first time in seemingly an eternity. They had a still-healthy Amar'e Stoudemire and the in-his-prime Carmelo Anthony, so this team reached the playoffs and created some excitement for this city's basketball. With the positive record, the Knicks owned the No. 17 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft. It was their first opening-round selection since 2009, when Jordan Hill became the guy at No. 8.

 On MSG 150, UConn's Danny Hurley spoke highly of New York Knicks draft target RJ Barrett. With the third pick of the 2019 NBA Draft, the New York Knicks will have the chance to select a difference-maker. Maybe not Zion Williamson, perhaps even Ja Morant, but others who made an impact on college basketball in the 2018-19 season or have the most tantalizing upside of the remaining prospects. RJ Barrett potentially leads that list. While not the most hyped Duke star, he was a talented No. 2 to Williamson as the Blue Devils marched to the top overall seed in the NCAA Tournament.

 Warning signs are posted near a gate to the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, in Plymouth, Mass., Tuesday, May 28, 2019. The operators of the nuclear plant performed a simulated shutdown at a training facility several miles from the reactor Tuesday, in advance of the actual shutdown of the aging reactor planned for Friday, May 31. 
 Steven Senne 
 PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) — The Pilgrim nuclear power plant in Plymouth has permanently shut down after 47 years of generating electricity, bring to a close the era of nuclear power in Massachusetts. 
 The final shutdown occurred at 5:28 p.m. Friday. 
 Entergy announced in 2015 it would retire Massachusetts' only remaining reactor, citing competition from less expensive energy sources. 
 Entergy had said the shutdown would take about five hours with technicians first reducing Pilgrim's power output from the 40% to 26% to about 8%, before launching the final step of inserting control rods into the fuel assembly to seal off further nuclear reactions. 
 The focus now turns to the daunting task of cleaning up and dismantling the plant. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is reviewing Entergy's proposal to sell Pilgrim to a private nuclear waste management firm that promises a speedier decommissioning. 
 The closing leaves Seabrook in New Hampshire and Millstone in Connecticut as New England's only still-operating commercial nuclear plants. 
 ——— 
 A closer look at Pilgrim's shutdown: 
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR REGIONAL ENERGY SUPPLIES? 
 Pilgrim's retirement and the loss of its 680 megawatts of power aren't likely to disrupt overall regional energy supplies or the reliability of the electrical grid, according to experts. 
 ISO-New England, which operates the region's bulk power system, says three new power plants that can burn either natural gas or oil will be online by this summer and several small solar facilities and a new wind farm will also help absorb the impact. 
 ""We've actually seen more megawatts coming in than the megawatts of Pilgrim that are leaving,"" said Anne George, a vice president for ISO. 
 The shutdown could result in a short-term increase in carbon emissions because of the greater reliance on the gas and oil-burning plants, she added, though longer range trends point to growth in cleaner, renewable energy sources. 
 It's unclear whether Pilgrim's closing could affect consumer prices. George noted that nuclear power generally enters the electricity market at lower prices than most other fuels. 
 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? 
 It's far from certain how decommissioning will unfold. 
 Entergy announced plans last year to sell Pilgrim, along with several other retiring U.S. reactors, to Holtec International for decommissioning. The deals are awaiting NRC approval. 
 Holtec is promising an aggressive schedule for cleaning up and removing the physical plant within eight years at an estimated cost of $1.1 billion. Absent the sale, Entergy would place Pilgrim into so-called ""safe storage"" mode under a $1.6 billion decommissioning plan that could last up to 60 years. 
 Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey has raised several concerns about the proposed sale and has requested NRC hold public hearings before signing off. 
 Holtec has never owned a commercial nuclear plant. 
 WHERE DOES RADIOACTIVE FUEL GO? 
 Pilgrim's more than 4,000 spent fuel rod assemblies will initially be placed in ""wet storage"" — essentially large pools of water where the superhot fuel is cooled for at least two years. 
 Next comes the ""dry storage"" phase: The spent fuel is transferred into giant metal and concrete-reinforced cylinders that stay at the site unless or until a national nuclear waste storage facility is created. 
 Existing storage casks are kept on a pad adjacent to the reactor, roughly 300 feet (91 meters) from ocean's edge and 25 feet (7.6 meters) above sea level. Plans are in the works to build a larger pad and relocate it about 75 feet above sea level, in part as protection from flooding or erosion induced by climate change. 
 WHO PAYS FOR DECOMMISSIONING? 
 U.S. reactors are required to maintain decommissioning trust funds to cover the facilities' eventual decontamination and dismantling. 
 Public records show Pilgrim's fund was most recently valued at just over $1 billion. 
 Unused portions of the fund can continue to grow during decommissioning, but it's unclear what might happen should the money run out before the job is complete. Holtec has offered assurances it has financial resources to cover unexpected delays or cost overruns. 
 HOW IS PLYMOUTH IMPACTED? 
 Decommissioning requires fewer employees and Pilgrim's workforce is expected to fall from the current 580 to about 270 by March 2020. 
 In addition to losing jobs, Plymouth will also receive less revenue from the plant, even as the historic town prepares for celebrations marking the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower landing in 1620. 
 Town Meeting voters recently approved an agreement calling for payments in lieu of taxes of $7 million next fiscal year and $6.5 million the following year. Plymouth is getting $8.5 million from Pilgrim in this fiscal year.

 The Top Mom-Invented Baby Products 
 From tools that warm breast milk to toys that stop tantrums in their tracks, here are 15 must-have products all created by inspiring moms.

 Each year a new crop of amazing baby products is born — and these days, more and more of them are being invented by some pretty inspiring mamas. 
 When you're taking care of your baby, how many times do you think, ""Wow, I could really use a so and so to help me with this baby thang!"" Maybe once, maybe many times. Either way, I find it incredible that so many moms come up with unique and innovative ideas for baby products. And then actually follow through and create a business. That's some serious work and planning in between diaper changes! The only fun product I created as a mom was a ring made out of play dough. 
 If a product has been invented by a mom, it gets an extra seal of approval from me. Here are some of the best products out there invented by some kick-butt moms: 
 Freemie Hands-Free Breast Pump 
 Founded by a female doctor with newborn preemies, this is a hands-free breast pump that lets you walk around and do whatever you need to be doing as you're collecting breast milk. Only a mom could think up this brilliant idea! 
 Aden + Anais 
 Just about every mom I know has heard of this brand of wraps and blankets made from organic muslin. Mom Raegan Moya-Jones, who was raised in Australia where muslin wraps were common, introduced her first wrap in 2006, and her soft, lightweight products have been a hit with moms ever since. 
 Belly Bandit 
 When Lori Caden was struggling with her post-pregnancy weight, she and her sisters teamed up to create a post-pregnancy shapewear collection. The products are dedicated to making moms look and feel their best, because that is exactly what we need post-baby! 
 Bare Baby Bottle 
 Priska Diaz, originally from Peru, designed these bottles that feed babies air-free milk while in an upright position, allowing babies to control the flow and pace of feeding. The air-free bottles reduce issues with acid reflux and have nipples that extend to mimic breastfeeding. How brilliant is that? 
 Simple Wishes Hands-Free Pumping Bra 
 Invented by sisters and moms who wanted to help support women as they breastfeed, these are a collection of bras that help you nurse and pump. When nursing or pumping, these bras easily adjust and pull off the breast, which is extremely helpful. 
 Baby Merlin Sleep Suit 
 This suit saved us when our son graduated from the swaddle but was still flailing his hands when he slept and continually woke himself up. The suit, which was created by a mother of four, positions babies so their arms are gently weighted down — and it also helps them sleep longer. And babies sleeping longer is everything to a mama! 
 Milk Stork 
 Kate Torgersen needed to go away on a four-day business trip and still get her breastmilk to her babies, so she came up with the idea for the Milk Stork. It's a delivery service for busy, traveling moms who are also breastfeeding. 
 Nanobebe 
 Alright, this one was invented by a dad, but they count too! This bottle feeds breastmilk out of the bottle without killing its nutrients. The dad came up with the idea in the middle of the night when his son was hungry and he couldn't heat the breastmilk he had fast enough without damaging its properties. 
 Tantrum Fix 
 A mom of two created a portable kit when you're out and about to help you deal with tantrums in a respectful way. It includes things like a book to teach your child about emotions, a step-by-step plan method book for you, a time out bottle, a puzzle and bubbles. We all need this kit!",1

 To move court against against implementation of the Khader panel report 
 Teachers and service organisations owing allegiance to the Opposition are on the warpath against the government decision to implement the recommendations of the Khader Commission appointed for restructuring school education. 
 A meeting of teachers and service organisations convened by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala here on Friday decided to boycott the State and district-level Pravesanotsavam (school reopening festival) on June 6. It also decided to boycott the higher secondary-level festival. 
 Letters by Mr. Chennithala would be given to parents in schools. The same evening, education protection meetings will be held at all district centres. 
 The meeting decided to boycott Minister for General Education C. Ravindranath and all his programmes. Teacher training programmes, meetings called by the Minister and officials, and all official programmes of the department would be given the miss. 
 An Assembly march would be taken out on June 20. Teachers said they would approach the court against the implementation of the “incomplete” report. 
 Mr. Chennithala said undue haste in implementing the report without any parleys with legislators and people would destroy the general education sector. 
 Only one part of the report had been submitted. Implementing its recommendations without waiting for the rest of the report would put students’ future at stake. The government was trying to concentrate power in times of decentralisation. The report was being implemented to push the interests of the CPI(M) teachers’ organisation, he alleged.

 PSA: Beware of people pretending to be from social security 
 BY JOHN JOHNSTON Social Security Public Affairs Specialist

 Save 
 Social Security is committed to protecting your personal information. We urge you to always be cautious and to avoid providing sensitive information such as your Social Security number or bank account information to unknown people over the phone or internet. If you receive a call and aren’t expecting one, you must be extra careful. You can always get the caller’s information, hang up, and — if you do need more clarification — contact the official phone number of the business or agency that the caller claims to represent. Never reveal personal data to a stranger who called you. 
 There’s a scam going around right now. You might receive a call from someone claiming to be from Social Security or another agency. Calls can even display 1-800-772-1213, Social Security’s national customer service number or even a local SSA office number, as the incoming number on your caller ID. In some cases, the caller states that Social Security does not have all of your personal information, such as your SSN, on file. Other callers claim Social Security needs additional information so the agency can increase your benefit payment, or that Social Security will terminate your benefits if they do not confirm your information. This appears to be a widespread issue, as reports have come from people across the country. These calls are not from Social Security. 
 Callers sometimes state that your SSN is at risk of being deactivated or deleted. The caller then asks you to call a phone number to resolve the issue. People should be aware that the scheme’s details may vary; however, you should avoid engaging with the caller or calling the number provided, as the caller might attempt to acquire personal information. 
 Social Security employees occasionally contact people by telephone for customer-service purposes. In only a very few special situations, such as when you have business pending with us, will a Social Security employee request that the person confirm personal information over the phone. 
 Social Security employees will never threaten you or promise a Social Security benefit approval or increase in exchange for information. In those cases, the call is fraudulent, and you should just hang up. If you receive these calls, please report the information to the Office of the Inspector General at 1-800-269-0271 or online at oig.ssa.gov/report . 
 Protecting your information is an important part of Social Security’s mission. You work hard and make a conscious effort to save and plan for retirement. Scammers try to stay a step ahead of us, but with an informed public and your help, we can stop these criminals before they cause serious financial damage.",1

 Virginia Beach City Manager Dave Hansen, left, Virginia Beach Chief of Police James Cervera, center, and Mayor Bobby Dyer listen during a news conference Saturday, June 1, 2019 in Virginia Beach, Va. DeWayne Craddock, a longtime city employee, opened fire at the municipal building Friday before police shot and killed him, authorities said. The Virginian-Pilot via AP Bill Tiernan

It's the nightmare scenario that gun-control advocates have warned about amid efforts in recent years to ease restrictions on the devices, which they say can help shooters escape detection and inflict more carnage. 
 But gun-rights advocates and most law enforcement experts say DeWayne Craddock's use of a suppressor likely had no bearing on his ability to kill so many people in so little time Friday. 
 Virginia is among 42 states that allow residents to purchase and possess suppressors, though some cities and towns — including Virginia Beach — prohibit them. 
 Known colloquially as a ""silencer,"" a suppressor was attached to the .45-caliber handgun that police say the shooter used to kill a dozen people on three floors of the building where he worked before police closed in and, after a protracted gunbattle, fatally shot him.

 That could at least partially explain why survivors of the attack said they were caught off guard and initially puzzled by what was happening. One described hearing something that sounded like a nail gun. 
 ""This is the concern we were talking about when Republicans were trying to deregulate silencers as 'ear protection,'"" said David Chipman, a retired agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and now the senior policy adviser with Giffords, a gun-control lobbying group. 
 ""Especially on a handgun, a suppressor will distort the sound in such a way that it would not immediately be recognizable as gunfire to people who sort of know what that sound is."" 
 Others say the shooter's use of a silencer was less of a factor in enabling him to carry out the rampage than was his familiarity with the building and even possibly his military background, both of which may have given him a tactical advantage. 
 ""A suppressor does not alter the lethality of the weapon at all. All it does is just limit the noise it makes,"" said Gregory Shaffer, a retired FBI agent who was a member of the bureau's elite Hostage Response Team. ""It doesn't increase the rate of fire. It doesn't do anything other than make it more comfortable to shoot because it's not so loud."" 
 It's not immediately clear how long Friday's attack lasted, or how much time passed before the first police officers arrived. The police department is in the same complex as the building where the shooting took place. 
 It also wasn't yet known how Craddock got the suppressor he used on his handgun, though authorities have said he legally purchased multiple firearms recently. 
 Authorities have three days to conduct a background check when someone is buying a firearm. But suppressors are regulated by the National Firearms Act, which also governs the sale of machine guns, and the extensive background check can take upward of eight months or more before the sale can go through. 
 Despite the barriers, suppressors have gained in popularity. In 2008, when West Valley City, Utah-based SilencerCo was formed, about 18,000 of the devices were being sold each year. The company, which controls an estimated 70 percent of the market, sells roughly that many each month. 
 Nicknamed ""cans,"" the devices were invented in the early 1900s by MIT-educated Hiram Percy Maxim, who also invented a muffler for gasoline engines. They were brought under NFA regulations after Depression-era game wardens expressed concern that hunters would use them to poach. 
 A suppressor does not eliminate the sound a gun makes but generally diminishes it by 20 to 35 decibels, leaving most guns still louder than your average ambulance siren. 
 ""Clearly this was an individual who did understand and have experience with firearms and had given potentially some forethought into the advantage that using a suppressor would offer him, particularly the suppressor coupled with the caliber of weapon he was using,"" said Thor Eells, executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association and a retired law enforcement officer with the Colorado Springs Police Department, where he oversaw a SWAT division. 
 Some have questioned how secure the building was where police say the shooter and all but one of his victims worked. A government facility, the building is open to the public, but security passes are required to enter inner offices, conference rooms and other work areas, officials said. 
 As a current employee, the shooter would have had such a pass and would have known the floor plan, areas that were ""easy to control,"" where the best places to hide were and how to move quickly from one area to another, Eells said. 
 While responding police might have had some familiarity with the building, it's very possible the shooter knew it a lot better after working there for years. 
 His protracted gunfight with law enforcement officers would indicate that he ""was in a place that was difficult for officers to access or engage,"" Eells said. 
 ""Whether that was happenstance or intentional, it's too early to tell.""",1

 Cubs extra: One left for Yu Darvish, extend protective netting and a Tommy La Stella encore 
 Nobody’s getting more out of MLB’s home run boom than La Stella — who has as many as every Cub on the roster at his position combined. 
 Did you know: After pitching at Busch Stadium in St. Louis Friday — and driving in a run, no less — Yu Darvish has pitched in every current major-league ballpark except one. Which one?

 DID YOU KNOW 
 In six games in the state of Texas this season, the Cubs hit 16 homers and scored 41 runs – but won only twice. “We know we can hit here. So have to pitch better in Texas,” manager Joe Maddon said this past week in Houston – at which point he was reminded the Cubs are done in Texas. “Hopefully, there might be another opportunity another time if everything works out well,” he said with a smirk. 
 Until Friday, Cubs starter Yu Darvish never had pitched in St. Louis in 150 career starts. He now has pitched in 29 of the existing ballparks. The one that’s left? Strangely, it’s also in the NL Central: PNC Park in Pittsburgh, where the Cubs have nine games remaining this year. 
 THAT’S WHAT HE SAID 
 “People don’t realize how hard it is to react to a baseball. So it would help. Stadiums know they can’t necessarily control how fast the game is. But if there’s anything to do, I guess that would be it. I’m not the stadium police, but I don’t know any other way to stop that from happening.” —Cubs right-fielder Jason Heyward in support of extending protective netting at ballparks after a small girl was hospitalized after being hit by a foul ball during Wednesday’s Cubs-Astros game.

 “Our fielders can barely react at times with a hard line drive. To expect a parent or kid to react to a ball that flies into the stands, it’s not realistic. …The idea of getting hurt should not be at all a part of [going to a game].” —Cubs general manager Jed Hoyer, another supporter more netting, talking on 670-AM the day after the Houston incident. 
 “I can’t explain it, and I’m not really going to search for the answers. I’ll just stay out of the way.” —Angels manager Brad Ausmus on former Cub Tommy La Stella’s out-of-nowhere offensive production this season. The Angels return to Wrigley — where La Stella was treated to a video board tribute — for a rainout makeup game Monday 
 “We’re well past the point of still congratulating ourselves and being happy about Kris [Bryant] and Kyle [Schwarber] and those guys that made it up here. …We need to be better with where we are in our time frame with the major-league club. We know we need to infuse more talent out of the major-league draft and internationally.” — Jason McLeod, the Cubs’ top scouting and player development executive, whose department drafts 27th overall in Monday’s first round. 
 “I really was off mechanically early. I started feeling better physically, and that’s always going to help your mental approach. I felt more confident.” — Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks on the difference between April (1-4, 5.33 ERA) and May (4-0, 1.81) for him. 
 HIDDEN FIGURES 
 50.0 – Cubs’ percentage of converted save opportunities (11-for-22), the second-worst mark in the National League. 
 16 – Earned runs allowed by Cubs ace Jon Lester in 14 innings (16.71 ERA) over his last three starts, all losses, after producing a 1.16 ERA his first seven. 
 12 – Home runs (through Thursday) by former Cub Tommy La Stella, who had 10 in his career before this year. He had as many as teammate Mike Trout until Trout eked past him with No. 13 on Friday; and La Stella has more than Paul Goldschmidt, Bryce Harper or Mookie Betts, and as many combined as Cubs infielders David Bote, Addison Russell and Daniel Descalso. 
 .899 – Career OPS vs. right-handed pitchers for Carlos Gonzalez, the three-time All-Star signed this week to a low-cost, dice-roll deal by the Cubs – who play in the right-hand-heavy NL Central.

 God was Harry Stewart’s co-pilot. He swears by that. 
 He survived 43 combat missions during World War II and is one of only a dozen remaining Tuskegee Airmen from the famed “Red Tails” fighter group still alive. 
 He turns 95 on July 4 and said he’ll never forget his days escorting B-17 and B-24 bombers over Italy, Germany and Austria, taking on enemy fighters in his P-51 Mustang.

 “It was very cold up there and the missions were tiring because they were quite long. They lasted anywhere from five to six-and-a-half hours, and when we got back to the base all we could think of doing was hitting the sack and getting some rest and being prepared for the next day’s mission,” the retired lieutenant colonel said. 
 Being shot down and captured was not an option. The black Tuskegee Airmen were showing the world bigotry didn’t belong — except down below. 
 On April 1, 1945, hate showed its face once again. 
 “There were seven of us and we were going after targets of opportunity in Austria,” he said of the day his squad got into a dogfight with German fighter pilots. 
 “Three of us got shot down. One was able to make it back to friendly territory before he crash-landed, one was killed outright when he was shot down and the third one, his plane was damaged so badly that he had to bail out,” said Stewart. 
 That pilot was captured and lynched three days later by an angry mob. 
 “The crowd, after being agitated by the SS troops, they broke into the jail and took this downed pilot out and they beat him badly first and then hung him from a lamppost. His name was Walter Manning,” Stewart said. “He was a very dynamic person. He was, I remember, a great swimmer. Lord knows what he would have done had he been able to survive the war.” 
 Stewart — one of the Heroes of a Generation the Herald is chronicling — almost faced the same fate that day over Austria. 
 “I realized (as tracer bullets whizzed by him) somebody was shooting at me. A German fighter plane was on my tail and I thought sure that I had had it,” Stewart said. 
 He dove for the ground, pulling up at the last second as the German fighter on his tail crashed nose-first in a ball of flames. 
 “Somebody was with me. I guess it was God as my co-pilot there because that guy should have had me,” he added. “I was about to give up the ghost.” 
 Stewart lives in Michigan now but once trained in Massachusetts at Westover Air Force base in Chicopee and flew with fellow pilots from all over New England. He has a book coming out next week about his days as a Tuskegee Airman. It’s called “Soaring to Glory.” 
 It’s a fascinating tale of a teenage boy in a segregated America defying the odds and proving himself 30,000 feet above the Earth as the world was at war. 
 “I subdued those feelings that I might have had about racial prejudice and committed to the mission,” he said of escorting bombers. “There were 10 lives on board each of those bombers that we were protecting. So anytime we intercepted an enemy fighter and stopped them from shooting the bomber down, we potentially saved 10 lives, and that was 10 American lives, fellow Americans and I was not thinking about some of the segregation that was going on at the time back in the states.” 
 As the story goes, the men on those bombers quickly came to love seeing the Red Tails pull alongside.

 “We were like their guardian angels,” Stewart said. 
 Those long missions, he added, were exercises in perseverance — a shared trait of all the Tuskegee Airmen. 
 “It was cold … maybe 50 to 60 degrees below zero. … And you’re trapped in the cockpit and you cannot really move,” Stewart said of his single-seat Mustang. “Sometimes coming back from a mission … I would invert the plane, turn it over on its back then so actually I was hanging by my safety strap. 
 “That was such a relief, to go ahead and hang from the safe strap. It was like somebody rubbing your back,” he said, remembering like it was yesterday. “I couldn’t stay in that position for too long, it was only for a second and then turn the plane back over upright again.” 
 Stewart is retired now from his mechanical engineering job with a pipeline company. He was recently invited back to Austria, where the townsfolk of Linz honored the memory of his fellow Tuskegee Airman. 
 “They wanted to make amends for what had happened, what the civilians had done to Walter Manning, and they were doing a commemoration and setting up a very nice memorial for him,”Stewart said. “It was very inspirational.” 
 His days as a Tuskegee Airman come back to Stewart in a dream, he said. But he’s most proud that he showed the world that patriotism transcends race.

 Public pressure prompts Ohio library to cancel LGBTQ event 
 Jun 1, 2019 
 Save 
 NEWARK, Ohio (AP) — Public opposition that included Ohio's Republican House speaker has prompted a county library outside Columbus to cancel an LGBTQ program for teens. 
 The Newark Advocate reports the Friday event at the Licking County Library in Newark was scheduled ahead of the city's Pride festival next weekend. It was supposed to feature a tutorial on drag queen makeup, crafts, games and a safe sex program. 
 It drew criticism on social media and a letter from Rep. Larry Householder, who vented about the makeup tips and called the event a ""stunningly bizarre breach of the public trust."" 
 The Newark Ohio Pride Coalition responded by saying the program was privately funded.

 Cold spring has delayed planting of many crops in the Maritimes 
 CTV Atlantic 
 Published Saturday, June 1, 2019 1:19PM ADT 
 Last Updated Saturday, June 1, 2019 1:25PM ADT 
 Most Maritimers have waited for months for warmer weather to arrive. 
 Anyone trying to grow a crop, or do much of anything outdoors, is saying June can't be much worse than May. 
 Kier Miller examines corn seed planted Thursday in a field near Sussex, N.B. -- seeding that should have been done weeks ago. 
 “Typically, this time of the year, in a more normal year, we would be 75 to 80 percent done the acres that we seed each year,” Miller said. “Right now, I would say, we're probably at about 15 percent.” 
 The Nova Scotia Federation of Agriculture says planting is also way behind schedule because fields are still wet and cold soil temperatures would hinder plant germination. 
 “The cold is the bigger issue, rather than the moisture,” Miller says. 
 On a much smaller scale, a community garden in Saint John has yet to put tomato plants and other varieties in the ground. 
 “We wait until after the last frost before we put in any starter plants that would be damage by frost,” said gardener Mike Roberts. 
 That’s a good thing, since there was another frost warning covering the Saint John area and other parts of the Maritimes Friday night. 
 All over the Maritimes, the month of May brought out far more umbrellas than sunshine. 
 Friday was no different in Halifax. 
 “This does not feel like summer at all,” said one pedestrian on Spring Garden Road.  “It feels like early spring or late fall or something.” 
 Outdoor patios and restaurants have lots of water, but no customers. 
 ""I wish it was a little bit nicer,” said a visitor to downtown Halifax. “I haven't been in Halifax before in the summer, but it sure doesn't look promising with this.” 
 May was a bit of a washout for anyone in the tourism business too. 
 “No question, the weather has been a havoc,” said Terry Stevens of Saint John Adventures. “But it is what it is. People are cold, people are wet, they don't want to participate. I'm hoping for a long hot summer.” 
 That’s a hope shared by anyone watching for a change in the weather. 
 “I remember when I started farming, how many eons ago, I can remember calling my dad on the 29th of April and saying: ‘I’m done seeding.’” 
 But this year, it’s a job that is still far from finished this year.

 Bell caps historic month in style, Pirates top Brewers 9-4 
 Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times as the Pittsburgh Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin in a 9-4 victory.

 By WILL GRAVES 
 AP Sports Writer 
 PITTSBURGH (AP) - Josh Bell spent some time in the seats above the Clemente Wall in right field at PNC Park on Friday night, carefully folding a handful of gold T-shirts with the phrase ""Bellieve"" on them over the chairs as part of a promotion that is doubling as an All-Star Game push for the scorching Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman. 
 The 26-year-old stressed, however, that he only laid out a couple of shirts. Three maybe. Four, tops. Team employees handed out the rest. Bell had other things to do pregame, namely sticking to the routine that helped him put together one of the most remarkable months in the franchise's long history. 
 AlertMe 
 Bell had two of Pittsburgh's 13 hits - all singles - in Pittsburgh's 9-4 victory over Milwaukee on Friday night. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. His 94 total bases during the month are the most by any Pirate in any month ever. Heady territory considering Pittsburgh started playing baseball a century - and then some - before Bell was born. 
 ""I feel like I'm just riding the wave,"" Bell said. 
 One that doesn't appear close to cresting. 
 Bell's total base mark broke Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner's record of 92 set in June, 1947. Bell is also one of only three players in National League history to have 12 home runs and 12 doubles in the same month, joining Hall of Famers Frank Robinson and Hank Aaron. 
 ""He pushes himself,"" Pittsburgh pitcher Chris Archer (2-5) said of Bell after picking up his first victory since April 7. ""If he gets out, he's mad. He's hitting .340 and he's angry that he's got out, which continues to keep him motivated. He's not content. We've got four months left in the season and I expect to see big things from him going forward."" 
 Bell didn't provide any big blasts Friday night, but contributed to a flood of small ones as the Pirates jumped on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin to win for just the fourth time in 11 games. Starling Marte had three hits and scored three times and Kevin Newman went 2 for 5 with two RBIs to extend his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games. 
 SHAKY CHACIN 
 Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command abandoned him in the third inning. The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh's lead to 5-1. Freddy Peralta replaced Chacin and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh's advantage to 7-1. 
 Chacin - a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series - saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. 
 ""I just lost my focus in that inning,"" Chacin said. ""That never happened to me before, walking guys with the bases loaded like that. I need to start to do a better job if I want to keep pitching."" 
 Something that might not be guaranteed. Asked if Chacin might need a break, Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said only: ""We've got to figure out how to get him pitching the way he's capable of."" 
 ARCHER REBOUNDS 
 Archer came in winless since early April, a stretch that's watched the centerpiece of a deal that sent Tyler Glasnow and Austin Meadows to Tampa Bay search for answers. He seemed to find some in a bullpen session in Cincinnati while throwing to Jacob Stallings. Stallings encouraged Archer to rely more on his fastball, and Archer responded by striking out seven with two walks in seven innings. He gave up a solo home run to Jesus Aguilar in the third and a three-run shot to Keston Hiura in the fourth but settled down afterward. 
 ""I'm going to stay relentless,"" Archer said. ""I've been doing this a long time. I'm not going to let (a slump) define me."" 
 TRAINER'S ROOM 
 Brewers: C Manny Pina (right hamstring discomfort) is expected to rejoin Milwaukee over the weekend. 
 Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles (left hamstring discomfort) will start Sunday's series finale. ... RHP Keone Kela will be shut down for 10 days after the right shoulder discomfort that sent him to the injured list popped back up during a rehab assignment.

 Hughes passes on Combine fitness testing, 'needed a bit of a break' 
 Hughes passes on Combine fitness testing, 'needed a bit of a break' 
 Projected No. 1 pick in NHL Draft less than 100 percent after two postseason tournaments 
 by                                             Mike G. Morreale @mikemorrealeNHL / NHL.com Staff Writer 
 BUFFALO -- Jack Hughes, the projected No. 1 pick in the 2019 NHL Draft, did not participate in the fitness testing at the 2019 NHL Scouting Combine on Saturday after his mandatory medical exam three days earlier showed he was less than 100 percent. 
 The center played seven games for the United States at the 2019 IIHF World Under-18 Championship in April and seven games at the 2019 IIHF World Championship in May. The United States was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the World Championship on May 23 and Hughes arrived in Buffalo four days later. 
 ""I think I knew coming into the combine I wasn't going to do the testing because I really haven't trained for it, playing hockey the past two months,"" Hughes said. ""I really haven't had a break. It just didn't make sense to do the testing. My body needed a bit of a break. 
 ""That said, I'm a competitive kid and I felt like I could have done well in some of this stuff."" 
  
 [RELATED:  Draft Diary: Jack Hughes |  Complete NHL Draft coverage ] 
  
 A specific injury was not disclosed. The tests include a standing long jump, vertical jumps, pull-ups, bench press, grip strength, shuttle run, and stationary bicycles. Body-fat percentage and wingspan are measured. 
 Hughes led the USA Hockey National Team Development Program Under-18 team with 112 points (34 goals, 78 assists) in 50 games this season. He holds NTDP career records for assists (154) and points (228) in 110 games over two seasons. 
 He was one of 17 players from the National Team Development Program invited to the combine and was interviewed by 10 NHL teams this week, including the New Jersey Devils, who hold the No. 1 pick in the 2019 draft after winning the NHL Draft Lottery. The New York Rangers have the No. 2 pick and Chicago Blackhawks have the No. 3 pick. 
 ""The interviews are tough because you have to refocus every time,"" Hughes said. ""Obviously, the Devils and the Rangers were the most important interviews for me. I felt like both of those went good and I was comfortable with both of them."" 
 Video: Hughes on catching up with peers at Scouting Combine 
 The 18-year-old will join four 2019 draft prospects in St. Louis for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final between the St. Louis Blues and Boston Bruins on Monday: defenseman Bowen Byram (No. 2 in NHL Central Scouting's final list of North American skaters) of Vancouver in the Western Hockey League, and forwards Kirby Dach (No. 3) of Saskatoon (WHL), Alex Turcotte (No. 4) of the NTDP, and Dylan Cozens (No. 5) of Lethbridge (WHL). 
 The 2019 NHL Draft will be held at Rogers Arena in Vancouver on June 21-22. 
 ""I think it's so crazy how the draft is built up for one day and then once that day comes you're almost forgotten and it's on to the next group,"" Hughes said. ""I'm really excited to see where I go in the draft, and it'll be an awesome day for me and my family.""",1

 Mayor London Breed revealed her budget priorities for the next two years, with emphasis on homlessness and housing. 
 Mayor London Breed’s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year will soar by $1.2 billion — making it the largest in city history — and boost investment in tackling the city’s most urgent problems: housing and homelessness. 
 The mayor’s  $12.3 billion budget would  be a 10.8% increase from last fiscal year, which came in at $11.1 billion. Much of the extra money, city officials said, came from $142.3 million in excess cash in a county education fund and “better than expected” property-transfer and business taxes. 
 But that doesn’t mean the city has $12.3 billion to freely spend — about half must go to so-called enterprise departments, such as the airport, Public Utilities Commission and Municipal Transportation Agency. Another portion must meet other specific needs, such as public libraries and parks, due to voter-approved mandates. And the city will be paying more salaries. The budget covers 31,830 full-time equivalent positions, up 0.8% from the previous year. 
 That leaves the mayor and the Board of Supervisors with $3.3 billion in the general fund to decide how to spend. 
 Breed announced her budget proposal Friday at the Sunnydale public housing project near Visitacion Valley after touring some of the dilapidated public housing units that are due to be replaced. In addition to replacing the units, the city plans to add nearly 1,000 affordable and market-rate homes to the site. 
 After visiting two apartments on Santos Street, where she chatted with residents, Breed proceeded to a nearby basketball court where nearly 400 people gathered to hear her budget priorities. She said the spending plan focuses on equity and accountability for all, including people in often overlooked communities like Sunnydale. 
 “Let us remember, our job is to be accountable to everyone in this city and not just the people who can show up and advocate at City Hall,” she said. 
 Board of Supervisors President Norman Yee, who joined Breed on her Friday tour, said he expected to quibble over details but agreed with the mayor’s spending priorities. 
 “I feel we’re in sync on what we see as the broad needs,” he said, citing homelessness, affordable housing and income inequality. “My role as a member of the board is to ask questions.” 
 Breed’s proposal next heads to the board’s two-month review, led by Budget Committee Chairwoman Sandra Lee Fewer. The board is expected to  propose changes during that process. The budget must be completed and signed by the mayor no later than Aug. 1. 
 The mayor’s proposal includes funding for two years, fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21. The second year’s projected budget is expected to drop slightly to $11.9 billion because: some one-time capital project expenditures will end; and the amount of excess cash from the county education fund will shrink. The Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund, a state program, shifts a portion of local property taxes to public school systems in each county. When officials determine it has enough money to meet the minimum state funding for public schools and community colleges, the excess funds are turned over to local governments.

 But the rosy budget doesn’t reflect some challenges. In January, the mayor and controller said the city was facing a projected $270.8 million deficit over two years. In March, that was revised down to $156 million. Rising employee costs, voter-approved set-asides and  state-mandated policy changes are expected to increase expenses in the coming years. Officials in the mayor’s office say they’ve got a handle on that, however, due to slightly better than expected revenues, efforts by departments to rein in spending and increases in state funding for in-home support services. 
 But Breed, for now, is focused on how to spend the extra funds in the upcoming budget. Here’s where she’d like some  increased spending: 
 Homelessness: A major chunk of Breed’s proposal — over $100 million in additional funding  — would increase and support homeless services over two years, helping Breed meet her campaign goal of 1,000 new shelter beds by 2020. 
 Affordable housing: Breed proposes over $118 million to buy land and build 100% affordable housing, and another $10.5 million to fund a five-year, rent subsidy program for 350 low-income households and seniors struggling to pay rent. 
 “It’s all about housing,” Breed said at the Sunnydale event. “We all know the cost of housing is too high. We all know the problem did not happen overnight and will not be solved overnight.” 
 Mental health services: Another $50 million would help expand the city’s behavioral health system, which includes more than 100 treatment and recovery beds for those suffering from mental illness and substance abuse. 
 “Combined with the 100 beds we already announced earlier this year, that means we are committing 200 new beds for our most vulnerable residents this year alone,” Breed said. “That is the most significant expansion of behavioral health beds in a generation.” 
 Equity programs: The mayor also plans to increase investments in equity programs that would benefit children and young people. That includes a $15 million annual commitment for Free City College and $10 million for teacher stipends to keep educators at schools that typically have high turnover. 
 Transportation, small business and street cleaning: Breed’s  investments  include $30 million for transit, such as purchasing new light-rail trains and upgrading the train control system, $9 million for city programs that help small businesses , and $11.9 million over two years to fund seven new public toilets, Bigbelly trash cans and street cleaning.

 A Brad Crouch goal gave the Crows the lead for the first time at the 25-minute mark of the final term, and they would not give it up as the Dees could only manage 1.8 in the final quarter, including missed shots on goal from directly in front by Tim Smith, Max Gawn and Weideman who fluffed it with seconds left on the clock. 
 The undermanned Demons were on top for most of the night despite missing almost half of their best 22, with the likes of Jake Lever, Steven May, Jake Melksham and Neville Jetta still absent.

 Melbourne were able to transfer play with ease, cut through Adelaide’s defence at will and apply effective forward pressure in what was a rare display from them this year. 
 However, Adelaide overcame the huge loss of Rory Sloane, who injured his right hamstring early in the second quarter and took no further part in the game, to score a memorable comeback victory a week after coughing up a six-goal lead to West Coast. 
 Adelaide head of football Brett Burton described Sloane’s injury as a “minor tweak”. 
 HANNAN HOWLER 
 Mitch Hannan’s set shot from the boundary line in the third quarter might go down as the worst of 2019. In his attempt to screw it around with a snap shot, he somehow managed to kick it 35 metres the wrong way. Luckily for him Nathan Jones mopped up his mess moments later with a lovely goal from 50m out directly in front. 
 MIXED BAG FOR UNDER-PUMP CROWS 
 Bryce Gibbs returned to the Adelaide line-up after being dropped for the second time this year and after a modest first half, the former Blue was given the task of tagging Clayton Oliver, who had 23 touches to half-time, and greatly restricted his output. Josh Jenkins also returned after a SANFL stint and while he wasn’t in career-best form, he was far from his team’s worst with two important goals. However, their co-captain Taylor Walker once again struggled to have a meaningful impact which was especially disappointing given fellow leader Sloane was off the ground for an extended period, although he did manage to kick his 400th career goal.

 A drawing shows what the future downtown boutique hotel will look like,   [  +   -  ] 
 Video 
 FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) - In a true community-style groundbreaking ceremony, the construction of a downtown boutique hotel was celebrated Friday. 
 ""It's been my dream forever... to make the city better."" 
 Friday was Barb Baekaard's day.  After three years of talk, work officially started on her dream hotel in the heart of Fort Wayne. 
 ""It's great,"" Baekaard said. ""I love it. I love the people."" 
 It has taken conversations with leaders from the city, county and state levels for use of the land, tax credits and everything in between. 
 ""These aren't strangers on a project,"" she explained. ""These are all people that really have their heart in it. so, I love them all."" 
 ""Truly the community here, I can't say it enough, we're sort of tainted by the coasts, where people couldn't make the time for you. Look at this groundbreaking and the amount of people who came out,"" Bashar Wali, the president of Provenance Hotels said. ""It's truly special."" 
 When it's done, the hotel will stand five stories tall, with 124 rooms, retail space down along the street and a bar up on the roof. It's a design that's promised to have the feel of the Summit City, instead of the look of a chain hotel. Coined at the groundbreaking as 'the living room of Fort Wayne,' the design is inspired by Baekaard's own home. She gave WANE 15's Alyssa Ivanson a tour. You can see that here: https://www.wane.com/news/local-news/exclusive-inside-barbara-baekgaard-s-design-philosophy/2041766276 
 ""People talk a lot about story telling,"" Wali added. ""What a way to tell a story is to building something for the community of the community from the community, rather than throwing another flag in the ground from a big company."" 
 Baekgaard hopes to open late next year. Her eyes are on 10/10/2020. She also hopes it will serve as another tribute to her mother. 
 ""Her maiden name was Fox,"" she explained. ""Vera Fox Bradley. I want some variation of Fox. The Fox on Main is my first choice.""",1

73708,"German insurer in £820m UK takeovers: Double bid hands Allianz 12m British customers 
 comments 
 Allianz will become the second biggest insurer in Britain after an £820million double swoop. 
 In a vote of confidence in the UK ahead of Brexit, the Munich-based insurance company is taking control of Legal & General and LV='s general insurance arms. 
 It will pay £242million for the L&G business and as much as £578million for the 51 per cent of the LV= general insurance operation it does not already own. 
 In a vote of confidence in the UK ahead of Brexit,  Munich-based insurance company Allianz is taking control of Legal & General and LV='s general insurance arms 
 The raid will leave Allianz with 12m general insurance customers in the UK, a 9 per cent slice of the market and a business with revenues of more than £4billion a year. 
 Only British group Aviva has more clout in the UK.

 General insurance includes a range of policies such as home, car and travel cover. 
 While reduced competition may lead to less choice for customers – and higher premiums – analysts said it would, in fact, spell bad news for rival insurers as Allianz uses its might to win new business amid a fierce price war in the industry. 
 UBS analyst Jonny Urwin said the move was 'bad news' for non-life insurers, adding: 'We believe this is the last thing UK insurers needed, in a fiercely competitive market, with particular pressure on UK motor insurance margins.' 
 Niran Peiris, Allianz's head of global insurance lines, said that with these two deals, they were 'pleased to demonstrate our further commitment to the UK market'. 
 Founded in Berlin in 1890, Allianz rapidly expanded beyond Germany. It opened a London office in 1893, and became Europe's largest insurer for the first time in 1973. 
 It agreed a joint venture with LV= owner Liverpool Victoria Friendly Society in 2017, giving it a 49 per cent share of the general insurance business operating under the LV= brand. 
 Allianz is now merging the L&G and LV= businesses. That means any customers who hold policies such as home, contents or pet insurance through L&G will see the branding change to LV= at some point over the next three years. 
 Allianz will continue to use the LV= brand until at least 2026. 
 Liverpool Victoria will still use the LV= brand itself as it focuses on life insurance and pensions. L&G's remaining insurance business will concentrate solely on life and critical illness protection. 
 Allianz will take on 800 employees from L&G and 3,500 from LV=, adding them to its 4,000-strong workforce in the UK. 
 Jon Dye, the boss of Allianz's UK arm, refused to rule out job cuts but added: 'These businesses are complementary, so it's certainly not a deal which is predicated on large numbers of job cuts.' 
 A number of insurers in the UK have already been complaining about increased competition and price wars squeezing their profitability. 
 Saga's shares are down 60 per cent since its profit warning in April, and Hastings has fallen 18 per cent since it noted increased competition in a late-April trading update. 
 City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority has added to the sector's jitters after launching an inquiry into insurance pricing practices, as it worries that existing customers are being charged far more than new ones. 
 L&G's shares fell 1.3 per cent, or 3.4p, to 256.6p. Allianz – listed on the German stock exchange – dipped 1.3 per cent, or €2.6, to €198.65.

 Bruce Hits 300th HR to Help Mariners Beat Angels 4-3 
 By The Associated Press 
 June 1, 2019 
 SEATTLE — Jay Bruce has accomplished a lot in 10 seasons in the major leagues. On Friday night, he experienced his own beer shower for the first time. 
 Bruce hit his 300th career home run to join a fairly exclusive group, Tom Murphy hit a two-run shot, and the Seattle Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels 4-3. 
 ""You know, a personal beer shower, that's probably my first one,"" Bruce said. ""It's good. Cold — it's very cold. If you had told me I was going to hit my 300th home run playing first base for the Seattle Mariners, I probably would have called you crazy."" 
 Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce, who was an outfielder for much of his career, became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles (he's got 301), achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a root canal) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. 
 The win snapped the Angels' three-game winning streak and wasted a fairly strong start by Tyler Skaggs (4-5), who struck out eight and gave up just five hits but made a handful of costly mistakes while giving up four runs in seven innings. 
 Skaggs' first mistake came a few pitches after Murphy doubled off the top of the wall in the third inning for the Mariners' first hit. Home plate umpire Lance Barksdale called a balk on Skaggs and sent Murphy to third. He easily scored on Dylan Moore's single for a 1-0 lead. 
 Skaggs messed up again in the fifth when he walked Bruce with two outs. Murphy then homered to right field for a 3-0 lead. 
 ""It's extremely frustrating,"" Skaggs said. ""I thought I was really, really good and the results didn't show up. But at the same time, a lot of positives today. I really, really felt like it was the best I looked this year and (I want to) keep it rolling into the next one."" 
 The Angels briefly got to Mike Leake (4-6) in the sixth inning when Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani hit back-to-back home runs to left field with two outs. It was the first time Los Angeles has hit consecutive home runs this season, but it wasn't enough for the Angels. 
 Leake was otherwise flawless. He retired 14 of the first 15 batters he faced, didn't issue a walk against two strikeouts and scattered five hits in seven innings. He didn't allow a base runner other than Trout and Ohtani past first base. 
 Servais thought it was Leake's best game in quite some time. 
 ""Mike's a feel guy and he was feeling the breaking ball all night,"" he said. 
 The Mariners' bullpen again struggled after Leake left. Reliever Austin Adams walked two players after starting the eighth with a popout. Servais went to Jesse Biddle, who allowed Ohtani to single in a run to cut the lead to 4-3. Biddle followed by walking Kole Calhoun to load the bases. Anthony Bass came on and induced a fly ball to end the threat and pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to earn his first save. He's one of seven Seattle relievers with at least one save this season. 
 The Mariners, league leaders in errors, also got pristine defense with Murphy picking off a runner and Mitch Haniger making a diving catch in right field in the seventh, and Kyle Seager snatching up a slow roller barehanded in the ninth with a snap throw. Bass finished off the game with a strikeout. 
 ""Bass really picked us up tonight,"" Servais said. ""He hasn't been with the ballclub very long but I like what he does. He doesn't' give in."" 
 BRUCE'S BALL 
 Bruce hopes to get his home run ball back from the fan who caught it Friday night. He managed to track down home runs No. 100 and No. 200 after he hit them as well. 
 ""Honestly, I couldn't tell you where those are right now, but they're in my house,"" Bruce joked. 
 MOUND MOVES 
 Angels: Reliever John Curtiss was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake City and RHP Jake Jewell was optioned to make room a day after he pitched 2 2/3 innings of scoreless relief against the Mariners. The team also designated RHP Matt Ramsey for assignment. Ausmus would not confirm that minor leaguer Jose Suarez will start Sunday's game in Seattle in place of regular starter Trevor Cahill, who will be pushed back a day. 
 Mariners: Servais sat down with LHP Yusei Kikuchi on Friday, a day after his second straight difficult start. The two talked over how the Japanese rookie felt and how he might be used going forward. Kikuchi could make another abbreviated start of one inning next week or he could be pulled for one spin of the rotation. That decision will probably come Saturday. 
 Seattle continued to tinker with its bullpen Friday, recalling RHP Chasen Bradford from Triple-A Tacoma. He's had 10 major league relief appearances this season with one save and one hold. The Mariners optioned David McKay back to Tacoma to make room. 
 UP NEXT 
 Angels: LHP Andrew Heaney (0-0, 3.60 ERA) will make his second start of the season and first on the road after returning from elbow inflammation. 
 Mariners: LHP Tommy Milone (1-1, 3.38 ERA) tries for his second consecutive win after striking out seven and allowing four hits in a 6-2 win over Texas.

 Evers delivered the keynote address at the state party's convention Saturday night in Milwaukee. He said to expect ""spirited and robust"" primaries next year, which means more people will be out talking about issues Democrats care about. But he says the party can't let the races ""devolve into divisiveness.""

 9:25 p.m. 
 Gov. Tony Evers is boasting about his veto powers at the state Democratic Party convention. 
 Wisconsin's governor has one of the most powerful partial veto powers in the country. The tool is an important element in state budget deliberations. Evers can use it to erase or rewrite Republican proposals in the spending plan. 
 Evers addressed attendees at the convention in Milwaukee on Saturday night, saying a lot of people thought he and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes were boring during last year's campaign. 
 He said that he and Barnes said ""to hell with that."" He then bragged that he has one of the most powerful veto pens in the country and asked the crowd ""Who is boring now?"" The crowd roared, gave him a standing ovation and chanted ""Tony! Tony! Tony!""

 Liberal state Supreme Court candidates Ed Fallone and Jill Karofksy are trying to drum up votes at the Democratic Party's state convention. 
 Fallone and Karofsky are vying to unseat conservative Justice Dan Kelly in the 2020 spring elections. State Supreme Court elections are officially nonpartisan but Democrats and Republicans typically throw their support behind their favorite candidates. 
 Fallone and Karofsky spoke at the Democrats' convention Saturday in Milwaukee. Both signaled support for a host of Democratic planks during their speeches. 
 Fallone repeatedly stressed his Hispanic heritage. He said the Supreme Court should be a court for LGBT people and immigrants. 
 Karofsky said her kids benefit from public schools and her father was a pediatrician who believed everyone deserves quality health care. She added she's astonished that women's rights are under assault. She didn't elaborate but appeared to be alluding to efforts to restrict abortion rights.

 11:50 a.m. 
 Wisconsin Democrats are gathering in Milwaukee to hear Gov. Tony Evers speak at the party's state convention. 
 The convention gets underway Saturday afternoon at the Potawatomi Hotel and Casino. Evers will give the keynote address Saturday night. 
 His speech comes as Republican legislators are revising his state budget. They've already removed scores of Evers' signature proposals from the spending plan, including expanding Medicaid, legalizing medical marijuana and raising the minimum wage. 
 Also on tap to speak Saturday are U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and liberal state Supreme Court candidates Jill Karofsky and Ed Fallone. 
 They're trying to unseat conservative Justice Dan Kelly in the 2020 spring elections. The race is officially nonpartisan but Republicans back Kelly and Democrats support Karofsky and Fallone.",1

 As somebody who has shot suppressed firearms on many occasions, I can assure you the movies and this piece are wrong. Suppressed firearms may be hearing safe depending on the caliber and loadout but the gunshots are still very much audible and still very loud. 
 — Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) June 1, 2019 
 The author actually uses a good metaphor at one point. Suppressors are like car mufflers, exactly like them in fact since they're the same technology from the same inventor. A car without a muffler is much louder and potentially dangerous to your hearing. 
 — Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) June 1, 2019 
 However, a car is clearly still loud with a muffler. Gunshots are the same way but a large degree louder. I don't know how she pushes through that metaphor to get to suppressed gunfire, especially from a .45, to be the equivalent of a chair scraping on a floor. 
 — Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) June 1, 2019 
 Beyond all of that, the argument that if the evil attacker only had a non-suppressed firearm to attack defenseless people the outcome would have been better is extremely dubious. 
 — Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) June 1, 2019 
 The idea that if an attacker had access to slightly less effective weapons the outcome when pitted against defenseless people would have been less tragic is also not new. It's a common gun control argument after mass shootings and could have been articulated far better than this. 
 — Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) June 1, 2019 
 ""a suppressed gunshot can sound like a chair scraping on the floor"" 
 Huh? How do you figure? None of the ones I've heard.

 What is the probability that the author has ever heard suppressed gunfire? 
 — Robert Woolley (@RandomlyBob) June 1, 2019 
 There is no chance at all this person has ever heard suppressed gunfire. 
 — Stephen Gutowski (@StephenGutowski) June 1, 2019 
 I think that person needs to do her research. Handguns are by far the ""preferred"" weapon of choice to kill. Rifles aren't used as much, and yet, the AR-15 is the ""bad gun"". She needs to learn the truth – bad people, not firearms – kill. 
 — Sam Coco (@Sam_Coco_837) June 1, 2019 
 Hollywood has convinced people that having a suppressor equals total silence. 
 — kelly Borgman (@BorgmanKelly) June 1, 2019 
 Does this expert think a silencer makes a gunshot inaudible? Well, since she also thinks AR15 is the preferred weapon of mass shooters, she probably does 
 — Karen Y (@IAmSwell) June 1, 2019 
 She would be surprised to learn that a suppressed 45 is about as loud as a construction nail gun and can damage your hearing over time.

 Wonder when someone is going to point out that getting a suppressor requires a 4-8 month background check that costs 200 bucks and is registered with the Federal government. You Can't buy one period without a NFA background check, No loopholes or anything plus a 4-8 mo wait time.

 Schoenborn was convicted of killing his three children, aged five to 10, in a Merritt trailer home in 2008. In 2010, a judge ruled that he was not criminally responsible for their deaths because he was experiencing psychosis at the time.

 Avigdor Liberman / Getty Images 
 Five weeks after being sworn in, the 21st Knesset voted to dissolve itself. It's a first for Israeli politics; the country has never held back-to-back elections. Two freshman legislators even burst into tears. One man, Avigdor Liberman, is responsible for both the most recent April 9 elections and the new elections to be held Sept. 17. The question is why? Consensus is building that Liberman brought down the previous government (when he resigned as defense minister) and refused to join a new one in a bid to put himself back on the political map as his influence fades. 
 Liberman refused to join the government over a proposed military conscription bill for ultra-Orthodox Jews, or haredim (literally ""ones who tremble"" before God). Liberman's position—that not one clause of the bill be touched—was first viewed as merely an opening position that would soften as the weeks went by. Up to last week's Wednesday midnight deadline, there was a lingering belief that a last-minute deal would be struck. 
 But Liberman refused to budge, leaving Netanyahu one seat short of the 61 Knesset seats he needed to form a government. 
 Netanyahu, visibly furious, in a kind of verbal excommunication, announced to the press on Wednesday that Liberman was ""on the left now,"" calling him ""a serial destroyer of right-wing governments."" 
 Right-wing pundits have accused Liberman of being a fraudster—tricking his voters into believing he was right-wing when he was not. Others have painted him as irrational, or as narcissistic, reveling in his power at the expense of the entire country. Still others said he was carrying out a personal vendetta against Netanyahu. 
 But what appears to be driving Liberman is political calculation, a strategy to capitalize on Israel's religious-secular divide to reinvigorate his diminishing popularity. 
 Secular Jews fear religionization—a term voiced ever more frequently in the media. They feel that ultra-Orthodox Jews want to impose their way of life on everyone. Stoking these fears is the fact that haredim are the fastest growing segment of Israel's population. 
 Given that mandatory conscription is a rite of passage in Israel, the failure of young haredim to serve in the army is a particularly sore point. They are given deferments for religious study in yeshivas, or seminaries. It started in 1948 when Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, agreed to give deferments for 400 yeshiva students. When quotas were removed by Menachem Begin's Likud government, which needed the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel Party for its coalition, the numbers exploded, reaching well over 60,000 deferments today. 
 Ironically, some of those most critical of haredim on this score are the rank and file Orthodox who serve in the IDF and feel they are being lumped in with the haredim. Indeed, these Orthodox soldiers often go to elite units and disproportionately serve as officers, taking the place once held by kibbutz members as the crème de la crème of the IDF. 
 There have been many attempts to grapple with the problem of haredi military service over the years. Israel's Supreme Court has twice struck down laws that attempted to do so, once in 2012 and again in 2017. Actually, the conscription law, which was put forward by the Defense Ministry led by Liberman last year, doesn't seriously address the issue of ultra-Orthodox exemption as the quotas it requires are small, with a final goal of 5,737 haredi men to be inducted into the army annually after 10 years (and 1,107 into national service). 
 But it is as a symbol that the conscription law carries weight. Liberman admitted as much. ""The draft law became a symbol … but look at what is happening here,"" he said last week, pointing to haredi efforts to halt state infrastructure work on the Sabbath. 
 In retrospect, there were signs of what Liberman was planning. In the middle of the election campaign, Israel Beiteinu's slogan switched. It had been, translated loosely, ""Liberman isn't beholden to anyone."" Suddenly, it changed to ""Liberman: Also right-wing, also secular."" 
 When the mayor of Tiberias started running a ""Sabbath bus"" against the wishes of the haredi community, Liberman's party publicly supported the idea. Members of the party went to Tiberias to participate in the opening day of the new bus line. 
 The reason Liberman has latched onto this issue isn't hard to find. In the 2000s, he was a fast-rising star. He established Israel Beiteinu in 1999 and won four seats. In 2006, his party enjoyed a jump to 11 seats, and in 2009 reached a high of 15 seats. Liberman was only 51; he had held important government positions; and likely began to see himself as a potential prime minister. But in 2013, his star began to fade. In 2015, his party won six votes. In April of this year, it was down to five. And that was an achievement, given that many polls had predicted his party wouldn't even pass the electoral threshold. 
 Will Liberman's strategy work? Netanyahu called a Thursday press conference where he pointed out that Liberman didn't say a word about the conscription law when he joined his government in 2016. (Though Netanyahu didn't mention it, in Israel Beiteinu's party platform of 2013 and 2015 there is barely a mention of the issue of ultra-Orthodox recruitment.) 
 ""This man, out of personal caprice, from personal ambition, changing principles—this man is prepared to take an entire country and to throw it into the whirlpool of elections, to enter us into unnecessary elections, expensive and wasteful. For one reason, to get out [of his situation], a shrinking electorate. He needs something new,"" Netanyahu said at the press conference. 
 But while it's clear that the knives will be out for Liberman as Netanyahu tries to erase him from the political map, the first two polls following the coalition's crackup, by Israel's broadcasting authority and Channel 13, show him winning eight and nine seats respectively. 
 It's a long, long way from June to September and Israel's polls have missed before. Only on Sept. 17 will we know if Liberman's brinkmanship paid off. 
 No one is yet talking about the real danger. The religious-secular divide is a genuine one. It goes well beyond haredi enlistment to the nature of the Jewish state—with one side arguing it should be suffused with Jewish religious content and one side, well, not. One wants a Third Temple, the other, Denmark on the Mediterranean. A politician on the left, Yair Lapid, has already built a party out of attacking the religious. The worry is that Liberman, a better politician, as proven by his ability to play well with weak hands, might be more successful. He throws open a Pandora's box. The problem will be closing it.

28779,"MLB roundup: Brewers’ Arcia homers twice in win over Pirates 
 Reuters 
 Published: just now 
 Orlando Arcia hit his second two-run homer of the game in the 13th inning to give the visiting Milwaukee Brewers a 12-10 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday. 
 After Hernan Perez's two-out double, Arcia homered to center against Alex McRae (0-1). Adrian Houser (1-1) pitched the final two innings for his first major league win. 
 Starling Marte hit a three-run homer in the eighth to give Pittsburgh a 10-8 lead, but Keston Hiura answered with a two-run homer in the ninth for a 10-10 tie. 
 Christian Yelich hit his 22nd homer and had an RBI triple, and Mike Moustakas hit a solo homer for the Brewers. Pittsburgh's Elias Diaz smacked a three-run double and added an RBI single, and pinch hitter Jose Osuna hit a two-run homer. 
 Indians 5, White Sox 2 
 Cleveland's Leonys Martin and Carlos Santana belted home runs to lead Cleveland to a win over host Chicago. 
 Santana hit a solo shot in the sixth, and Martin popped a two-run homer in the seventh to break open a game that was 1-1 through five innings. The long balls helped the Indians end Chicago's AL-best five-game winning streak and earned Cleveland its first victory in the four-game series after dropping the first two. 
 Chicago's Eloy Jimenez was 2-for-4 with a double, and Tim Anderson had a hit, a stolen base and a run scored. Leury Garcia and Yonder Alonso each had sacrifice flies. 
 Twins 6, Rays 2 
 Marwin Gonzalez and Byron Buxton each homered and drove in two runs and Kyle Gibson allowed only an unearned run over five innings to pick up his fourth win in five starts to lead Minnesota to a victory over Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
 It marked the 25th consecutive game that Minnesota scored three or more runs in a game, breaking the single-season franchise record set in 2006. The Twins, who set a franchise record with 56 homers in May, clubbed two to increase the major league leading total to 108 and nearly had a third when Miguel Sano doubled off the top of the right-field fence in the seventh. 
 Christian Arroyo homered and Willy Adames and Austin Meadows each had two hits for Tampa Bay. Yonny Chirinos (6-2), who pitched five no-hit innings in his previous start against Toronto on Monday, gave up four runs on nine hits and a walk over 5 1/3 innings while striking out seven to pick up the loss. 
 Giants 8, Orioles 2 
 Brandon Belt drove in four runs and Buster Posey homered as visiting San Francisco defeated Baltimore. 
 The Giants evened the score in the series after wasting a five-run first-inning lead on Friday and losing 9-6. San Francisco took the lead in the first on Saturday and never trailed. Belt had a pair of two-run hits (a single and a double), while Posey hit a solo homer, walked twice and scored three runs. 
 San Francisco starter Shaun Anderson (1-1) earned his first major league victory. He went seven innings and gave up two runs on five hits. He walked one and struck out four. Orioles starter David Hess (1-7) lost his seventh straight game. The right-hander went four-plus innings and gave up seven runs on six hits, including one home run. 
 Braves 10, Tigers 5 
 Mike Soroka's historic start to his rookie season ended, but outfielder Austin Riley's record start continued as Atlanta ended its three-game losing streak with a victory over visiting Detroit. 
 Soroka (6-1) had not allowed more than one earned run in any of his first eight starts. He pitched 6 2/3 innings and allowed four runs (three earned) on seven hits, with no walks and five strikeouts. 
 Soroka, who won his sixth consecutive decision, was trying to become the first pitcher in the live-ball era to open a season by allowing one or fewer earned runs over nine starts. Detroit starter Daniel Norris (2-4) took the loss. He allowed six runs (five earned) on six hits and one walk in 5 1/3 innings. 
 Rangers 6, Royals 2 
 Texas outfielder Joey Gallo hit a two-run home run but came out of the game in the fifth inning with tightness in his left oblique in a win over visiting Kansas City in Arlington, Texas. 
 The Rangers have won 21 of the past 26 games against the Royals, dating to July 2016. Gallo left during the middle of an at-bat, with a 3-2 count, after reaching for his side after checking his swing. The team said Gallo underwent an MRI exam after the game and was able to pass some strength tests. He hit his 17th home run of the season in the bottom of the fourth. 
 Lance Lynn (7-4) gave up two runs on six hits in 6 1/3 innings to beat the Royals for the second time in as many chances this season. He struck out seven and didn't walk a batter. Homer Bailey (4-6) lasted just 3 2/3 innings for Kansas City, running into trouble in the fourth, when the Rangers broke a scoreless tie with four runs. 
 Nationals 5, Reds 2 
 Gerardo Parra belted a three-run homer among his three hits as visiting Washington posted a victory over Cincinnati. 
 Matt Adams homered in the fourth inning and Brian Dozier also went deep to lead off the ninth as the Nationals recorded their sixth win in eight outings. 
 Former Reds pitcher Tanner Rainey (1-1) did not allow a hit and struck out three batters in 1 1/3 scoreless innings. Former Nationals pitcher Tanner Roark (4-4), who was acquired in a trade for Rainey on Dec. 13, 2018, launched his first career homer and also drove in a run with a safety squeeze bunt for Cincinnati. He was victimized by the pair of homers he allowed after surrendering just two in his previous 11 starts this season.

 Core training and the six pack mania 
 Core training and working the abs are as different as chalk and cheese. Here’s what you need to do to get the six pack right! 
 brunch Updated: Jun 01, 2019 19:06 IST

 Hindustan Times 
 A do’s and dont’s list to get the perfect six pack (Shutterstock) 
 It seems as if everybody is chasing six-pack abs even when they are supposedly doing core training! Let me make this clear that core training and working the abs is as different as chalk and cheese. Working towards a chiseled midriff requires very specific training and diet strategy. I am perennially asked about which exercises would help in losing belly fat. You can do loads of crunches but spot reduction is not possible. Let’s try to understand what we need to do to achieve abs that stand out. 
 Females with less than 15 per cent body fat will have abs that can be clearly seen         (         Shutterstock         ) 
 The Rectus Abdominus or the abs is a thick sheaf of muscle, which runs vertically from the sternum to the pubis. When a person has sufficiently low percentage of body fat, about 10 per cent for men and 15 per cent for women, the abs can be clearly seen. If a trainee has been working the abs properly, such that they have hypertrophied plus they have low body fat, then the six pack appears! 
 When the percentage of body fat in men is lower than 10 per cent, the six pack is visible         (         Shutterstock         ) 
 I mentioned the body fat percentages first because unless you have diligently worked on your diet and reduced body fat, it’s pointless doing crunch after crunch. It is very clear that you cannot out-train a bad diet. Also, getting into the single-digit body fat percentage is not fun as it entails making substantial lifestyle changes. Most people fail at it and thus the perennial search for the six-pack. 
 Without the right diet and reduced body fat, it’s pointless to do crunch after crunch         (         Shutterstock         ) 
 What not to do if you are looking for a six pack 
 •Focus on doing endless abdominal exercises. 
 •Cheat on your diet. 
 •Try to burn belly fat by doing lots of cardio. 
 •Fall for snake oil-pushing salesmen, offering untested, unknown products for reducing body fat. 
 •Resorting to “fat burners”, available by the dozen at supplement shops. Most of these supplements do not list their full ingredients, hiding behind phrases like “proprietorial blend of natural ingredients”. 
 How to get to six pack abs 
 I would like to divide this section into two parts. Let’s focus on the diet part first. If you are dead serious about getting lean, then my recommendation is consult a good, experienced nutritionist. The nutritionist will help you modify your diet scientifically without causing any health issues. Basically, you need to get into a calorie deficit to lose body fat. This can be done by cutting calories or shifting to a Ketogenic diet or a mix of the two. Whatever might be the chosen route, my only recommendation is not to cut protein, otherwise training in the gym gets poor results. 
 Now for the training: 
 •Abs are like any other muscle. You don’t need to do thousands of repetitions six days a week. They need to be trained with progressive overload about twice a week, keeping the reps in the 12-15 range. 
 •Weighted crunches, ab pull-downs on a pulley machine, hanging leg raises are the main exercises for overloading the abs. 
 Weighted crunches, ab pull-downs on a pulley machine, hanging leg raises are the main exercises for overloading the abs         (         Shutterstock         ) 
 •Progressively overloading the abs will make them hypertrophy, just like your biceps. So when you are lean enough, the abs will stick out. 
 So there are you are – get lean and hit your abs hard. Now you can go bare torso anytime, anywhere!

They placed the ad telling him it'd be fine, then used the floppy disk he later sent in to trace him back to his church, where he used the floppy to print out documents he'd saved on it.

 I think it's part of the game. We went through this same roller coaster with Scottie Lewis. Some thought Scottie would go to UK and Cal recruited him until the end, but Scottie said that his decision was never in question. As a result, Scottie got free publicity and he's more known. There's zero downside to letting it play out almost like theatrics. I'm optimistic this ends well.",1

 Supreme Court candidates appeal to Democrats at convention 
 By TODD RICHMOND Associated Press 
 Jun 1, 2019 
 Save 
 MILWAUKEE (AP) — A pair of liberal state Supreme Court candidates worked Saturday to lock down votes at the state Democratic Party's annual convention, calling for a fair judicial system while signaling they support a range of party values. 
 Ed Fallone and Jill Karofsky are vying to unseat conservative Justice Dan Kelly in the 2020 spring elections. Wisconsin Supreme Court elections are officially nonpartisan but Democrats and Republicans typically throw their support behind their favorite candidates, turning the races into political fights that can become as intense as the race for governor or attorney general and raise questions about the candidates' impartiality. 
 Liberal Supreme Court candidates Rebecca Dallet and Tim Burns appeared at the 2017 Democratic convention. Last month Justice-elect Brian Hagedorn spoke at the state Republican convention in Oshkosh, thanking attendees for electing him and ensuring conservative justices maintain majority control of the court. 
 Fallone, a Marquette University law professor, and Karofsky, a Dane County judge, appeared at the Democratic convention on Saturday regardless. They both tried to walk a fine line between appealing to the party faithful without looking overtly partisan. 
 Fallone began his speech by attacking Kelly, noting that former Republican Gov. Scott Walker appointed him to the high court. 
 ""A spot on our state Supreme Court should not be a reward for political loyalty,"" he said. 
 Fallone repeatedly stressed his Hispanic heritage, saying he'd be the first Hispanic justice on the state Supreme Court. He promised to be a voice for working families and said the high court needs be a court for LGBT people, teachers and immigrants. 
 He said the criminal justice system locks up too many minorities and criticized judicial candidates who campaign by promising to be tough on crime, saying they contribute to a misconception that locking people up is the only way to keep communities safe. 
 He added that women's rights are human rights, an apparent allusion to efforts to restrict abortion rights. He tried to say more but convention organizers killed his microphone because he had exceeded his time limit. 
 Karofsky began her speech by lamenting how politicized the legal and judiciary systems have become. 
 ""We shake our heads at politicians in (Washington) D.C. and Madison,"" she said. ""They cut corners, undermine norms to get their way. It is time for us to restore a sense of justice and a sense of honor to our courts."" 
 She then hit on a number of Democratic planks, albeit indirectly. She said her children benefit from public schools and judges must uphold laws that protect the environment as well as protect civil rights for everyone. 
 She added that she was astonished that ""our fundamental rights as women are under assault."" She didn't say specifically which rights but like Fallone she appeared to be alluding to abortion restrictions. 
 She was talking about how she worked as director of the state Justice Department's Office of Crime Victim Services when she hit her time limit and convention organizers killed her microphone.

 ATLANTA (AP) — Natasha Howard had 19 points and 14 rebounds, Jordin Canada added 12 points and eight assists, and the Seattle Storm beat the Atlanta Dream 82-66 on Friday night. 
 Alysha Clark had 11 points and Mercedes Russell and Jewell Loyd each scored 10 for Seattle. The defending WNBA champion Storm continue to be without reigning MVP Breanna Stewart (out for the season due to an Achilles injury), 11-time all-star Sue Bird (out indefinitely after arthroscopic surgery Thursday on her right knee) and head coach Dan Hughes (on medical leave after having a cancerous tumor removed from his digestive tract on May 14). 
 Howard hit two free throws before Canada scored back-to-back baskets to spark a 16-4 run that gave Seattle a 25-12 lead with six minutes left in the second quarter and the Dream (1-1) trailed by double figures the rest of the way. 
 Brittney Sykes led Atlanta with 12 points. The Dream shot just 32.9 percent (24 of 73) from the field, including 6 of 23 (26.1 percent) from 3-point range. 
 The Storm had 23 assists and 30 made field goals.

 Howard, Seattle Storm overpower Atlanta Dream

 Natasha Howard racked up 19 points, 14 rebounds, four assists and three blocked shots, and the visiting Seattle Storm rolled to an 82-66 win over the Atlanta Dream on Friday. 
 Jordin Canada had 12 points and eight assists, and Alysha Clark added 11 points for Seattle (2-1). Mercedes Russell and Jewell Loyd chipped in 10 apiece. 
 Brittney Sykes led the Dream (1-1) with 12 points but went scoreless in the second half. Tiffany Hayes and Monique Billings tossed in nine points apiece for Atlanta. 
 The defending champion Storm bounced back from a double-digit defeat at Minnesota on Wednesday. Seattle is playing without last year's league Most Valuable Player, Breanna Stewart (Achilles tear) and longtime point guard Sue Bird (knee surgery). 
 The Dream are still awaiting the season debut of top player Angel McCoughtry (knee surgery). 
 The Storm finished the first quarter on a 9-2 run to take an 18-10 lead. Canada made a couple of baskets and Clark knocked down a three during that span. 
 The lead expanded in the second quarter as the Storm were up 45-27 at halftime. A Shavonte Zellous layup made it 25-12. Loyd hit a 3-pointer with 3:20 remaining in the half for an 18-point advantage, and two Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis free throws upped the lead to 20. 
 Howard had 13 points and seven rebounds by the break, while Sykes' teammates were 6-for-29 from the field in the first half. 
 The Dream cut the deficit to 11 during the first five minutes of the second half. However, Seattle came right back with a 10-2 run, capped by a Clark 3-pointer. Atlanta got the deficit down to 61-47 by the end of the quarter. 
 Zellous made two field goals early in the fourth to push Seattle's lead to 20 once again.

 227 years ago in 1792, the Commonwealth of Kentucky became the 15th state in the union. 
 One might argue it is the greatest state in the union, but arguing is no way to celebrate a birthday. Instead, I’ve compiled a list of 27 destinations to see across the Bluegrass that will help you appreciate everything our wonderful state has to offer. 
 1. Churchill Downs — The iconic Twin Spires look over the home of the Kentucky Derby. Whether it’s Derby week, Downs after Dark or Thursday dollar beers, you can’t go wrong. 
 2. Keeneland — Where Churchill is the track in the middle of the city, Keeneland lies in the heart of Bluegrass horse country. The only racecourse where you can walk through the horse barns, if you take the scenic route down Old Frankfort Pike, you will see sights made for postcards. 
 3. Gray’s Arch — The 3.4-mile loop through Red River Gorge provides one of the most rewarding views of the area. A little more hidden than the Natural Bridge, it’s worth going off the beaten path to see this beauty. 
 4. Miguel’s Pizza — After your hike through the gorge, you need to refuel. Miguel is here to help. 
 5. Chain Rock — Ecology at its best, this rock that sits atop Pine Mountain is attached to enormous chain links. The chain was forged to prevent the rock from falling onto the town of Pineville (but was the rock really going to fall?). 
 6. Mammoth Cave — The state’s only National Park is the longest cave system known in the world. 
 7. The Corvette Museum — Kentuckians make the coolest American cars on the planet, no big deal. 
 8. The Louisville Slugger Museum — And we create the best baseball bats too. 
 9. Maker’s Mark Distillery — I could live without baseball bats and sports cars, but not bourbon. You can’t go wrong at any of the many distilleries throughout the state, but few are as beautiful as Maker’s Mark. Snuggled in between the Loretto, Kentucky hills, the smell of the sour mash and the sound of birds chirping makes this place feel like home. 
 10. Lake Cumberland — Unlike many of the manmade lakes around the state, Lake Cumberland has a rocky bottom that makes the green water clear. You can skip rocks on the shore, jump off a cliff or float in paradise. 
 11. Cumberland Falls — Before the river turns into a reservoir, there’s a 68-foot waterfall not far from Corbin, Kentucky. It’s the only waterfall in the Western Hemisphere where a Moonbow is regularly visible. The only other one in the world is Africa’s Victoria Falls. You can see the lunar rainbow coming off the falls during a full moon. Here’s when you can see it again this year.

 12. Kentucky Fried Chicken — Before you check out the Moonbow, you can grab a bucket of the Colonel’s Original Recipe from the original location in Corbin. 
 13. Cumberland Gap — While I’m mentioning the Cumberlands, might as well throw this one in there. Even if you aren’t a kid, it’s kind of cool to stand in three states at once. 
 14. Newport on the Levee — With views of the Cincinnati skyline, the northern Kentucky Levee has excellent food and drink options near one of the best aquariums in the region. 
 15. The Big Four Bridge — Developed into a walking bridge in 2014, the recreational area is settled in-between Louisville Slugger Field and the new Louisville City FC Stadium. Of all the nice areas in Louisville’s Waterfront Park, this one is the best. 
 16. Muhammad Ali Center — Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, this center dedicated to the World’s Greatest is something you have to see. 
 17. Dinosaur World — Jurrasic Park ain’t got nothing on this Western Kentucky landmark. 
 18. Wigwam Village — Can you think of a better place to stay the night in Western Kentucky? I think not. (If you don’t enjoy your stay, blame this recommendation all on Coach Keith Madison.) 
 19. Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill — Turn back in time by visiting the country’s largest collection of 19th century buildings. 
 20. Boon Tavern — The Berea, Kentucky landmark is the only place you can enjoy world famous Spoon Bread. 
 21. Moonlite Bar-B-Q Inn — Some will argue which Owensboro locale has the best mutton BBQ, but Moonlite has earned the “world famous” distinction. The flavor of Owensboro BBQ is unrivaled. You can’t find it anywhere else. And now my mouth is watering. 
 22. KSBar — While I’m shouting out restaurants, go to ours. Trust me, the wings are excellent. 
 23. Abraham Lincoln’s Birthplace — Illinois likes to take credit for molding Lincoln into the man who led the Union through the Civil War, but it all got started in Hodgenville. 
 24. Iroquois Park Amphitheater — In the heart of Louisville’s largest Olmsted Park (the same Olmsted that designed New York City’s Central Park), the 2,300-seat amphitheater is one of region’s best outdoor music venues. Even if you don’t attend a concert, they host free movie nights, the Jack O’Lantern Spectacular and much more . 
 25. The Louisville Palace — The classic architecture is stunning. It is difficult to describe the interior, so I’ll just say this: the Palace is the kind of place you see in a movie in a big city. We are lucky to have such an incredible environment for performances in the Commonwealth. 
 26. Land Between the Lakes — The largest inland peninsula in the United States, the National Recreational Area in Western Kentucky is surrounded by Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley. If you love the outdoors, you can do pretty much anything, even see elk and bison, at Land Between the Lakes. 
 27. My Old Kentucky Home — Birthdays are best celebrated at home.",1
70756,"He, therefore, concluded it was ""about time"" the Government released to the public all the documents relating to the preparation that has been done for the eventuality of a no deal. 
 He said: “Dominic doesn’t prefer a no deal Brexit, he wants a deal. 
 “But he recognises that he has to retain the option of no deal for both negotiating purposes and fallback purposes. 
 “And he and I and everybody else who served in DexEU and in the relevant department know that we can do a deal which does not involve a hard border. 
 “Indeed, it is our determination under all circumstances, deal or no deal, to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland.

 It’s about time the Government put that work out in the public domain so we can all see it 
 David Davis 
 “That’s the fundamental premise you have to remember. It can be done, the work’s been done behind it. 
 “It’s about time the Government put that work out in the public domain so we can all see it.” 
 Dominic Raab resigned as Brexit Secretary in November 2018 over his dissent with the withdrawal agreement Theresa May struck with the European Union last year. 
 Mr Raab, who is now running to succeed Mrs May at Number 10 after she announced her resignation, suggested the British Government could have signed up to a better deal with Brussels had he been ""backed up"" during his stint on the frontbench. 
 Speaking to ITV News earlier this week, Mr Raab said: ""There were various moments between July and October where I made it clear we needed to stick to more robust lines on the backstop both in our dealings with the Irish Government but also Brussels. 
 ""Had I been backed up then and not undermined by others in Government, we’d have a much better chance at getting a deal over the line acceptable to the UK and capable of passing through Parliament."" 
 The Prime Minister gave into demands to quit her position after failing to win support for her withdrawal agreement in the Commons three times. 
 The Washer and Walton MP also dismissed suggestions claiming Speaker of the House John Bercow could intervene to prevent a no deal Brexit scenario from happening. 
 He continued: ""Parliament should, of course, have its say right the way through this but actually I think it’s very difficult for Parliament to frustrate Brexit if the Government is serious about keeping our promises to the people of this country. 
 ""Those are promises every Conservative made in every manifesto, in every constituency across the country in 2017. I’m fundamentally someone who thinks promises must be kept in politics. 
 ""I think it’s very difficult for Parliament to stop the Government proceeding to no deal Brexit. But that’s not what I want.""

 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden declared Saturday that the Equality Act would be his top legislative priority, an effort to enshrine LGBTQ protections into the nation's labor and civil rights laws. 
 The former vice president shared his hopes of signing the legislation as part of a keynote address to hundreds of activists at the Human Rights Campaign's annual Ohio gala on the first day of Pride Month. In a half-hour at the lectern, his remarks ranged from emotional tributes to his audience and their personal endurance to condemnations of President Donald Trump. 
 ""It's wrong and it is immoral what they're doing,"" Biden said of the Trump administration. Among other Trump polices, he cited attempts to bar transgender troops in the U.S. military, allow individuals in the medical field to refuse to treat LGBTQ individuals, and allow homeless shelters to refuse transgender occupants. 
 ""Just like with racial justice and women's rights, we are seeing pushback against all the progress we've made toward equality,"" Biden said. 
 The Equality Act would address many such discriminatory practices. It recently passed the Democratic-run House, but will not become law under Trump and the Republican Senate. That means LGBTQ residents in dozens of states are still subject to various forms of discrimination that are either specifically allowed or not barred by state law. 
 ""It will be the first thing I ask to be done,"" Biden said. 
 Biden spoke in Ohio, a political battleground he was visiting for the first time since beginning his bid, on the same day that more than a dozen of his rivals were in San Francisco for the California Democratic Convention and a massive MoveOn.org conference. By the end of the weekend, 14 candidates will have addressed thousands of activists in California, which has more than 400 delegates to the 2020 convention, about a fifth of what it will take to win the nomination. 
 Among them, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, nodded to Biden's absence with subtle jabs. 
 ""Some Democrats in Washington believe the only changes we can get are tweaks and nudges. ... Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses,"" Warren said, an allusion to Biden's recent prediction that Republicans will have ""an epiphany"" once Trump leaves office. 
 Biden made no mention of his rivals, with his go-it-alone itinerary and his message signifying his burgeoning confidence at his position atop the pack of 24 presidential hopefuls. 
 Campaigning in a Midwest battleground is no surprise for Biden. One of the prevailing arguments for his candidacy is that his moderate, deal-making, ""Middle Class Joe"" brand offers Democrats their best shot to win back the industrial belt that Trump wrested from the party in 2016. 
 Yet the HRC event offered both Biden and his audience a chance to go beyond that simplified framing of the 2020 landscape. 
 ""The thing that gets overlooked when the story is written about Ohio and the Midwest is that we're incredibly diverse,"" said Shawn Copeland, HRC's Ohio director. 
 × 
 {{featured_button_text}} 
 Copeland said HRC has identified about 1.8 million ""equality voters"" in Ohio, including 400,000 LGBTQ citizens, plus their family members, friends and other allies. Trump got 2.84 million Ohio votes to Hillary Clinton's 2.4 million in 2016. 
 Biden, meanwhile, used the forum to underscore his long alliance with HRC and LGBTQ activists — a key to Biden's contention that he's more progressive than the party's left flank acknowledges. 
 The former vice president visibly enjoyed recalling the 2012 presidential campaign when he announced his support for same-sex marriage before his boss, President Barack Obama, had done so. 
 Biden recalled that most political observers ""thought I had just committed this gigantic blunder."" He said he'd let Obama know beforehand what might be coming. ""I told the president if asked, I was not going to be quiet."" 
 The rest of his remarks were less jovial, as Biden lamented the widespread discrimination that still exists in the U.S. and abroad. Noting recent killings of black transgender women, he roared: ""It's outrageous. It must, it must, it must end. The fastest way to end it is to end the Trump administration.""

 He lowered his voice as he listed the percentage of LGBTQ children and teens who attempt or consider suicide. ""I don't have to tell you how hard it is for these kids, because many of you were these kids,"" he said, ""the terror in your heart as you spoke your truth."" 
 Several Democratic hopefuls have addressed HRC state dinners this year. National officials with the organizations say they've worked with the campaigns and the state organizations to schedule the occasions. 
 A Biden campaign statement issued before the speech said the choice to go to Ohio proves Biden wants to have conversations about LGBTQ rights ""not just on the coasts of this country, but in the heartland and with any and all Americans."" 
 The venue also allowed him to push back, at least indirectly, at some of the jabs from California. He reminded the audience that he campaigned for many of the freshman House Democrats who helped the party to a net gain of 41 seats — mostly by winning swing or GOP-leaning districts. 
 ""We didn't have to be radical about anything,"" he said. ""They talked about basic, fundamental rights."" 
 With the resulting House majority, Biden noted, the Equality Act has gotten further than ever before.

40437,"UFC Stockholm: Leonardo Santos flatlines Stevie Ray in UFC return 
 Comment 
 Leonardo Santos made an emphatic return to the Octagon, landing a counter-right hand to knock Stevie Ray out in the first round. 
 Leonardo Santos defeated Stevie Ray via KO, Round 1 – 2:17 at UFC Stockholm on Saturday, June 1, 2019 live from the Ericsson Globe in Stockholm, Sweden. 
 Santos explained to Dan Hardy that he has dealt with a number of injuries as well as other commitments outside of the cage which have limited his activity. With all that behind him, he now hopes to be more active in the future. 
 “Sean Shelby, my boss Dana White, I just want to fight more times,” Santos said. “Put my name in [the] top 10.” 
 — UFC (@ufc) June 1, 2019 
 Round 1 
 The fight began with a touch of gloves. Santos took the center of the cage and struck first with a body kick. Ray feinted with his jab, but Santos tagged his body with another kick. Santos fired a third kick that landed. Ray was unable to find his range as Santos continued to land the right kick to the body of Ray. Ray landed his first strike, a low kick that landed slightly. Ray came forward feinting, but Santos maintained his distance, threatening the kick. A huge head kick attempt sent Ray down after he failed to hit his target. Ray came forward and Santos landed a right hand that put Ray to sleep before he even hit the ground. 
 Santos made a successful return to the Octagon. The 39-year-old veteran has competed sparingly over the past four years, fighting just four times since 2015, including the appearance today. 
 The Brazilian lightweight hasn’t lost in MMA since 2009. Santos has fought 12 times since the split-decision loss, winning 11 and fighting to a draw with Norman Parke in 2014. 
 Ray falls to 6-4 in the UFC with the loss. In his past three bouts leading up to this fight, he suffered a knockout loss to Paul Felder and a split-decision defeat to Kajan Johnson before turning it around and beating Jessin Ayari to put an end to the first losing streak of his career.

 HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A former Fulbright scholar who has been fighting deportation to his native Indonesia left the sanctuary of a Connecticut church Friday after 598 days. 
 Sujitno Sajuti had been living inside Meriden's Unitarian Universalist church with his wife, Dahlia, since being ordered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2017 to board a plane. 
 U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who accompanied Sajuti as he walked out the front door of the church, said federal authorities have determined that Sajuti was once a victim of a violent crime and therefore qualified for a U visa that will allow him to stay in the United States. 
 ""It is fitting that during this third and final stage of Ramadan, salvation from hell, I'm leaving from a long period of confinement and am finally free to join my community,"" Sajuti said. 
 Neither he nor Blumenthal elaborated on the crime, though Blumenthal said Hartford police provided federal officials with the evidence. 
 ""The triumph today is really a lesson from Sujitno and his family,"" said Blumenthal, a Democrat. ""Never give up. Never back down. Never give up, because the fight is worth it."" 
 Sajuti came to the United States in 1981 on a Fulbright Scholarship, earning advanced degrees from Columbia University and the University of Connecticut. The West Hartford resident overstayed his student visa and remained in the United States. 
 He has said he has registered with immigration officials since 2001. 
 Sajuti filed an appeal of the deportation order and a motion to stay the deportation last July. 
 Blumenthal said immigration authorities have granted what is known as deferred action, a decision not to remove an individual from the United States. The decision lasts indefinitely but can be reversed at any time. 
 ""Following a determination that Sajuti qualifies for a legal immigrant visa, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations does not anticipate pursuing enforcement action in this case at this time,"" the agency said in a statement. 
 The agency has a policy to not arrest people at certain ""sensitive"" locations, including churches. Several other immigrants facing deportation have taken sanctuary in churches in Connecticut. 
 Church leaders planned to accompany Sajuti to Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices to have his ankle bracelet removed. He and his wife planned to then return to their apartment in West Hartford, they said. 
 ""What an amazing victory!"" said Rev. Jan Carlsson-Bull, the church's minister, in a letter to supporters. ""This shows once again the power that working against injustice can have. Sujitno and Dahlia will be able to observe the rest of Ramadan with their own faith community.""

 WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is tweeting in support of LGBT people to mark LGBT Pride Month. 
 His tweets come one week after his administration moved to revoke newly won health care discrimination protections for transgender people. 
 That move was the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration that aim to reverse gains by LGBTQ Americans in areas including the military, housing and education. 
 In his tweets Friday, Trump says he wants to ""recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation."" 
 The president says other nations ""punish, imprison or even execute individuals on the basis of sexual orientation."" He says the U.S. has a ""global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality.""

 Indiana cracks down on destructive beavers at preserve 
 Jun 1st, 2019 - 12:51pm (EDT) 
 Updated: 
 Jun 1st, 2019 - 12:53pm (EDT) 
 MOUNT VERNON, Ind. (AP) — Wildlife officials are culling beavers and demolishing their dams in a swampland nature preserve in southwestern Indiana to protect a species of oak tree rarely found in the state. 
 Overcup oaks thrive in swamps, but beaver dams in the Twin Swamps Nature Preserve have elevated water levels so high that the trees have been damaged or killed, the Evansville Courier & Press reported . 
 Now, the state has stepped in to combat the threat at the 500-acre (200-hectare) property in Mount Vernon. 
 ""It's actually altering the very habitat the nature preserve was designed to protect,"" said Tom Swinford, the program manager at the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. ""We had to take action."" 
 The nature preserve combines two swamps — the Cypress Swamp and Overcup Oak Swamp — and is home to a variety of plants and wildlife, including the state-endangered wildflowers Spider Lilly and Indian Pink. Some plants found there, including the overcup oaks, can only be found in that far southwestern corner of the state. 
 Overcup acorns are also an important food source for many animals, Swinford said. 
 Despite the delicacy of the habitat and the apparent destruction of the beavers, Swinford said the goal isn't to eliminate the beaver population from the preserve altogether, but to reduce it. 
 Moving the beavers to a new home isn't an option.

 Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador says Mexico will not respond to U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of coercive tariffs with desperation, but instead push for dialogue, during his daily morning press conference at the National Palace, in Mexico City, Friday, May 31, 2019.

 A stock monitor shows exchange rates on a storefront in Mexico City, Mexico, Friday, May 31, 2019, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 5% tariff — that could increase incrementally to 25% — on all Mexican imports. The economic impact for Mexico was swift. The peso dropped more than 3% against the U.S. dollar by Friday morning.

 CULIACAN, Mexico (AP) — Tomato exporter Sergio Esquer Peiro spent much of Friday in hastily called meetings with other stunned growers, trying to evaluate the potential fallout of U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to slap coercive tariffs on all imports from Mexico. 
 The sudden announcement caught observers on both sides of the border by surprise and prompted President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to dispatch his top diplomat to Washington for talks seeking to head off the proposed tariffs. 
 Obrador said Mexico won't panic over the threatened hike, but economists and those whose livelihoods depend on the trade relationship worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year worry that stiff duties could have dramatic, negative consequences and potentially spark a trade war between the neighboring countries. 
 Already, Esquer and other exporters were having to contend with a 17.56% tariff on tomatoes imposed after Washington announced in March it was ending a longstanding agreement over alleged Mexican dumping of the fruit. If the new duties do take effect, Esquer is looking at another 5% being slapped on his products — potentially increasing to 25% in subsequent months — unless Mexico does more to stop illegal migration through its territory by a June 10 deadline per Trump's demand. 
 ""Right now more than anything there is a reaction of disbelief with everything that is going on,"" Esquer, who's been sending tomatoes and other crops to the United States for 60 years, told The Associated Press by phone during a break in the meetings. 
 ""It also goes against the spirit there is between both countries, the agreements we have, the bilateral trade we have, which is very successful,"" Esquer continued. ""On the other hand, we'll have to wait for the reaction of U.S. exporters to Mexico, because they are also going to see their exports threatened if Mexico launches some kind of mirror policy."" 
 From berries and automobiles to machinery and household appliances, all of Mexico's exports stand to be hit with the tariffs. Avocado growers in Michoacan, electronics factory workers in Tamaulipas, across the border from Texas, auto parts exporters, all would feel the pinch. 
 Esquer, who does business from the tomato-growing northwestern state of Sinaloa, said it's not just businessmen who stand to lose, since Mexico's estimated 700 tomato exporters are responsible for directly generating some 450,000 jobs. According to Mexico's Agriculture Department, last year some $2 billion in tomatoes were exported to the United States, second only to tequila and ahead of avocados. 
 The threat also throws into question the future of the USMCA trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, hammered out in months of contentious negotiations as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement, one of the Trump administration's most touted achievements. 
 Trump's threat came the same day Mexico announced it would begin the process of ratifying the USMCA and less than two weeks after it successfully negotiated the lifting of U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs that had been a roadblock to final approval for the trade deal. 
 ""It would really have a terrible impact on our producers and our exporters,"" said Kenneth Smith Ramos, who led then-President Enrique Peña Nieto's delegation to USMCA talks and is now an international trade consultant at Mexico City-based AGON. 
 ""And it would hurt U.S. producers as well because they rely a lot on Mexican inputs for their production,"" he added. ""So it would reduce their competitiveness and force them to raise prices, which would ultimately of course hit consumers."" 
 That means people like Chuck Sholtis, CEO of El Paso, Texas-based Plastic Molding Technology Inc., which employs 100 people. Most of its business involves plastic injection molding for automotive, electronics and business products for maquiladoras, factories in Mexico that are run by foreign companies. Sholtis said his company has already suffered from U.S. steel tariffs on China that increased the costs of their tools, and it's also been hit by slowdowns at ports of entry 
 Sholtis said the United States has found a niche in high-tech specialized manufacturing that's part of a global supply chain. He fears that if more tariffs like this are implemented, or if the USMCA doesn't take effect, the United States will lose its edge in manufacturing. He's also worried about possible recession in Mexico and the United States. 
 ""It's illogical,"" Sholtis said, ""Tariffs go against one of the stated goals of the administration: to help manufacturing and thereby create high-skilled manufacturing jobs."" 
 The economic impact for Mexico was swift, with the peso down more than 3% against the U.S. dollar Friday. U.S. stocks likewise tumbled on Wall Street. 
 Initial macroeconomic projections from economists were also chilling. 
 Analyst Alfredo Coutiño of Moody's Analytics said Mexican exports to the U.S. totaled $358 billion last year, or 80% of all goods the country sold overseas. Over the course of a year, he said, a 5% tariff would represent about $18 billion in damage or 1.5% of Mexico's GDP, while a 25% tariff would amount to $90 billion or 7.3% of GDP. 
 Banco Base estimated that a 5% tariff could knock 2.85 percentage points off growth of Mexico's exports, but said a weaker peso would help compensate. 
 Such tariffs would ""likely push Mexico into a recession,"" as well as disrupt regional supply chains and hurt investor confidence, Oxford Economics economist Gregory Daco wrote in a report. 
 Coutiño said Mexico could impose retaliatory penalties, sparking a tariff war. 
 A second, ""less aggressive but potentially more effective"" option would be to allow the peso to depreciate to the point where the tariffs would be neutralized, he added. 
 Via Twitter, Trump argued that ""Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades. Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done."" 
 Mexico already has implemented policies and actions to discourage irregular migration. 
 Last month, it raided the latest caravan of mostly Central American migrants traveling through the southern state of Chiapas, arresting hundreds and effectively breaking it up. There have been no significant caravans since then, with many migrants saying they now fear to travel in large groups. 
 Mexico also has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more with seemingly endless waits for permits that would allow them to travel legally through the country. 
 But sealing its porous southern border with Guatemala is probably impossible because Mexico lacks sufficient infrastructure to completely patrol a frontier that includes a river passing through dense jungle. 
 ""We are carrying out our responsibility in immigration policy,"" López Obrador said Friday morning, while making no promises of new action to stem the flow of mostly Central American immigrants transiting Mexico to reach the U.S. border. 
 ""We have to help so that they don't enter the United States illegally, but we also have to do it respecting human rights,"" said López Obrador. ""Nothing authoritarian. They're human beings."" 
 López Obrador espouses a longer-term, holistic approach focused on improving security, development and economic opportunity in the migrants' countries of origin, especially Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. 
 For now López Obrador is betting on diplomacy and dialogue. 
 Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard announced talks would take place next Wednesday in Washington with him and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo leading their respective nations' delegations. 
 ""There is a disposition for dialogue,"" Ebrard tweeted. ""We will be firm and we will defend the dignity of Mexico."" 
 In Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, 21-year-old Jennifer del Carmen Pérez Hernández, said she moved there three years ago because she couldn't find work in her home state of Veracruz, on the Gulf coast. 
 Pérez said when she first arrived she was told that if Trump were elected, staff cuts might be possible. She's kept her job operates an upholstery machine specialized for cars so far, but the tariff threat gives her new cause for concern. 
 ""I've worked in sewing the three years that I've been in Juarez. It's what I know,"" Pérez said. ""If there are cuts and I have to find work elsewhere, I would start at zero.""

92475,"OP-ED: Fayetteville business leaders call for support of school budget 
  
 By Hector Ray, Ralph Huff, Murray Duggins, Bill Hedgepeth, Ron Darden and John McCauley 
 Saturday 
 Jun 1, 2019 at 10:28 AM 
 Another opportunity to keep Fayetteville and Cumberland County moving forward is upon us. As we have all seen, significant investments have recently been made in our community and we are already seeing the positive economic impact. Beyond the financial returns, there is a noticeable improvement to our quality of life, making this area a dramatically better place to live, work and play. 
 We are a group of civic-minded businesspeople who are united in our desire to see this community reach its full potential. Many of us were born here but, whether we have lived here all our lives or not, we all love this county. Cumberland County’s public schools have a dynamic new superintendent and a bold, responsible budget proposal has recently been forwarded to the Cumberland County commissioners. 
 We are at a pivotal time in Cumberland County and there is an opportunity to continue our transformation by fully funding the 2019-20 Cumberland County School’s budget request. It appears to us that Dr. Connelly and the Board of Education have listened to the community and crafted a budget that reflects the best path forward for our school system to meet the needs of the whole child. Too many of our children face tremendous challenges outside of the classroom and additional resources are clearly needed to help each child reach their full potential. 
 Some argue that many of these needs are the responsibility of the state. That may be. But at the end of the day, they are our children and our grandchildren. And like any good parent, when your children have needs, you do your dead-level best to meet them. 
 Why would anyone not fully support the education of our children? We cannot think of any reason not to fully fund this budget request and endorse this administration’s forward-looking plan to continue our upward path. 
 There will always be competing demands for limited tax dollars. However, we believe that “a rising tide lifts all ships” and that by fully funding public education, a message will be sent loud and clear that we are doing right by our citizens and believe in our children. This investment in our future will raise our outcomes and, ultimately, increase our tax base. Besides, it is just the right thing to do. 
 So, we respectfully request our county commissioners to fully fund the 2019-2020 budget request presented by the Board of Education and continue the transformative investments in the economic outlook of our county.

 BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Trevor Hauver had three hits, drove in two runs and scored twice, and Arizona State staved off elimination in the NCAA tournament with a 13-5 victory over Stony Brook on Saturday. 
 Gage Workman and Sam Ferri also had three hits apiece, while Spencer Torkelson, Alika Williams and Carter Aldrete each drove in two runs to help the Sun Devils (38-18) bounce back from a lopsided loss to Southern Mississippi on Friday and stay alive in the Baton Rouge regional. 
 Arizona State starter RJ Dabovich (7-1) pitched into the seventh, allowing five runs and striking out six. 
 Stony Brook starter Bret Clarke (8-1) lost for the first time this season after giving up seven runs in 4 1/3 innings. 
 Sean Buckhout had two hits and drove in three runs for Sea Wolves (31-23), who were eliminated. 
 Buckhout's two-out, two-run single gave the Sea Wolves a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first. 
 Hauver tripled off the top of the wall in right-center and scored the Sun Devils' first run on Torkelson's double in the third. Torkelson came around to tie it on Williams' single. 
 A walk and hit batter got Clarke into more trouble in the fourth. Hauver's single drove in one and moved Drew Swift to third before he scored on a wild pitch. 
 Run scoring singles by Aldrete, Swift and Hauver drove Clarke from the game in the fifth.",1

 City officials in Dardanelle, Arkansas, are trying a ""last ditch effort"" to save the south side of the town from encroaching Arkansas River floodwater that is pouring through a breached levee. 
 Mayor Jimmy Witt said Saturday that he didn't believe a temporary levee being constructed will stop the water, but that hopes it will buy time for residents of up to 800 homes to make preparations.

 Officials say there's no way of telling how bad the flooding could get, but that some residents are already dealing with it. 
 The levee at Dardanelle, which has roughly 4,500 residents and is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) upstream from Little Rock, failed Friday when the river tore a 40-foot (12-meter) hole through it. Officials say the breach has expanded a little and the water flow has slowed a bit.

 Officials are knocking on doors in a North Little Rock, Arkansas, neighborhood and telling residents they should probably leave for higher ground due to the threat of flooding from the Arkansas River. 
 Officials say in a Facebook post Saturday that they believe the river will back up storm drainage areas and cause roads to become inaccessible for possibly more than a week. 
 City spokesman Nathan Hamilton says there are about 150 homes in the neighborhood covered by the evacuation recommendation. 
 Officials said Friday night that a nearby city levee had been breached and the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning, but it was canceled when officials later said the levee hadn't breached and wasn't in danger of failing. Instead, a containment berm at a riverside petroleum facility had breached.

 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau listens as U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence makes his opening statement during a joint news conference in Ottawa, Thursday, May 30, 2019. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld 
 China is showing its true colours and showing that now more than ever, Canada needs to stand with the United States and our other allies. 
 A day after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refused to back down on the extradition request of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, China was threatening Canada. 
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the threat after Trudeau and American Vice President Mike Pence called for the release of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. 
 Kovrig and Spavor were detained by Chinese officials on trumped-up charges after Canada detained Meng. 
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang speaks during a daily briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Beijing, Tuesday, Jan. 29, 2019. (AP Photo/Andy Wong) 
 “We hope that the Canadian side can have a clear understanding of the consequences of endangering itself for the gains of the U.S. and take immediate actions to correct its mistakes so as to spare itself the suffering from growing damage,” Geng said. 
 If you want to know what those consequences are, above and beyond Canadians being arbitrarily detained, look no further than China’s threat against the United States this week. 
 As the Americans push to squeeze Huawei out of the development of the 5G network citing security and privacy concerns, China threatened to cut off the supply of rare earth minerals. 
 EDITORIAL: China’s threats of ‘suffering’ can’t go unanswered by us 
 The minerals are used to make a wide range of high-tech materials from military gear such as advanced missiles to the smartphone you carry around everyday. 
 China has the world’s largest reserves of the minerals, more than double the supply found in the next biggest producers Brazil and Vietnam. 
 Beijing is threatening to cut off companies that comply with an American order not to do business with Huawei. 
 So how did one company become so central to a major trade and diplomatic war involving Canada, the United States, China and more? 
 Michael Kovrig (left) and Michael Spavor, the two Canadians detained in China, are shown in these 2018 images taken from video. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
 The Americans asked Canada to detain Ms. Meng on an extradition request on claims that she and her company, among other things, lied to banks about the company’s dealings with Iran in violation of U.S. trade sanctions. 
 Huawei, founded by Ms. Meng’s father, is also seen as being extremely close to the dictatorial regime in Beijing which raises the national security concerns. 
 The Americans, and many others, don’t think it would be safe or wise to have the next generation of telecommunications developed on equipment designed and built by a company so close to China’s leadership. 
 Phil Lind, vice-chairman of the board at Rogers, said this week that Huawei should be banned from the 5G network.

Wanzhou was in court prior to extradition hearings and could face criminal charges of conspiracy and fraud in the U.S. (Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images) 
 “Huawei is cheaper and quite sophisticated. But the fact is, they’re very, very close to the Chinese government. So for anyone to argue that they wouldn’t be compromised if the government said, ‘do this’ – they’d do it. They have to do it. They’re in that country,” Lind said in an interview with BNN Bloomberg. 
 For detaining this company’s CFO, two Canadians have been in prison for nearly six months. Another had his prison sentence for drug smuggling upgraded to the death penalty. Meanwhile, China is targeting Canadian products such as canola, peas and pork by blocking their export. 
 Now they are threatening the biggest companies in the world over rare earth minerals. 
 If Ms. Meng broke no laws, if she and the company are innocent then she will stand trial in the United States after being extradited by Canada and will eventually walk free. 
 That isn’t a risk the leaders in Beijing want to take. 
 So they are flexing their muscle and hoping the rest of the world will come to heel. 
 Given their lack of basic human rights, their lack of respect for the rule of law, their theft of every piece of intellectual property the country can get its hands on, this isn’t the time for Canada to buckle. 
 If we give in to China this time, then the price will be higher next time. 
 In the fight between Beijing and Washington, we need to stand tall with the Americans.",1

 The Gauchos (45-11) trailed 4-0 after four innings, but rallied to tie the score with a run in the fifth inning, two in the sixth and one in the eighth inning. Only one run came on a hit. McClain O’Connor got the Gauchos on the board with a run-scoring double. But the runs in the sixth inning came on a Marcos Castanon sacrifice fly and when Tevin Mitchell was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded. Christian Kirtley doubled in the eighth inning and came around to score on a pair of wild pitches.

 Sacramento State (40-24) blew a lead, but wouldn’t roll over. The Hornets are used to fighting back and having their back against the wall. The ‘Heart Attack Hornets,’ as the team has grown to calling itself, lost their Western Athletic Conference tournament opener last week and had to win six consecutive games to earn an automatic berth into the NCAA tournament. 
 “Our motto in the fall was 'find a way,’” Sacramento State head coach Reggie Christiansen said. “Even if we do get behind or they tie it up, there was no panic in the dugout. You've got a special group of kids, man. It's been a special ride.” 
 Following last week’s script, Sacramento State answered UC Santa Barbara’s run. It got two runners on in the bottom of the eighth inning, forcing UC Santa Barbara to go to closer Chris Lincoln, who tends to take a few pitches to get in the groove. 
 He grooved a fastball to nine-hole hitter Trevor Doyle, who hit it off the wall in right-center field to score both runners. 
 Santa Barbara couldn’t recover. Flying out three times in the ninth inning, its season came to a close with losses in four of its last five games. 
 “Obviously disappointed it ended like this, it ended this quick. We didn't play particularly well,” Gauchos head coach Andrew Checketts said. “I told the kids after the game don't hang your heads, you'll go down as one of the best Gaucho teams in history.” ",1

 Turk Wendell's son is following in his father's  footsteps in Iowa

 Wyatt Wendell is a lot like his dad Turk. Wyatt leaps over the foul line, wears a necklace full of animal claws and teeth and has some unique game-day routines when he pitches. He’s even pitching in Iowa. 
 Just like his dad. 
 “He taught me how to hunt, fish, play ball and pretty much love all the same stuff he does,” Wyatt said. “So, yeah, I’d say I’m a lot like him in a lot of ways.” 
 Wyatt is trying to follow in the famous footsteps of his father. The right-handed pitcher from Indian Hills Community College is hoping he hears his name called this week during the Major League Baseball First Year Player Draft, which kicks off Monday.

 “I don’t see any reason that he can’t make it to the big-league level for a very long time,” Turk said. “He definitely has what it takes. And I’m pretty much a straight-shooter. If he didn’t, I would tell him that. I would tell him, ‘Hey, ride the wave as long as you can — have fun playing ball. If it happens, it happens.’ But I truly believe he has what it takes.” 
 If anyone knows what it takes to get to the big leagues and stick, it’s Turk Wendell. Turk played 11 seasons in the major leagues with the Chicago Cubs, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies and Colorado Rockies. Wherever he went, he became a fan favorite because of his quirky routines. 
 Wendell would leap highly over the foul line when coming on and off the field and slam the rosin bag onto the mound before facing hitters. During parts of his career, he’d chew black licorice and brush his teeth in between innings. He also wore a necklace filled with elk teeth, turkey spurs and other things he’d gathered while hunting. 
 Some of the traditions have been passed to his son. Wyatt is not only a right-handed pitcher like his dad, but also jumps over the foul line and wears a necklace with bear claws and turkey spurs. 
 And while he doesn’t brush his teeth in the dugout, Wyatt has his own quirks. On days he pitches, he’ll look for spare change and if he finds any, he’ll put it in his cleat and pitch with it in there for good luck.

 The similarities don’t end there, either. Wyatt has turned into a star on the mound. During his first season at Indian Hills, he finished with a 7-4 record and 2.85 ERA. He led the staff in ERA, wins, games started (911), innings pitches (63.1) and strikeouts (56). 
 “He was definitely our best guy,” said Indian Hills coach Matthew Torrez. “Every time he went to the mound, he gave us a chance. He was really, really competitive.” 
 Wyatt has even followed his dad to Iowa. Turk and his unequal antics and success on the mound made him a fan favorite in Des Moines when he pitched for the Iowa Cubs from 1992-1994. Turk enjoyed his time in Iowa so much that he vowed to move back to the state when he retired. 
 So, when his son graduated last year, Turk moved from Colorado back to Iowa. He rented a place in West Des Moines and bought a farm in Adel. He’s lived here since May of 2018. The move worked out well. Wyatt ended up moving to Iowa two months later to play for the Indian Hills baseball team. Wyatt had always wanted to go the junior college route and when he heard about the success of Indian Hills, he figured it was the perfect fit. 
 It’s worked out well for everyone. His dad has been able to watch his games and even speak to the team. 
 “I’m as proud of him as a father as I am of him as a man,” Turk said. “He’s definitely a leader among his peers. And I’m more proud of his dedication and work ethic.” 
 The hard work Wyatt said he’s put in preparing for starts could pay off. Turk said he’s spoken to some major league teams that are interested in Wyatt and could draft him. Wyatt even heard from the Milwaukee Brewers last year. 
 The Brewers even invited him to a private workout at Miller Park a few days before the draft. But when the team couldn’t reach a financial agreement with the family before the draft, they opted not to select him. 
 So, Wyatt ended up at Indian Hills where he’s once again making his case for professional teams. 
 “There’s always a chance,” Wyatt said. “If it’s not this year, I think definitely next year for sure.” 
 Teams may want to wait on Wyatt to continue developing. He currently throws in the high 80s. But Turk and Torrez both believe his velocity could rise, as soon as next season, into the low to mid-90s with some strength and some rest. And if it does, MLB teams will surely come calling for him. 
 “It’s going to happen,” Torrez said. “The arm strength is there. It just needs to come out a little bit. It’s just a matter of when, not if.” 
 And even though Turk never pushed his son to become a big-leaguer like him, he said he’s happy to see the path Wyatt is on. And he even sees a lot of himself in Wyatt. He has for a while, actually. 
 “I remember when he was 12-years-old pitching against a team in Texas,” Turk said. “I kind of looked out there and then I just realized, ‘Wow, that’s my son.’ I was super proud of him with how he was pitching that day. It was just kind of like a light bulb went off.”",1

 Bumpass’ RBI triple helps Cincinnati beat Oregon St. 7-6

 CORVALLIS, Ore. 
 Defending national champion Oregon State finds itself in a surprising predicament: on the verge of elimination in the Corvallis regional of the NCAA baseball tournament. 
 A.J. Bumpass drove a run-scoring triple to the gap in left center off OSU reliever Jake Mulholland with no outs in the top of the ninth inning, scoring Jace Mercer for what proved to be the winning run. 
 Cincinnati squandered a 5-2 lead in the bottom of the seventh inning that included a curious intentional walk to OSU catcher Adley Rutschman with the bases loaded and no outs. That led to a four-run rally, culminated by Andy Armstrong's two-out, run-scoring single, that gave the Beavers their first lead at 6-5. 
 But the Bearcats showed their resiliency in a 7-6 victory Friday night at Goss Stadium.

 Cincinnati's Mason DeAnna scored on Joey Bellini's fielder's choice to tie it in the top of the eighth and Jace Mercer led off the top of the ninth with a single before Bumpass connected on the next pitch to give the Bearcats a one-run lead. 
 Korren Thompson retired the Beavers in order in the bottom of the frame for his 13th save. 
 Bumpass, the American Athletic Conference tournament MVP, was 5 for 5 with three RBI. 
 ""We know who Oregon State is,"" Bumpass said. ""We were not backing down from anybody. That's what we really wanted to do out there."" 
 Top-seeded OSU (36-19-1) plays No. 2 seed Creighton (38-12) in an elimination game Saturday. The Beavers had won 12 consecutive NCAA Regional opening games dating to 2005. 
 Cincinnati (31-29), the No. 4 seed, will play fourth-seeded Michigan (42-18), a 6-0 winner over Creighton in Friday's first game. The Bearcats are making their first NCAA Tournament appearance in 45 years. 
 Cincinnati coach Scott Googins did not second-guess his strategy to walk Rutschman, even though the Bearcats temporarily lost the lead. 
 ""We weren't gonna get beat by the best player in the nation,"" Googins said. ""Oregon State was making a run at us and you put that guy at the plate and who knows?"" 
 Rutschman, the Pac-12 Player of the Year who has been projected by Baseball America to be the No. 1 overall pick in next week's Major League Baseball Draft, said he had never been intentionally walked with the bases loaded. 
 OSU, the national No. 16 seed, needs to win four games in a row over the next three days to win the Corvallis Regional and advance to a best-of-three super regional. 
 ""We've gotta flush it and move on,"" Rutschman said of the defeat. 
 Cincinnati's win was no fluke. 
 The Bearcats outhit the Beavers 15 to 9 and played flawlessly in the field. OSU committed two errors and misplayed several other balls in the outfield. 
 ""I'm not disappointed in our offensive effort, I'm disappointed in our defensive effort,"" OSU interim head coach Pat Bailey said. 
 Cincinnati has come a long way since losing nine of its first 10 games to open the season. 
 OSU, meanwhile, has been struggling, losing five of its last eight games. 
 ""Tomorrow we've got a new life and now it's do or die,"" OSU second baseman Andy Armstrong said. ""So we've gotta show up.""",1

33493,"FRIGHT FIGHT FRIDAY – ICON BRACKET ROUND #4 – CANDYMAN VS PINHEAD!!! 
 Published at: May 31, 2019, 7:43 p.m. CST by AICNStaff 
 Welcome back to FRIGHT FIGHT FRIDAY where every Friday for the next several weeks we will be taking two of our favorite horror movie baddies to face off against each other! There will be 4 brackets, each with 8 fighters. The winner of each bracket will face each other in the finals for the right to fight the winner of our bonus hero bracket! For a full rundown please revert to our announcement! 
 This week we have two very powerful, bloodthirsty competitors for you! Clive Barker’s titans collide! 
 CANDYMAN VS PINHEAD! 
  
 CANDYMAN 
 A victim of his own love Candyman, born Daniel Robitaille, was the son of a former slave who gained a massive amount of wealth. His only crime was falling in love with the daughter of a rich white man who he was commissioned to paint a portrait of. (Yes, Candyman can paint!) She became pregnant with his child and when the father found out, he hired a mob to chase him down, severing his hand and replacing it with a rusty hook and covering him in honey, watching as the bees stung him repeatedly to death. 
 His love, Caroline was forced to watch. After giving Daniel her mirror, he passes away leaving his soul behind forever in her mirror. He now stalks Cabrini Green projects in Chicago (or New Orleans depending on which movie we’re talking about because his background was retconned…) killing to keep the legend of his name alive. They say if you look into a mirror and repeat his name 5 times he will appear, then proceed to murder you brutally. 
 He enjoys painting, wearing large trench coats and bee farming. Did I mention brutal murder? Because he seems to be into that hard. His strengths are the fact that he’s practically immortal, he’s better with a hook than that Peter Pan villain, has superhuman strength and can teleport. Oh, he’s also full of bees. 
 Bees that he can control with his mind or will or whatever. Point is, dude has a ton of bees at his command.  Candyman has only 2 known weaknesses. If Caroline’s mirror is broken, his soul is released ending his reign of terror. His second weakness is that if no one remembers his name and if nobody talks about his legend he grows less and less powerful.  Candyman is an extremely powerful being and will be a tough match for almost any opponent. 
 PINHEAD 
 Our next challenger tonight is a legend in his own right. First appearing in the novella by Clive Barker “The Hell-Bound Heart” Pinhead went on to star in “Hellraiser” and all its 745 sequels. Also known as “The Coldman”, “The Hell Priest” and “The Engineer”. The leader of the Cenobites, extradimensional creatures known as demons to some and as angels to others, who are summoned through the “Lament Configuration” puzzle box. 
 A veteran of World War 1, Elliot became bitter and disenchanted with life after the war. Seeking more, he delved into the occult and the esoteric until coming across the Lament Configuration puzzle box. Solving the puzzle opened the gateway to another dimension where Elliot Spencer was turned in to the being, we now know as Pinhead.  He now abducts others into the realm of “Hell” to harvest their souls. Pinhead is an incredibly powerful being and is even said to oversee hell in Lucifer’s absence. (Refer to the Scarlet Gospels by Clive Barker). 
 His weapons are hooks and chains which he can project and control with his thoughts, at will. His strengths are invincibility, Pinhead is practically immune to all forms of physical assault. He can teleport and in certain cases has even been able to bend reality to his will. He has superhuman level strength and is frighteningly intelligent and articulate. He can also create Cenobites out of his victims. However, he must be summoned by solving the puzzle box. He does not kill indiscriminately (except for in part 3 with that whole losing his human side thing.) He only kills those who beckon him forth with desire. Painfully and slowly. 
 He likes needlepoint, puzzles and shopping for clothes at Hot Topic. Oh, and torturous murder. That’s a big one for this guy.  His weaknesses are limited to trapping him back inside the Lament Configuration puzzle box or destroying it altogether. Also, if you can figure out how to revert him back to his human form he can be harmed, like in Hellraiser 2 – Hell Bound but that was done by a very powerful demon, so yeah. Good luck. And considering we're up to like Hellraiser 115, I’d say that didn’t work too well. To put it simply, Pinhead is one serious opponent. 
 FIGHT 
 Both of our challengers have a similarity in that they both need to be summoned to exist. For imagination's sake, let’s say that an antique collector (we’ll call him Jacque because that sounds like an antique collector’s name) came into a certain old hand mirror. Jacque was into the macabre so upon hearing it’s twisted back story involving Candyman, he had to have it. Same with the “Lament Configuration” puzzle box. Another gem in his collection. One day he was at home bored when he decided to take out Caroline’s mirror. He wasn’t going to say his name or anything. Until he did. “Candyman.” He said quietly, almost to himself. “Candyman, Candyman, Candyman.” He took a deep breath. It was just a stupid urban legend, right? “Candyman!” He blurted. Laughing the moment he said it. He put the mirror down placing it back in its box. “Stupid ghost stories.” He said to himself. Suddenly the lights flickered, he turned around and there he was. Standing in the middle of the room. “Shit!” He yelled. “Be my victim.” “What? No? Absolutely not.” Replied Jacque. “But I have such things to show you.” Said Candyman as bees crawled in and out of his mouth. He walked slowly toward Jacque, bloody hook in the air. In a panic, Jacque turned to the bookshelf, the same one he kept the mirror on and grabbed the first hard looking object he saw. The “Lament Configuration” box. He hurled it as hard as he could at the abomination in his living room. Candyman raises his good hand, catching it with a slight smile. “You insult me with toys?” He asks. There was clicking sound and suddenly the box opened, shifted and turned in his hand. A portal opened in his living room wall and inside of it, a shadowy figure in a long leather trench coat. The figure moved slowly and methodically forward, towards both of them “What the, what the hell?” Jacque asked aloud. “Yes.” Said the slender figure, stepping from the veiled portal revealing himself “Exactly.” He was horrendous to look at. Nails were driven into his head in a grotesque grid-like pattern. The fact that there was no blood dripping from these wounds was even more horrifying.  “What is this?” asked Candyman. “This.” Replies Pinhead “is your hell. Or maybe it’s your Heaven. Matters not to me.” A hook shoots out of Pinheads hand and into Candyman’s chest. He swings his arm downward and rips it out of his skin in one motion. Bee’s fly out of the wound. “The mortal is mine.” Says Candyman. As he strides forward swinging with his hooked hand. It almost connects but Pinhead teleports behind him and sends 2 more razor sharp chains towards Candyman. They hit hard tearing more flesh from his chest and his left cheek. “You think you cause me pain demon? Nothing can cause me more pain than what they did to me. To Caroline.” He disappears and reappears behind Pinhead, slashing him in the back with his rusty hook. “I am pain. And you will both be my victims.” Pinhead levitates into the air; a cold and calm laugh comes from the head Cenobite. “Oh, you have only begun to know pain. Chains shoot out from all directions attaching to Candyman and lifting him into the air. The walls start to catch fire and Pinhead lifts his arms, raising the flames. “You think you are the embodiment of pain?” A large chain wraps around Candyman’s neck, coiling like a snake.  “I am the Hell Priest. I am your suffering. I am your damnation.” Yells Pinhead as the house burns around them. Another one of Pinheads chains flies out, knocking over the box the mirror was in. It wraps around the mirror and brings it to Pinhead. “A Flimsy trinket.” He says. Candyman tries ripping out the chains but the more he removes the more come. Bee’s swarm Pinhead but he is immune to their stings. He raises his hand; closes his fist and they fall to the ground dead. Candyman struggles to get free but its no use. “The source of your power is it not?” Pinhead asks, holding up the mirror. “How quaint.”  He slowly returns to the floor. “You’re not getting off that easy. I will tear your soul apart, but I will make sure that it takes an eternity. Suddenly another chain shoots out form Pinheads hand, this time at Jacque. It sticks into the left side of his chest and he lets out a high pitch squeal. “Shit!” “What do you want?” He asks. “Oh Jacque, it is not I that wants for something my child.” “I don’t want anything. It wasn’t me! He opened the box…” “It is not hands that call us, but desire.” Replied Pinhead. A chain shoots from Pinheads hand, a hook as sharp as razors on the end of it. It slices Jacque’s cheek open as it wraps around his head. Slowly constricting. “And we have many sights to see and things to explore.” Jacque and Candyman are both carried towards the portal by the ghastly chains. Blood pooled on the floor as the walls crumbled from the fire. 3 other figures emerge from the portal to greet Candyman and Jacque. One was fat and grotesque, another a woman with a hole in her neck. The third was grotesquely disfigured and could only chatter its teeth. “Show them the true meaning of pain.” Says Pinhead laughing as they disappear back into the portal. “I’ll see you in Hell!” he laughs as the roof falls in around him and the flames shoot up into the night sky. As the last standing parts of the house fall in on themselves the Hell Priest, Pinhead walks into the portal and the Lament Configuration box reforms and closes. 
 PINHEAD 
 For me, this one was fun. Both challengers are very powerful but, in my opinion, Pinhead has a large upper hand. Not only is he practically invincible, but he's also a reaper of souls. Candyman is a soul who refused to leave this earth realm. In truth, Pinhead would probably be his boss.  This round goes to Pinhead. Quite easily in my opinion. 
 Well, there we have it. Round 4 is in the bag! Check back next week for Round 5! Jason VS Chucky! Remember to upvote your favorite fighter and comment below! Until next time, keep on geekin’ on my friends!

 Leonid Bershidsky 
 ""Chernobyl,"" the HBO miniseries that ends Monday in the U.S., isn't easy to watch as someone who lived in the Soviet Union in 1986 and who has since visited the Chernobyl exclusion zone. But, like many of my compatriots, I'm watching it — and thinking it should have been made in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus, not by an American entertainment channel. 
 There are two reasons for this. One is authenticity — despite a valiant attempt at it, the series falls short. But the other, more important reason is that this kind of harsh sermon on the importance of listening to experts and running a government for the people, not for its own sake, should have come from one of the affected countries. Those countries, apparently, haven't learned the lessons well enough to make a movie like this. 
 The authenticity part will probably be lost not just on Western viewers but also on the younger generation of post-Soviet ones too. The producers tried hard to re-create the late Soviet material culture, even though it does look as though they found the objects at a flea market — they look 30 years the worse for wear. 
 Details are off 
 Some lapses were probably too costly to avoid even when the filmmakers knew about them, like modern plastic windows in Soviet buildings. But there's plenty more. Chernobyl is too far from Moscow to reach by helicopter, and in reality, the government commission sent there soon after the nuclear disaster took a plane to Kiev and then drove. Nor, of course, could Deputy Prime Minister Boris Shcherbina even imagine threatening to throw Valery Legasov, an esteemed member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, off a helicopter — this was 1986, not 1936. 
 Legasov, one of the series' central characters, did indeed hang himself two years after the Chernobyl disaster, having first taped his memories of it. But, as a top-flight scientist, he didn't live in a dingy apartment with a characteristic deer rug on the wall: That would have been far below his station. Nor was a cat his only companion: As he sickened after multiple trips to the exploded nuclear power station, his wife and daughter took care of him. 
 I know for a fact from several reporting trips that Russian miners don't drink vodka right at the mine, before they wash off the coal dust. And in the late '80s, they didn't require soldiers with assault rifles to keep them in check when a minister addressed them. For that matter, the soldiers in the series appear to hold their weapons U.S. style, butt to the armpit, not Soviet-style, across the chest. 
 Soviet people in 1986 didn't go calling each other ""comrade"" except at Communist Party meetings. Ilya Repin's dramatic painting of Ivan the Terrible realizing he'd just killed his son was never housed in the Kremlin. And some uniforms in the series are from the wrong period. 
 Liam Daniel/HBO 
 Emily Watson in HBO's ""Chernobyl."" 
 Emily Watson in HBO's ""Chernobyl."" (Liam Daniel/HBO) 
 All these inaccuracies, big and small, mitigate the harshness of the movie for viewers with friends and family affected by the disaster. (My ex-father-in-law was one of the 600,000 so-called liquidators involved in the cleanup.) They serve as a filter, a reminder that this is, after all, an American TV series, not a documentary, and that none of the horrible things on the screen are real. 
 Universal themes 
 But even with that filter, the tough messages of the series come through loud and clear. For one thing, people are often unprepared for the enormity of something like the Chernobyl disaster; they tend to get confused, and try to fool themselves into thinking that the world isn't actually collapsing around them. That goes both for people on the immediate scene and for the big bosses saddled with the final responsibility. These are situations when experts should be called in immediately and allowed to make decisions unhindered by political expediency or established chains of command. No amount of heroism and fatalism, powerfully portrayed in the series, is an adequate replacement for expertise. 
 Of course, cover-ups and defensiveness in such situations are heinous crimes; the Soviet Union tersely admitted the Chernobyl disaster to the world two days after it took place, and Communist Party leader Mikhail Gorbachev took 18 days before he spoke about it to the nation. By then, much of the area around the power plant had been evacuated, but May Day parades had taken place in nearby cities even though it could have been dangerous for people to be out in the open. By the time he felt free to speak, Gorbachev focused on criticizing Western reports blaming the Soviet Union for the disaster. The reports would have been there in any case, but they would have been more accurate had the Soviet Union not tried to conceal the extent of the damage. (Russian media researcher Nataliya Rostova wrote a good account of the belated official reaction and attempts to keep journalists from reporting on Chernobyl.) 
 Remarkably, some Russian reactions to the series are in that vein too. The pro-Kremlin daily Komsomolskaya Pravda published a column suggesting that the series is an attempt to undermine Russia's leadership in nuclear reactor exports, one of the few areas in which Russia is ahead of the U.S. and actively competing for European and Asian markets. The idea, Komsomolskaya Pravda journalist Dmitry Steshin wrote, is to incite the European public against Russian nuclear projects. I've read plenty of similar comments on social media; the series has been accused of that ultimate sin, ""Russophobia."" 
 The Russian reaction 
 It's clear to most Russian viewers, though, that the HBO production is not some kind of American propaganda effort. The messages are universal: about the limitations of government, management and the human psyche when faced with unforeseen effects of technology. Russians are not portrayed as villains in ""Chernobyl."" Even Stellan Skarsgard's portrayal of apparatchik Shcherbina — who ordered the prompt evacuation of the town of Pripyat though many argued against it — is, in general, sympathetic. 
 The question that keeps popping up in my mind is why none of the three ex-Soviet countries most affected by Chernobyl has produced such a powerful re-creation of the 1986 events for the world's edification. It would have made sense for Russia, with its current nuclear leadership, to show that it has learned the lessons; a posthumous Hero of Russia star for Legasov, awarded by former President Boris Yeltsin, isn't enough. 
 It would have made sense for Ukraine too; when I visited the Chernobyl zone in 2012, an illicit trade in potentially contaminated scrap metal was flourishing there amid the ruins and overgrown, abandoned villages. 
 Belarus, heavily victimized by the Chernobyl fallout, would have been a fitting messenger too. 
 Yet somehow it was the network that produced ""Game of Thrones"" that found the courage, the money and the considerable skill that went into the making of ""Chernobyl."" Now, the world at large will know the story from this version. That the post-Soviet nations left it to  HBO is, of course, not comparable with the original Soviet failure to report openly on the disaster. It is, however, a regrettable sin of omission that in the 33 years that have passed since Chernobyl's Reactor 4 blew up that the post-Soviet world hasn't produced anything as compelling as HBO's flawed but riveting product.

 “The taste of Lebanon” is what a group of Lebanese-Canadian ladies are serving during the Lebanese Cedar Festival this weekend in Halifax. 
 Lebanese community members in the city come together for four days to introduce their culture to the rest of society. 
 One of the most famous Lebanese meals is manaeesh or manakeesh, which is a popular food in Lebanon, Syria and neighbouring levant countries. It consists of dough topped with thyme, cheese, olives, tomato, or ground meat. 
 Katia Hobeishe has made manaeesh for long time. Her mother taught her how to make them when they were living in the mountainous village of Dimane in northern Lebanon 50 years ago. 
 At the time, every household had to make its own bread. “Every week, when my mother prepared the dough for the bread, we kept some to make manaeesh,” Hobeishe said. 
 This sort of food makes her remember her childhood in Lebanon when the family would gather to eat manaeesh and drink coffee. “Is there anything more delicious? I don’t think so,” she said. 
 Food is not only a fuel to the human body, it’s also an important part of people’s culture and identity. 
 For 13 years, Hobeishe and her friends have made manaeesh for Haligonians during the Lebanese Cedar Festival. 
 “Basically, the manaeesh are made of cheese or thyme. Yet, we can add olives, mint, tomato,” Hubaish said. “We can make it half cheese and half thyme.” 
 “It’s fresh, crispy and delicious,” she said. “We make samples, so people can try them, so they love them.” 
 Other than during the festival, they make them in the church when people are fasting, and during Easter and Christmas. 
 Hobeishe immigrated to Canada 32 years ago with her husband, who works now at the Halifax airport. They have two daughters and one son. The oldest is married and has two kids. They often visit Lebanon in the summers. 
 The festival’s food area includes sections that serve falafel, shawarma, fatayer, kibbeh and many types of Arabian sweets. All the food is made by Lebanese hands. 
 “It’s a team work. It’s co-operation,” said Rima Toulany, one of the participants in the manaeesh making. She makes sure all the required ingredients are there, so the other ladies don’t stop their work because of the high demand. 
 “The women and the men of our parish get together, working as one to make this possible,” said Laina Metlej, one of the festival organizers. “We want a lot of people to see our culture and our traditions — the taste of Lebanon here in Halifax.” 
 From generation to generation, Lebanese people pass on recipes to make the food that represents their culture using the same ingredients as they would do in Lebanon, Metlej said. 
 “Our elderly women teach us and guide us. … It’s our duty as the young generation of the Lebanese community to take it on in the future.”

 Trump Bets the U.S. Economy on Tariffs 
 WASHINGTON — President Trump is upending the United States economy, and perhaps jeopardizing his re-election prospects, with an abrupt escalation of protectionist trade policies. Mr. Trump announced on Thursday that he would soon impose a 5 percent tariff on imports from Mexico, which could quickly grow to 25 percent, unless Mexican officials stop the flow of immigrants across America’s southern border. The move capped a furious month of cross-border tariff threats that has rattled investors and raised economists’ concerns about a slowdown in global growth. Just three weeks ago, Mr. Trump i...

 'Getting his sea legs back.'  After resigning from office, Greitens tries to steady his life — in private

 JEFFERSON CITY — As governor, Eric Greitens was a secretive chief executive who worked hard to manage his own narrative by avoiding the press and appearing only in controlled settings. 
 While that approach to governing melted under the heat of a scandal, it comes as no surprise the Republican has stayed off the radar in the year since he left office. 
 No interviews. No public appearances. No news of his whereabouts. 
 But now, on the anniversary of Greitens’ departure, new information is beginning to seep out about Missouri’s 56th chief executive. 
 For one, the Navy says the former Navy SEAL is making a return to the military, which he used as an asset during his 2016 campaign to become governor. 
 Greitens, 45, is not going back into combat, but will serve as an officer in the Naval Reserve, a Navy information officer said. 
 He’s also returned to writing, this time working on a book about his Jewish faith. It’s unclear whether he has a publisher lined up, and the former governor may have to answer for literary fraud accusations leveled against him in regard to his third book, “Resilience.” 
 Through contacts with former employees of the governor’s office, the Post-Dispatch learned Greitens has hosted occasional cookouts at the $675,000 house he and his wife, University of Missouri political science professor Sheena Greitens, bought in the Warren County vacation town of Innsbrook after he became governor. 
 “I think he’s doing well,” said former state Sen. John Lamping, a friend of Greitens. “I think it was a pretty crazy period and time. I know he’s spent most of the time just with his family, a lot of time out at Innsbrook.” 
 Lamping says he hasn’t visited Innsbrook but said the two have met in between Innsbrook and Lamping’s home in Augusta. Lamping said Greitens hasn’t mentioned running for office again, but he said they do talk about the state of politics in Missouri. 
 “He knows that I was pretty involved in trying to defeat this merger proposition,” Lamping said of the St. Louis-St. Louis County merger proposal known as Better Together. “We really just talk about that kind of stuff. He’s really just getting his sea legs back.” 
 Rise, fall and aftermath 
 Greitens’ entrance into the political scene in Missouri came in 2015. The political newcomer crafted a tough guy, outsider image to win his first race for office in the August 2016 Republican primary for governor. 
 But in January 2018, news broke that Greitens had been having an affair at the same time he was launching his bid for office. Within five turbulent months, he would be gone. 
 Greitens admits affair, but denies allegation he blackmailed woman with photo 
 Greitens' lawyer: ""No violence. No picture taken. No threat of blackmail."" 
 Greitens admitted he had an affair, but denied an allegation that he threatened the woman with a compromising photograph. 
 Besides the affair, Greitens faced allegations of campaign finance violations, including using a charity donor list to raise campaign contributions — and then lying to the Missouri Ethics Commission about how he obtained the list. 
 In announcing his resignation, Greitens said he did not deserve the onslaught: “I have not broken any laws or committed any offense worthy of this treatment.” 
 Although it’s been a year since he left office on June 1, investigations continue related to his downfall. 
 The Missouri Ethics Commission has not completed its report into a complaint filed by the chairman of the legislative investigatory panel. The complaint alleged multiple campaign finance violations. 
 That has resulted in Greitens tapping his once formidable campaign fund for more than $1 million to pay teams of attorneys to defend him. 
 Most of the campaign cash for attorneys went to the Husch Blackwell firm, where attorney Catherine Hanaway is a partner. Hanaway, who lost to Greitens in the 2016 GOP primary for governor, has represented Greitens in his various legal battles. 
 Records show Greitens also continues to keep campaign aides on the payroll, including Scott Turk, who had been on the state payroll during a part of Greitens’ abbreviated 17 months in office. 
 Gov. Mike Parson, the former lieutenant governor who succeeded Greitens, continues to defend the office in court against two Sunshine Law lawsuits related to Greitens’ time in office. 
 Loose ends 
 The money in Greitens’ campaign fund is separate from a nonprofit that was formed after his election that raised almost $6.1 million from secret donors in 2017. 
 The organization, known as A New Missouri, is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that operated opaquely during Greitens’ abbreviated tenure. The organization does not appear to be active. 
 Though the sources of the vast majority of the $6.1 million raised are unclear, the Center for Responsive Politics reported this month that A New Missouri received $500,000 from the Judicial Crisis Network, a secretive group that promotes conservative judges. 
 Meanwhile, one of the targets of Greitens’ former legal defense team, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner, faces an investigation into how her office handled the prosecution of Greitens. 
 In mid-May, a special grand jury examining perjury allegations against an investigator hired by Gardner was extended for up to 60 days. 
 The probe centers on William Don Tisaby, the private investigator Gardner picked to look into allegations against Greitens. 
 The source of $120,000 in cash delivered to anti-Greitens attorney Albert Watkins is still unclear. 
 Watkins represented the husband of Greitens’ ex-lover, and he disseminated transcripts of recorded conversations in which the woman described her affair with the future governor. 
 Watkins said the money went toward his client’s legal bills, not to his client. 
 “My client did not get a dime,” Watkins told the Post-Dispatch. “It went to pay attorneys fees.” 
 Even the Navy has Greitens under a microscope. 
 On Friday, the Washington Post reported that the chief of naval operations, Adm. John Richardson, has called for a 30-day review of how the service handles personnel cases involving personal misconduct allegations, including Greitens’. 
 In a May 26 email obtained by the Post, Richardson said Navy policies for addressing misconduct are “too cumbersome and slow” and the results could weaken “the ethical fiber of our Navy” and put the service “in a situation that is hard to explain to ourselves, and even more difficult to explain to the American people.” 
 Staff moves on 
 After the moving trucks pulled away from the Governor’s Mansion carrying the Greitens family’s possessions, the main core of his staff also exited their warren of offices on the Capitol’s second floor. Some went tearfully. Others said they were ready for a new, perhaps less stressful, chapter of their lives. 
 His chief counsel, Lucinda Luetkemeyer, returned to private law practice. Her husband, Tony Luetkemeyer, was elected months later to a seat in the Missouri Senate. 
 In her online biography, Luetkemeyer notes that she worked for the governor of Missouri, but doesn’t name Greitens as that governor. 
 Greitens’ chief legislative aide, Will Scharf, left Missouri for a job in Washington. 
 “While I was obviously disappointed with how our administration ended, serving the people of Missouri was a tremendous honor and privilege, and I am grateful to Gov. Greitens for giving me that opportunity,” Scharf said. 
 Austin Chambers, a Georgia political operative who oversaw Greitens’ campaign for the seat and served as his political consultant after he was elected, is now the Republican State Leadership Committee president. 
 In Chambers’ biography on the RSLC website, he lists a string of campaign victories, but also doesn’t use Greitens’ name. 
 After departing as Greitens’ communications director, Parker Briden served as a spokesman for unsuccessful Nevada gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt. He is now spokesman for Mississippi Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who is running for governor there. 
 Just a handful of staffers stuck around to work for Missouri’s current governor, Republican Mike Parson, who was sworn in the day Greitens left office. 
 In taking over, Parson made it a mission to calm the waters in state government. 
 Where Greitens openly fought with members of the General Assembly, Parson, a former lawmaker, sought to work with the Legislature to get his priorities passed into law. 
 Despite multiple attempts over the past year, Greitens has not responded to interview requests from the Post-Dispatch.

 European shares slide at end of a miserable May 
 Trump’s tariff threat on Mexican imports sends investors scrambling for safer ground 
 Fri, May 31, 2019, 18:44

 European stocks fell on Friday, with auto-makers hit especially hard, after US president Donald Trump widened the scope of his trade wars by threatening to impose new tariffs on Mexican imports. 
 Investors exited riskier equity positions and moved to safer ground, sending defensive stocks higher and yields on German bonds to record lows. 
 DUBLIN 
 The Iseq fell 0.8 per cent in line with the poor end to the week across Europe, as gains for some key stocks offset declines for Ryanair and CRH. 
 The building materials group, the largest stock on the market, dropped 1.6 per cent to finish the week at €27.99, while the airline lost more than 4 per cent to close at €10.01, after smaller budget airline Wizz Air echoed its remarks about “limited visibility” for the sector in the second half of 2019. 
 Drinks group C&C lost the gains it made in Thursday’s session, with the stock closing down 4.1 per cent at just below €3.65. 
 Kingspan rose almost 2 per cent to €46.66, while Bank of Ireland advanced more than 0.5 per cent to €4.80. Cairn Homes was another climber, adding 2 per cent to €1.22. Total Produce added 3.3 per cent to €139.50 after a short trading statement in which it said it was targeting continued growth for 2019. 
 LONDON 
 The FTSE 100 fell almost 1 per cent on Friday after the White House tariff threats, while disappointing manufacturing data from China stoked global downturn fears. 
 Financial stocks fell more than 1 per cent and mining stocks were off almost 2 per cent, while exporters such as British American Tobacco, Diageo and Unilever suffered as the dollar weakened. However, the macroeconomic uncertainty aided precious metals miner Fresnillo, which gained 2.8 per cent. 
 Wizz Air, the Geneva-based airline with a listing in London, closed down 2.3 per cent, having traded about 5 per cent lower earlier in the session. 
 The airline highlighted a “challenging operating environment”, but said it expected to gain market share as rivals battle with higher fuel prices and summer industrial disruption. 
 AIM-listed Stride Gaming surged 25 per cent after it agreed to a takeover by Rank Group , which said the deal would create the number two player in UK online bingo, lifting its own shares by 4.7 per cent. 
 EUROPE 
 The pan-Europe Stoxx 600 fell 0.8 per cent on the day to close out May with a 5.7 per cent slide, its worst monthly loss since January 2016. 
 In Germany , the exporter-heavy Dax fell 1.5 per cent to a five-month closing low, while the Spanish market was also hard hit, losing 1.7 per cent. The French Cac 40 was down 0.8 per cent. 
 Trump’s move hit European stocks exposed to Mexico , including Madrid-listed banks Santander, Sabadell and Bilbao, which slid between 2.4 per cent and 4.1 per cent. 
 Carmakers and their suppliers shed 2 per cent, while Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen – which import cars to the US from Mexican plants – shed 4.8 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively. 
 Milan-listed stocks fell 0.7 per cent, after lenders were hit by the Bank of Italy warning that public debt could rise more than forecast this year. 
 US 
 Wall Street’s main indexes fell sharply on Friday, hit by fears that Trump’s shock threat of tariffs on Mexico could prove the trigger that pushes the US into recession. 
 Carmakers and manufacturers were among the worst hit. General Motors dropped 4.2 per cent and Ford Motor Company was down 2.9 per cent in early trading. 
 FAANG stocks – Facebook, Apple, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon – declined between 0.8 per cent and 2.5 per cent. 
 Gap tumbled 11.1 per cent, the most among S&P 500 companies, after the clothing retailer cut its 2019 profit forecast. Constellation Brands, which has substantial brewery operations in Mexico, slid 6.6 per cent.

 Concerns over exaggerated health claims prompt FDA hearing on effects of CBD products

 Posted: May 31, 2019 1:40 PM 
 Posted By: CNN 
 Cannabis-related products have flooded the market, making health claims about pain relief, immune function and anxiety and depression. But the US Food and Drug Administration says there is little known about how effective they are. On Friday, the FDA held its first hearing to assess the safety and efficacy of CBD products. 
 In opening the hearing Dr. Ned Sharpless, acting commissioner of the FDA, said despite the widespread use of such products ""critical questions remain about the safety"" of these items. 
 Products touting CBD and THC -- two of the active ingredients in cannabis -- can be found in foods, dietary supplements, and even cosmetics. 
 ""While we have seen an explosion of interest in products containing CBD, there is still much that we don't know,"" said Sharpless. 
 CBD, also known as cannabidiol, is the ingredient in marijuana and hemp touted to have many medicinal benefits. It's different from tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, the main psychoactive component of cannabis. 
 Sharpless pointed out that prior to the passage of last year's farm bill, which removed hemp as a controlled substance, much of the research into cannabis looked at the plant as a whole, rather than specific components like CBD. 
 ""When hemp was removed as a controlled substance, this lack of research, and therefore evidence, to support CBD's broader use in FDA-regulated products, including in foods and dietary supplements, has resulted in unique complexities for its regulation, including many unanswered questions related to its safety,"" he said. 
 Today's hearing, he said, would inform the agency as it moved forward with determining how to regulate CBD. 
 'Only limited available information about CBD' 
 Last June, the FDA for the first time approved a cannabis plant-derived, CBD-based drug, Epidiolex, which is approved to treat two severe and rare forms of epilepsy: Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. 
 Dr. Amy Abernathy, principal deputy commissioner of the FDA and head of the agency's CBD working group, said in a tweet last week, ""The FDA has not approved any other CBD-containing products. We want consumers to be aware that there is only limited available information about CBD, including about its effects on the body."" 
 Witnesses from the supplement industry, researchers, doctors and patients are all expected to testify about their experiences with cannabis at Friday's hearing. The agency will also make a docket available for public comments that will close on July 2. 
 In April, then-FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb warned in a statement that ""open questions remain regarding the safety"" of widespread use of CBD products.  He also noted there are concerns about a lack of standards around CBD concentrations in products and the possible impacts of long-term CBD use. 
 ""It's critical that we address these unanswered questions about CBD and other cannabis and cannabis-derived products to help inform the FDA's regulatory oversight of these products,"" he said. ""Especially as the agency considers whether it could be appropriate to exercise its authority to allow the use of CBD in dietary supplements and other foods."" 
 It is illegal to introduce CBD or THC into the food supply or market it as a dietary supplement. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law. However, at least 10 states have moved ahead and legalized the purchase and possession of recreational marijuana while 33 states allow the use of medical marijuana. 
 A market in the billions 
 As states have liberalized the use of marijuana, CBD-related products such as oils , lotions , chocolates and even dog food have stormed the market. 
 Market analysts expect the hemp-derived CBD market alone to hit between $ 15-20 billion in the next five to six years. 
 ""The industry is exploding, it's growing in popularity every day. It's so important for the FDA to get a regulatory handle on this,"" said Jonathan Miller, general counsel for the US Hemp Roundtable , an industry-backed advocacy group. ""There are bad products out there. There are products that make false claims. It's important that FDA develop standards."" 
 Earlier this year, FDA sent warning letters to PotNetwork Holdings in Florida, Nutra Pure in Washington state and Advanced Spine and Pain in New Jersey for ""making unsubstantiated claims related to more than a dozen different products and spanning multiple product webpages, online stores and social media websites."" These companies made claims that CBD could help with cancer and dementia. 
 Since 2015, the FDA has issued 48 similar type letters about the marketing of CBD products. 
 Miller said the industry wants regulation. ""Our biggest enemy isn't the FDA or the DEA, but CBD companies making false claims,"" he said. 
 'The genie' is 'out of the bottle' 
 ""There needs to be clear steps in informing the public that there is no science behind the generic claims made about CBD,"" Dr. Yasmin Hurd , director of the Addiction Institute at Mount Sinai in New York and a cannabis researcher, wrote in an email to CNN. 
 But Hurd worries that the FDA is coming to the table too late. 
 ""The market and the public have already let the genie out of the bottle and it will be difficult to put it back in without the FDA and government showing clear proof that there is evidence showing a negative health impact,"" she said. 
 While a timeline hasn't been set by the FDA, Miller is hopeful that the FDA will prioritize creating regulations for cannabis-based products. He anticipates that CBD can be regulated both as a drug and as supplement, potentially based on dosing and concentration. 
 Maintaining a distinction between a medical research pathway and a supplements pathway is key, Hurd said. 
 ""It is critical that the FDA consider making a distinct pathway to expedite CBD research to thus make it possible to quickly inform policy makers, patients and physicians about the potential health impact, dosing regimens, adverse effects as necessary for the development of any medication. It needs to be clear that such a pathway would be different from recreational or nutraceutical/supplement market."" 
 The FDA's Sharpless agreed: ""Drugs have important therapeutic value, and it is critical that we continue to do what we can to support the science needed to develop new drugs from cannabis.""

90706,"South Carolina Doctor Will Pay $92,506.30 for Allegedly Engaging in an Illegal Kickback Scheme 
 Saturday, June 1, 2019 3:42 
 % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents. 
 A South Carolina doctor has agreed to pay the government $92,506.30 for allegedly accepting illegal kickback payments from OK Compounding, L.L.C., announced U.S. Attorney Trent Shores. 
 The U.S. Attorney’s Office entered into a settlement agreement with Jerry Back, 62, a medical doctor, in an effort to recoup the costs to the U.S. government resulting from the illegal kickbacks. 
 This is the eighth kickback settlement since January in the Northern District of Oklahoma. The civil settlements arose from an investigation into numerous health care providers writing prescriptions for pain creams compounded and sold by OK Compounding. 
 “It is no secret that my office remains focused on protecting the integrity of our federal health care system by holding accountable unscrupulous doctors who have allegedly cheated insurance programs,” said U.S. Attorney Shores. “We will use all tools at our disposal, including civil and criminal remedies, to halt illegal and corrupt practices by medical professionals.” 
 “This settlement highlights the commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) and its law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of the Department of Defense health care program known as TRICARE,” said DCIS Special Agent in Charge Michael C. Mentavlos. “DCIS will aggressively investigate those health care providers that attempt to defraud the DoD, in order to preserve American taxpayer dollars intended to care for our warfighters, their family members, and our military retirees.” 
 Beginning in 2013, Dr. Back prescribed these pain creams for his patients, facilitating the sale and distribution of the creams.  As compensation for his services, OK Compounding paid Dr. Back what was characterized by the parties as “medical director fees” based upon an hourly rate.  However, the payments Dr. Back received from the company were, in actuality, “kickbacks.”  Because Dr. Back’s patients were insured with TRICARE, a Department of Defense federal health care program for veterans, the kickbacks were in violation of the False Claims Act.  It is illegal to pay or receive “kickbacks” in conjunction with federal health care insurance. 
 Prohibitions against kickbacks are crucial to insure that financial motives do not undermine the medical judgment of physicians and other health care providers.  The civil False Claims Act is an important tool used to protect the integrity of taxpayer-funded health care programs. 
 The settlement resolves allegations that Dr. Back had an illegal financial relationship with OK Compounding, concerning pain creams from February through May of 2013. 
 Affirmative Civil Enforcement (ACE) refers to filing civil lawsuits on behalf of the United States.  The purpose of these civil actions is to recover government money lost to fraud or other misconduct or to impose penalties for violations of Federal health, safety, civil rights or environmental laws. 
 To report fraud and abuse against the Federal government in the Northern District of Oklahoma, please contact the U.S. Attorney’s Office at 918-382-2700 and speak to a member of the ACE Unit. 
 Information for fraud against TRICARE can be reported at https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Access-Cost-Quality-and-Safety/Quality-And-Safety-of-Healthcare/Program-Integrity/Fraud-and-Abuse-Report-Submission-Form. 
 This matter was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Marianne Hardcastle, and is the product of a collaborative investigation by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Department of Labor – Office of Inspector General (OIG), IRS – Criminal Investigation Division, U.S. Postal Service – OIG, FBI, Department of Veterans Affairs – OIG and the Department of Health and Human Services – OIG. 
 The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.",1

 Massive Explosion Rocks Russian Munitions Plant; Dozens Injured, 200 Buildings Damaged

 SHARES 
 Several explosions rocked an explosives plant in the central Russian city of Dzerzhinsk, according to  RT . 
 ""A big explosion roared, my ears popped and then sirens went off. In a minute, there was another blast, windows shattered, and a column of smoke rose, and there was fire,"" one witness told RT. 
 The facilities damaged in the blast are part of Russia's scientific and research institute ‘Kristall’. It specializes in scientific and technological support for work related to the production of explosive materials and devises its safety measures. 
 This is the third blast suffered by the TNT-maker over the past year. Last August, five workers were killed in an explosion at the site, and in April an explosion destroyed a one-story building but caused no injuries. - RT 
 SOUND WARNING: 
 At least 79 people were injured with 16 hospitalized, while nearly 200 buildings were damaged. Authorities report that 38 plant employees and four local residents were among the injured, and were treated for burns and glass cuts. 
 A first explosion triggered two other blasts at the same facility and then fire. Five buildings were destroyed at the plant and 200 others were damaged throughout the city. People saw their windows shattered and ceiling coverings collapse. 
 ... 
 More than 300 people and 50 technical units were involved in the response to the blast. It took firefighters several hours to extinguish the blaze that covered 800 square meters. - RT 
 A criminal investigation has been launched into the explosions.

 Moby cancels book tour after Natalie Portman controversy 
 (CNN) - The Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas has issued an apology to rapper Meek Mill after he accused them of being ""racist as hell."" 
 Last week, the artist posted videos of an interaction with hotel staff in which he was apparently told he would be arrested for trespassing if he entered the hotel. 
 In a series of tweets alongside the clips, Meek Mill said he needed ""lawyers ASAP"" and accused the hotel of being ""racist as hell,"" adding, ""If you come from our culture you should never step foot in the cosmopolitan hotel."" 
 On Friday, the hotel issued an apology for the May 25 incident, saying they did ""not act in a respectful manner and were wrong."" 
 ""Meek Mill has not had any prior incidents on our property,"" the statement posted on the hotel's Twitter page said. ""The Cosmopolitan has zero tolerance for discrimination and we pride ourselves on providing an inclusive environment. We look forward to welcoming Meek Mill back to the resort. 
 Earlier this week, the hotel defended its actions by saying the issue was a ""matter of security, not race,"" and that staff was not allowing Meek Mill entrance due to capacity concerns of a club at the premises. It was unclear whether Meek Mill was trying to enter the club. 
 Meek Mill's attorney called the capacity claims ""outright false."" 
 ""In the recorded video, Meek also inquired about getting a meal at one of the hotel's restaurants, yet their security team continued to deny Meek and said he would be arrested for trespassing regardless of location in the hotel premises. The Cosmopolitan's conduct continues to be deplorable,"" Joe Tacopina said in a statement at the time. 
 Didier Morais, the rapper's publicist, sent an updated statement from Tacopina which read: ""We appreciate the Cosmopolitan's apology and will no longer pursue legal recourse at this time.""

 If Cypress Ranch wasn’t undisputedly the state’s top team this year, the Mustangs weren’t far from the top. 
 But their season stops short of where they wanted. 
 McKinney Boyd topped Cypress Ranch 8-3 in the Class 6A Region II championship series finale on Saturday at University of Mary Hardin-Baylor. 
 Boyd (30-14) won 1-0 in Thursday’s Game 2 to even a series that had a completely different tone considering the no-hitter from Cypress Ranch senior pitcher Matt Thompson in Game 1. 
 Game 3 was tightly contested, too, with the two teams tied at three after four innings. 
 The fifth inning is where Boyd’s bats took over, scoring four running in the top half of the frame and adding one more in the sixth inning. 
 A three-run third inning proved huge for Boyd, too, as it erased the first-inning two-RBI single from Cypress Ranch’s Fabian Mayfield, who finished with all of the Mustangs’ RBIs Saturday. 
 Boyd is state-bound for the first time. Cypress Ranch was looking for a second consecutive state semifinal and a fourth state tournament appearance all-time, which is impressive considering the high school is just 11 years old. Cypress Ranch won state championships in 2012 and 2015. 
 And concerning this Cypress Ranch team (34-6-1), all eyes turn toward the MLB First-Year Player Draft beginning Monday. Thompson and pitcher J.J. Goss – both seniors and Texas A&M commitments – are expected to be high draft picks. 
 The Cypress Ranch and Magnolia West losses makes it two Houston-area teams in the state tournament field next week in Austin. 
 Ridge Point won 6A Region III with a sweep of Kingwood. The Panthers are state-bound for the first time. 
 Sweeny, 60 miles southwest of Houston, won the 4A Region III championship series against Robinson 2-1 and is in a state semifinal for the second consecutive season.

 A search is underway for seven climbers -- four Britons, two Americans and an Australian -- and their Indian liaison officer, who went missing a week ago during an expedition in the Indian Himalayas , local authorities say. 
 The group was attempting to scale Nanda Devi East, one of the highest and most difficult to climb peaks in India at just over 24,000 feet (7,400 meters) tall, local Uttarakhand District Magistrate, Vijay Kumar Jogdande, told CNN. 
 The missing eight were part of a larger team of 12 who set off from the village of Munsiyari on May 13. But 12 days later, on May 25, only four of the group returned to base camp, said Uttarakhand's Senior District Official, R.D. Paliwal. 
 Rogue Mont Blanc climbers could face two years in prison 
 The entire group was supposed to reach its base camp on May 26, according to Jogdande. The base camp is located at 19,685 feet (6,000 meters) above sea level. 
 The company which arranged the expedition, Himalayan Run & Trek, waited a few days after the remaining members of the team failed to arrive before alerting authorities of their disappearance on May 31, Jogdande said.

 The Indian liaison officer who is among the missing is from the Indian Mountaineering foundation, based in New Delhi. 
 The UK Foreign Office said in a statement it was in contact with Indian authorities following reports that the climbers were missing. 
 Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also said it was ""providing consular assistance to the family of an Australian that may be among a group of trekkers missing in the Nanda Devi area of India."" 
 Exhilaration and terror -- what it's really like to tackle Everest's deadly peak 
 Three search teams have now reached the first base camp, which is 25 kilometers below the peak. Another team, equipped with medical and civil supplies, is also on its way. A military aircraft is expected to be sent tomorrow to help with the rescue effort. 
 It is unclear whether the climbers went missing during their ascent or descent, or the cause of their disappearance. 
 It follows the deaths of 11 climbers on Mount Everest this year, amid extraordinary images of queues of people waiting to get to the summit, prompting fresh concerns over the increased commercialization of mountaineering expeditions.

50248,"No Mr. Nice guy: Buboy confident ruthless Pacquiao will show up vs Thurman 
 INQUIRER.net / 09:37 PM June 01, 2019 
 CONTRIBUTED PHOTO 
 MANILA, Philippines—Manny Pacquiao won’t be Mr. Nice Guy against Keith Thurman, as far as his trainer and childhood friend Buboy Fernandez is concerned. 
 Pacquiao seemed to have lost his killer’s instinct in the latter part of his career but Fernandez expects the eight-division champion to revert back to his merciless ways and put the trash-talking Thurman in his place in their welterweight title unification bout on July 21 (Manila time) in Las Vegas.

 “Tama na yung sobrang bait tayo. Ang pinaguusapan dito yung career mo atsaka yung reputasyon mo sa tao, paano ka nirerespeto ng tao. Turuan mo si Thurman kung paano ka niya respetuhin,” Fernandez told reports Friday. 
 (We’ve been nice for too long. What’s at stake here is your career, your reputation and how you’re going to be respected by people. You need to show Thurman that he has to respect you.)

 Thurman, who is 10 years younger at 30, has been talking a lot of smack, saying that he will send Pacquiao into retirement and even speaking about his intention to “crucify” the Filipino legend inside the ring, a remark that irked the senator as he plans to make the undefeated American eat his words come fight night. 
 Fernandez said talking trash is Thurman’s way of dealing with his anxiety ahead of the fight. 
 “Ganoon yan kapag kinakabahan. Di ba kapag kinakabahan kang mamalengke, natataranta ka humingi ng discount sa palengke,” Fernandez said. “Pero gagawin natin lahat, wag lang mag-kumpiyansa.”

 Stanley Cup finals: In front of raucous home crowd, Blues look to rein in emotion 
 St. Louis took 10 penalties in two games in Boston and must regain its characteristic discipline. 
 Associated Press 
 ST. LOUIS — Tyler Bozak witnessed the first NHL playoff game in Toronto after a seven-year drought. David Perron experienced the first Stanley Cup finals game in Las Vegas. 
 They ain’t seen nothin’ yet. 
 GAme 3 
 WHO: Boston Bruins at St. Louis Blues 
 WHEN: 8 p.m. Saturday 
 TELEVISION: NBCSN 
 SERIES: Tied, 1-1 
 When the St. Louis Blues host the Boston Bruins in Game 3 on Saturday night, it’ll mark the first Stanley Cup finals game in the city in 49 years. The last game was May 5, 1970, when the Bruins won 6-2 to take a 2-0 lead in a series they swept on Bobby Orr’s dramatic overtime goal. 
 After winning a finals game for the first time in franchise history to tie the series at 1, the Blues are trying to make their own history at home. 
 “It’s going to be extremely special, for sure, to play in front of the Blues fans that have been waiting for it for a long time,” Perron said Friday. 
 To do so, the Blues will need to balance feeding off a raucous crowd and getting emotional in that charged atmosphere. The least-penalized team in the playoffs, St. Louis went to the box 10 times in two games in Boston, with one of those penalties putting Bruins defenseman Matt Grzelcyk into concussion protocol and leading to a Game 3 suspension for Blues forward Oskar Sundqvist. John Moore will step into Grzelcyk’s spot for Game 3. 
 “You’re trying to keep your sticks close to you so you don’t trip guys, you don’t high-stick guys and sometimes it’s just going to happen,” said Perron, a former Lewiston Maineiac. “It’s not a penalty you’re trying to take. It happened to me in the first game, and it’s very difficult to take. But you’ve got to be composed with the puck, you’ve got to be composed with your stick.” 
 Composure is the Blues’ calling card after rallying from the basement of the NHL standings in early January to within three victories of the first championship in franchise history. Their home arena was full for viewing parties for Games 1 and 2, so it’s tough for players not to get caught up in the excitement. 
 “We’re not even here and it’s sold out and it’s loud,” Bozak said. 
 Fans are certainly excited. NBC Sports reported the highest local rating on cable for a playoff game, and StubHub said the lowest price to get in is $725, and the average ticket costs $1,068. 
 “This is a hockey town and they’ve been with us through the ups and downs,” center Ryan O’Reilly said. “I don’t think I’ll be able to describe what it’s going to be like. But from what I’ve seen I’ve been very impressed, and we’re excited to get home.” 
 To show them good hockey, the Blues must try to avoid the penalty problems that plagued them in Boston. They were whistled for high-sticking, hooking, cross-checking, interference and slashing and twice for tripping and goaltender interference. 
 St. Louis got here in part because it only took 55 penalties in the first 19 playoff games. Coach Craig Berube chalks the difference up to too much emotion. 
 “We talk about that a lot,” Berube said. “You have to keep your emotions in check.”

 WASHINGTON — Exasperated by reports of a flood of illegal border crossings, President Donald Trump summoned his top immigration advisers to demand action. Responding to his mounting concern, including his extreme threats to entirely close the U.S.-Mexico border, they prepared an alternative but still-inflammatory plan to levy escalating tariffs on all Mexican imports to the United States. 
 Thursday night's surprise announcement of the plan by Trump, threatening to upend ratification chances for his own revised North American free trade pact, demonstrated the lengths to which the risk-taking president is willing to go to crack down on illegal immigration, even in the face of bipartisan criticism, legal challenges and polarized public feelings. 
 He's setting the tricky politics of immigration and trade — the two issues that defined his candidacy and bedevil his presidency — on a collision course and injecting new tensions into his relations with political allies as he struggles to show results in his campaign for a second term. 
 ""Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades,"" Trump declared anew in a tweet on Friday. That was the morning after he announced the 5% tariff would kick in on June 10 — and increase monthly to 25% ""until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied."" 
 ""Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!"" he said. 
 Debate over solutions aside, indicators at the border have indeed been getting worse. For May, officials said Thursday, apprehensions are expected to hit their highest level in more than a dozen years and ""significantly surpass the record 109,000 in April,"" said acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan. 
 On Wednesday, a group of 1,036 — including families and unaccompanied children — was appended after crossing from Juárez. That was the largest group ever apprehended at the border. 
 Nonetheless, Trump's tariff prescription for the problem was instantly panned across the political spectrum . Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a usual Trump ally and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said it was a ""misuse of presidential tariff authority"" that would burden American consumers and ""seriously jeopardize passage"" of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada pact to modify the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 ""Imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico is exactly the wrong move,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , the establishment lobbying giant that now is exploring legal action to block the tariffs. 
 ""These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border,"" Bradley said, imploring Congress and the president to work together to address border problems. 
 To both allies and critics, the tariff escalation marks the latest manifestation of Trump's increasing reliance on instinct and his aides' increasing unwillingness or inability to constrain an impulsive leader. Many of the people who had once talked Trump out of going through with his most radical ideas, such as completely shutting down the southern border or renewing the controversial immigrant child separation policy, have been pushed out of the administration, including former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. 
 The tariff announcement was made with a striking amount of secrecy for the leak-prone Trump administration, with barely two dozen officials in the West Wing aware of what was to transpire. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer and other officials with trade portfolios were not included in the final discussions Thursday and privately expressed opposition to the move, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. 
 Trump is mindful that many of his efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration have been stymied by courts or Congress, and that his promise to build a border wall will be far from fulfilled by the time voters decide his political fate next year. With his campaign depending on even more of his hard-core supporters turning out in 2020 than in 2016, Trump's team is worried that the spike in crossings could prove to be a political headache with his base. 
 But in aiming for progress on that front, Trump is now throwing into the wager another campaign promise: approval of his renegotiated North American trade pact. 
 Sandwiched between two presidential foreign trips, and with senior adviser and Mexico liaison Jared Kushner out of the country, the tariff announcement caught many in the White House and on Capitol Hill unawares. Press secretary Sarah Sanders insisted that the White House had briefed key lawmakers and allies on the plan before it was announced, though some complained they found out only at the last moment, with no time to provide feedback. 
 While the announcement was a surprise, Trump's ire over a sharp increase in southern border crossings and his demand for increasingly drastic action were not. Trump attorneys, including White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, had been studying how to fulfill the president's wish for weeks and settled on the tariff plan as a more legally-sound move than Trump's push to close the border. 
 White House officials assert that the tariff announcement was a negotiating tool, designed to get Mexico to act. And, perhaps seeking to calm anxious markets, they suggest the taxes might never take effect. 
 ""We fully believe they have the ability to stop people coming in from their southern border and if they're able to do that, these tariffs will either not go into place or will be removed after they go into place,"" said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. 
 Asked what Mexico can do to avoid the levies, press secretary Sanders said a good start would be for Mexico to send home Central American migrants crossing through their country to get into the United States. 
 ""They can return them back home,"" she said. ""They can stop these massive caravans from coming through their country into ours. That would be a very big first step.""

 COLUMBUS — Death. Taxes. Chagrin Falls girls 4x800-meter relay. 
 Amid life's certainties, the Tigers' success at state in girls 4x8 certainly appears to fit in that realm. 
 The quartet of Hannah Clark, Claire Coffey, Rose Hoelzel and Catherine Coffey captured Chagrin's fourth straight Division II state championship May 31 at Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium with a time of 9 minutes, 18.20 seconds. 
 Last week at the D-II Austintown-Fitch Regional, the Tigers ran a 9:43.95 to advance to state in girls 4x8 for the 16th time in school history. But it felt like a false positive of sorts with their deep sub-9:25 potential and a more long-term vision in mind from Chagrin distance coach Clay Burnett. 
 Hints turned to history in Columbus.

 ""That's exactly correct,"" Catherine Coffey said. ""Clay always puts us in the best positions. I know that I can always trust in him, and he got us there today."" 
 Similar to Fitch, Akron SVSM was the tone-setter early, going out hard on the first two legs to take a lead occasionally out to 50 meters. 
 Clark turned in a nice back half on her opener as she turned over to Claire Coffey, and the freshman was in third at the 400 turn of her second leg. 
 Hoelzel, also a ninth-grader, showed brilliant race sense to give the Tigers the lead for good. In the last 200 prior to the anchor exchange, the Fighting Irish third leg was visibly wearing down. Hoelzel seized upon the opportunity and hammered her homestretch to give the baton to Catherine Coffey in the lead. The reigning D-II 800 state champion torched her first 150 meters to take any doubt from the equation.

 ""Rose put us in a great position,"" Catherine Coffey said. ""And when she passed that girl, I knew we were in a good position and I could hopefully bring it home. I knew I definitely needed to make my position and make my mark, so it was definitely a goal getting out hard and keeping my position."" 
 Catherine Coffey's position is unique in Ohio, being on winning 4x8s for the Tigers all four years of her high school career. 
 And seemingly, as was the case last spring with three returning legs, the beat goes on — possibly toward a five-peat in 2020.

 ""I am definitely so blessed,"" Catherine Coffey said. ""I never thought this would ever happen. I am definitely super blessed, and it's super great this year that we have two freshmen and obviously Hannah coming back. So hopefully they can do great things in the years to come. 
 ""Just remember what we did today, and always have fun with it. It's definitely one thing I always have to remind myself of: Have fun, whatever happens. Have fun, and make memories with your teammates."" 
 Beaumont's 4x8 made another memory in its rich legacy in the event, taking fourth with a 9:27.27. Elizabeth Rubadue, Addison Ciecierski, Ashley Rulison and Mia Mlynek hung in well, with Rubadue and Ciecierski turning in gutsy legs early to stay within striking distance. Rulison hammered her first 200 to get the Blue Streaks up to fourth, and Mlynek delivered her usual strong anchor work as Beaumont notched its 20th 4x8 state top four all-time. 
 ""As always, it's a little nervewracking at the beginning because there's so many teams and everybody has at least one runner that can run like a 2:20,"" Mlynek said. ""So you're standing there and kind of waiting, and the nerves are setting in. But then I just trusted my teammates. I know that they can run consistent times and have been pretty consistent throughout the whole relay. So it eases up a little bit, and then the adrenaline takes over from the crowd and being on the track. 
 ""I think it's really cool, like with Beaumont's history, to be able to add to that and continue the tradition.""

 Active fund managers faced with dwindling liquidity and frequent blowups in individual stocks should use exchange-traded funds to navigate the market tumult, Goldman Sachs says. 
 That might be a bitter pill to swallow for stock pickers, who have been steamrolled by the rise of passive investing. But Goldman strategists led by Jessica Binder-Graham point out in a research note that some ETFs are trading in almost lockstep with their equity holdings while at the same time have much more liquidity, making them money savers in the current market environment. 
 “There is a business case that active managers could better utilize passive vehicles in the short term to help manage in and out of stock positions, particularly in periods of market volatility and stress,” the strategists wrote. “One area that seems relatively less explored is the potential to be a source of liquidity.” 
 The research is the latest from Wall Street showing how active funds can fight back in the face of the onslaught of passive vehicles. Last year, strategists at Deutsche Bank came up with a trade that they say can help investors beat equity benchmarks by building portfolios out of stocks that get whipped around the most when ETFs rebalance. 
 Passive products now account for less than 4% of the total assets managed by active funds, according to data compiled by Goldman. With the market’s ability to absorb transactions without affecting share prices stuck near multi-year lows, the benefit of employing ETFs has become something managers can’t ignore, the firm’s strategists say. 
 A Goldman measure of liquidity for single stocks has fallen 64% since mid-2017. After a brief bounce earlier this year, conditions have worsened again as the market sold off this month. Liquidity is quickly approaching the bottom seen in December, when stocks tumbled to the brink of a bear market. 
 Thin liquidity is perhaps one reason why this year’s rally hasn’t reduced the incidence of single-session wipeouts for individual stocks. As of May 2, a total of 33 S&P 500 companies suffered single-day losses greater than 10%, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. That’s virtually the same as last year, one of the worst stretches of turbulence since the financial crisis. 
 The advantage of trading ETFs versus single stocks is noticeable, according to Goldman. Over the past year, the bid-ask spread for the average ETF is roughly 40% tighter than that seen for its constituents. In other words, buying and selling ETFs tend to lead to smaller swings in prices, effectively lower costs. 
 Goldman offered an example on how the strategy might work. In December, People’s United Financial Inc. and SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (ticker KRE) were moving almost in sync, with a correlation of 0.92. Yet the average bid-ask spread averaged 2 basis points for the ETF, compared with 6.6 basis points for the lender. Meanwhile, volume in KRE was more than 10 times higher. 
 Investors who’d like to get rid of shares of People’s United could sell the equivalent exposure via the ETF and then manage out of the stock while closing the fund position without taking on significant tracking error. 
 “One could argue the KRE could be used as a more cost-effective way to synthetically get out of the PBCT position,” the strategists wrote. 
 Not all ETFs fit the bill. A lot of them don’t offer more liquidity than the underlying stocks or don’t track them closely. Below are some funds that Goldman says meet both criteria: 
 iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR) 
 Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) 
 Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) 
 VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) 
 SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP)

 WEST CHESTER TWP. — 
 A review of the preliminary autopsy report prepared by the Butler County Coroner’s Office of April’s West Chester Twp. quadruple homicide reveals an investigation in progress. 
 Despite a total of 18 gunshots suffered by the four family members cause of death remains pending. 
 By law, journalists are permitted to review preliminary report, but not take notes, record or copy. Four separate reports, much with the same information for the people found dead in the Wyndtree Drive apartment, have been prepared. Time of death was listed at about 9:15 p.m. on Sunday, April 28. 
 MORE: 4 weeks after West Chester homicides, what do we know? 
 West Chester Police were dispatched to the residence at about 9:40 p.m. by a family member who called 911, saying people were bleeding. 
 “My wife and my family are on the ground bleeding.” the male caller told dispatchers. The person is also listed on the autopsy reports as last person to see the four victims minutes or hours before the slayings. 
 Police found Hakiakat Singh Pannag, 59, and his wife, Parmjit Kaur, 62, in their apartment at 4562 Wyndtree Drive with their daughter, Shalinderjit Kaur, 39 and Parmjit Kaur’s sister, Amarjit Kaur, 58. 
 Hakiakat Singh Pannag was found in bed, head on a pillow on his left side, according to the autospy report. He has been shot in the head eight times, but the autopsy report details just six of those shots. 
 His wife, 62-year-old Parmjit Kaur, was shot four times in the head and once in the arm. She was found laying on the living room floor. 
 The other two victims were also found in the living room and appeared to be dressed in night clothes. Shalinderjit Kaur was shot three times in the head. Amarjit Kaur, who was visiting from India, was shot twice in the head.

 Police have said one of the victims appeared to have been preparing food at the time of the homicide. It was burning on the stove when officers arrived. 
 A sheet of thumbnail photos of the crime scene and victims were also part of the file. While difficult to see, the photos show devastating scene of where four people died violently. 
 In the weeks since the deaths, which are classified as homicides by the coroner’s office, police have searched the residence and another nearby. A pond behind the apartment building was searched with boats and divers. 
 The search warrants have been returned to the Butler County Clerk of Courts Office and ordered sealed by a judge, according to Mary Swain, county clerk of courts. 
 There have been no updates from police, but Chief Joel Herzog has said the homicide are not hate crime, though the shootings were not a random act.

 By Benjamin Fulford 
 The dismantling of the Khazarian mafia control grid continues with ongoing takedown of the leadership of Saudi Israelia, say Pentagon, CIA, and other sources.  In particular, negotiations are now taking place between Russia and the U.S. to divide Saudi Arabia into a Sunni zone controlled by Iran and a Shia zone controlled by Turkey, according to CIA and FSB sources. 
 Here is what the Pentagon had to say on this:  “Karma’s a bitch, as Saudi Arabia may be dismembered for what it did to Jamal Khashoggi, and Mohammed bone Sawman (MBS) may be forced to end the Yemen war and lift the Qatar blockade, while the U.S. may find new partners in Turkey and Iran after the Global Currency Reset.” 
 The other thing going on is that the long-awaited arrests of cabalists in the U.S. have already begun, the sources say.  The highest-profile of these are senior Goldman Sachs bankers arrested along with former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak for looting money from that country.  One of the uses for the stolen money was to finance the Rothschild-glorifying film “The Wolf of Wall Street.” 
 https://www.npr.org/2018/11/01/663197943/2-goldman-sachs-bankers-charged-in-malaysian-financial-scandal 
 More of the over 61,000 sealed indictments will be unsealed after the U.S. midterm elections, but already, “Gitmo Air is wheels up,” the Pentagon sources say. 
 Another visible aspect of this is the cabal (Rockefeller faction) General Electric Corporation’s ongoing bankruptcy, the sources say.  This writer’s great-grandfather George Taylor Fulford was the largest single shareholder in GE before he died in a mysterious car crash in 1905.  All newspaper archives related to this crash have vanished, but his GE shares all went to the Rockefeller family via a corrupt trust fund, according to my grandmother.  So for me, this is poetic justice more than a century after the fact.  It is also important to remember that GE was intimately involved in the March 11, 2011 nuclear and tsunami mass-murder attack on Japan, since it was their nuclear generators that were supposedly at the heart of this crime. 
 In any case, the ongoing slow-motion stock market collapse will continue to claim corporate victims as the new Quantum Financial System goes online, the Pentagon sources say. 
 The sources also say,“ The migrant caravan [in Mexico] may have been neutralized with 15,000 U.S. troops to the border, as ISIS [Daesh], MS13, and other criminal elements were arrested by Special Forces, while Mexico has induced many to seek asylum.”  In other words, attempts to use this caravan to disrupt the U.S. midterm elections have been neutralized. 
 There is also high-level intrigue going on in East Asia with the remote-controlled hijacking and crashing of Indonesian Lion Air Flight JT610, CIA sources say.  This plane crash was part of a proxy battle for control of the …

 Former FBI Director James Comey sharply criticized Attorney General William Barr's Friday appearance on CBS, saying that he'd failed to act responsibly as attorney general. 
 ""Bill Barr on CBS offers no facts. An AG should not be echoing conspiracy theories. He should gather facts and show them. That is what Justice is about,"" Comey, the onetime FBI director, tweeted on Saturday. 
 While it's unclear exactly which comments Comey was referring to, Barr reportedly told CBS that the Justice Department had made a mistake in the way it carried out the Russia investigation. 
 ""I think the activities were undertaken by a small group at the top which is one of the ... probably one of the mistakes that has been made instead of running this as a normal bureau investigation or counterintelligence investigation. It was done by the executives at the senior level, out of headquarters,"" he said .

 This wasn't the first time Comey attacked Barr. In May, he called out the attorney general for ""sliming his own department.""

 Published Jun 1, 2019, 1:29 am IST 
 Updated Jun 1, 2019, 1:32 am IST 
 Telangana gets ready to press for monitoring of telemetry systems. 
 The Telangana state government wants to fix more telemetry systems on the Krishna to monitor drawing of water by AP. Sharing of Krishna water between Telangana and Rayalaseema could become a sore point. Telemetry systems have been placed at Muchumarri and Pothi-reddypadu head regulator. (Representational Image) 
 Kurnool: The bonhomie between Chief Ministers Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and K. Chandrasekhar Rao is being viewed by farmers and leaders with trepidation as they feel that Telangana state wants AP to use more of Godavari water than dip into the river Krishna. 
 This could affect farmers in Rayalaseema, said Mr Byreddy Rajasekhar Reddy, who is fighting for farmers’ issues. “We don’t have water to drink, forget about irrigation needs. There is no green grass for our cattle which has led to mass transport of cattle to abbatoirs. Groundwater levels have plummeted.” 
  
 He said what was required now was an urgent solution to Krishna water issue than utilisation of Godavari water. 
 The Telangana state government wants to fix more telemetry systems on the Krishna to monitor drawing of water by AP. Sharing of Krishna water between Telangana and Rayalaseema could become a sore point. Telemetry systems have been placed at Muchumarri and Pothi-reddypadu head regulator. 
 Seema farmers are agitating against snooping on water utilization. The Telangana state government has for long been alleging that AP was drawing water without authorisation from the Srisailam dam via the Pothireddy-padu head regulator. 
 Mr Rajasekhar Reddy said the efficacy of telemetry systems was questionable and they did not have a positive outcome anywhere in the country/ 
 He said that Telangana had been telling Krishna Water Tribunal that about 351 tmc ft of water from the Krishna basin was being transferred, as per statistics provided by the AP government, to command area fed by projects that are not part of the basin. The claim that Potireddypadu, Galeru-Nagari and Handri-Neeva are diverting water to non-basin areas is a patent lie, he said. 
 The TS government contends that the entire command area of the Nagarjunasagar Right Canal and even part of the Krishna delta is not part of the Krishna basin, he said. 
 Mr Rajasekhar Reddy sought to know how AP Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy would protect the interests of Rayalaseema. “It is appreciable that the two Chief Ministers are walking shoulder to shoulder. Let that work for the benefit of Rayalaseema from where Mr Jagan Mohan Reddy hails,” he said.

 Today, I didn’t ruin someone’s life. 
 I’m an employee at Safeway and this morning I walked into the bathroom before starting my shift. The first thing I see is someone has left their wallet! I open it, out of curiosity of course, to find a cashiers envelope filled with $100 bills. I wanted to take it, I really did. But I have come a long way in the past couple years and decided I would return it to the front desk. Money, credit cards and all. As I’m walking out the young lady who left it was historical and asking if I’d seen it. I hand it over without so much as a “thank you for not stealing my shit” from this woman.  I then thought to myself I should have taken it. But I feel like I’ve taken a huge step today returning the wallet and everything in it. I really could have used the money, but the feeling of knowing I did the right and moral thing today makes me feel accomplished and proud of where I am in life today.

 Back to Gallery 
 YORKTOWN, Va. (AP) — In suburban Philadelphia, it took a little more than eight minutes into the question-and-answer session at freshman Rep. Madeleine Dean's town hall before someone asked about impeachment. 
 The topic was broached in Southern California as Rep. Katie Porter fielded other questions on health care, homelessness, border security and the minimum wage. 
 In military heavy Yorktown, along coastal Virginia, another newly elected Democrat, Rep. Elaine Luria, never got asked about it at all. 
 Since House Democrats swept to power last November, the seams of their big tent majority are being stretched over the difficult issues surrounding whether to start impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. 
 For those lawmakers and others, the town hall sessions in their districts revealed how much or how little impeachment is on voters' minds. Lawmakers were at home the same week that special counsel Robert Mueller delivered his first and potentially last public statement on the matter. 
 The differing opinions expressed to lawmakers offer a snapshot of the challenges facing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the many conversations to come. 
 ""I actually wondered whether anybody would bring it up,"" Dean told the crowd of about 150 in a Montgomery County Community College auditorium. 
 It was Wednesday, the night after Mueller's rare public remarks. Dean drew applause and whistles and hoots of support as she laced into Trump, calling him ""the most indecent president of our lifetime."" 
 Dean serves on the House Judiciary Committee, which is steeped in the impeachment debate, and she is among those calling for an impeachment inquiry. But the new congresswoman also acknowledged that in other conversations with voters around the district recently, they did not raise the subject. 
 The night before Mueller's spoke at the Justice Department, Luria said she, too, was only asked about impeachment at one of her three stops Tuesday, during a visit with seniors at a retirement community. 
 The former Naval officer, who is also new to Congress, said it came up as more of a question, asking what she makes of it all. 
 ""I talked about how I think Congress has an important duty, oversight, and we have a big responsibility to get to the bottom of the facts,"" she recalled in an interview later that evening after the town hall in Yorktown. 
 Luria said she also brought the question back to the seniors for their advice. ""I wasn't alive when Watergate happened ... I understand it was very divisive as a country,"" she recalled telling them, ""and kind of asked them, 'How do you feel about it?'"" 
 The seniors nodded in agreement, she said, responding, ""Yes, it's something that would be very divisive."" 
 These are the considerations Pelosi is taking into account as she considers the House's next moves. Despite increasingly vocal voices among her colleagues for the start of an impeachment inquiry, Pelosi has made it clear she's in no rush to impeach. Such proceedings would start in the House before the case would shift to the Senate for a trial. 
 Pelosi prefers a more measured approach, saying she wants to have the country's support, whatever the House's ultimate decision. 
 Democrats last year won the majority in so many districts that had voted for Trump in 2016, basing their campaigns on promises of lowering health care costs, creating jobs with infrastructure investment and cleaning up the government. So Pelosi is wary of taking on an impeachment inquiry that would overpower that agenda. 
 Pelosi worries impeachment would split the country. She remembers how the proceedings against President Bill Clinton helped propel Democrats, and warns it could help Trump's re-election in 2020. 
 But that might not be enough for some voters. 
 About 15 people waited at a library in Memphis to meet with Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat who was one of the earliest House proponents of impeachment 
 One constituent, Lloyd Brown, 62, told The Associated Press that he is watching the impeachment process closely. 
 ""I do think that Congress should proceed with impeachment hearings, because I believe that will bring out some of the facts that haven't become public yet,"" Brown said. 
 Cohen, also a member of the House Judiciary Committee, discussed the possibility of impeachment, expressing his hope that Mueller will testify before the House. The congressman said that even if Trump is impeached, he does not think that the president will be convicted in the Republican-controlled Senate. 
 ""But I do think he should have his day of reckoning,"" Cohen said, adding later that Trump ""makes Richard Nixon look honest."" 
 At a town hall in western Michigan on Tuesday, a woman told Rep. Justin Amash, the only Republican to accuse Trump of impeachable conduct, that she has been calling Pelosi's office nearly every day because ""we need to change her mind"" about an impeachment inquiry. 
 Amash agreed it's time to start an inquiry. But Amash, who has drawn criticism from his party, said Pelosi's ""sort of playing it both ways."" 
 On Thursday, about 100 people packed into a small room at a library in Tustin, California, as Porter spoke briefly then drew from random questions attendants had written down on cards. 
 They covered various topics including one about what should happen to those who refuse to appear for testimony before a congressional committee, leading Porter to briefly address the issue of impeachment. 
 The new congresswoman from what had been a Republican-held district told the crowd her goal is to do her job, not stoke a crisis. But she said the refusal to comply with the subpoenas was a turning point, in her view. 
 ""You didn't hear me ever talk about impeachment. It's not why I went to Washington,"" she said. ""But I will not shirk my duty if the time comes, and the time is nigh."" 
 After the event, Barbara Colter, 66, said the last time she saw Porter speak the congresswoman didn't seem to want to move in that direction. But her comments on Thursday made Colter think that's changed. And she agrees. 
 ""After yesterday, I think that we need to move in that direction,"" Colter said.

 The Associated Press 
 SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)  A fire engulfed a migrant center in northwestern Bosnia on Saturday, injuring 32 people and forcing some to jump out the windows to escape the blaze, police said. 
 The blaze erupted early in the morning in the center in Velika Kladusa, which hosts some 500 migrants who have become stuck in the impoverished Balkan country while trying to move toward wealthier nations in Western Europe. 
 The blaze likely started accidently from a cooking device, said local police spokesman Ale Siljdedic. 
 It spread swiftly, sending the migrants fleeing the building, with some jumping to safety out the windows, Siljdedic told The Associated Press. 
 Thirteen migrants remain hospitalized with injuries such as burns or fractures, he said. The fire was put out after several hours. 
 Several thousand migrants fleeing war and poverty in their countries have been passing through Bosnia toward the West. They mostly flock to the northwest, which borders European Union member Croatia.",1
26831,"Movie Productions In Georgia May Stop Over State's Abortion Law 
 By Neda Ulaby 
 Morning Edition,  · Entertainment companies say they may not do business in Georgia if a restrictive abortion law takes effect. In 2016, Georgia overtook California as the state with the most feature films produced. 
 Transcript 
 RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: 
 More feature films are made in Georgia than in any other U.S. state. Its film commission even likes to call Georgia Y'allywood. But a restrictive abortion law passed earlier this spring is threatening that industry. Ten major film and TV studios now say they might halt production altogether there. 
 NPR's Neda Ulaby reports. 
 NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: It started with Netflix. 
 (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) 
 ULABY: Some of its most popular shows are filmed in Georgia, including the science fiction hit, ""Stranger Things,"" starting its third season this summer. 
 (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""STRANGER THINGS"") 
 DAVID HARBOUR: (As Chief Hopper) It is important to me that you feel safe. 
 ULABY: Ted Sarandos, who runs Netflix studios, said on Tuesday the Georgia law would restrict the rights of his female employees. And if it's enacted, his company would reconsider shooting there. The next day, Disney CEO Bob Iger made a similar comment in an interview with Reuters. 
 (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) 
 BOB IGER: Well, I think if it becomes law, it will be very difficult to produce there. I rather doubt we will. I think many people who work for us will not want to work there. And we'll have to heed their wishes in that regard. 
 (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""BLACK PANTHER"") 
 CHADWICK BOSEMAN: (As Black Panther) Wakanda forever. 
 ULABY: ""Black Panther"" and ""Avengers: Endgame"" are just two Disney blockbusters that were shot partly in Georgia. Disney and other companies have faced pressure from abortion rights advocates to stop filming there, including from top directors and stars. 
 RODNEY HO: They want to be supportive of their creatives. 
 ULABY: Rodney Ho covers entertainment for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He says in spite of Georgia's generous tax credits, studios like Disney and Netflix still depend on those big name producers and talent to make their movies and shows. 
 HO: And if they refuse to work in Georgia, it's like, you know, what can Disney or Netflix or these guys do? 
 ULABY: Film and TV studios bring an estimated $9 1/2 billion to the state, as well as nearly 100,000 jobs. A Hollywood boycott, says Ho, would leave local workers behind. 
 HO: You know, the hair people, the prop people - all the people who moved here and built businesses here, they don't get any of the tax credits. So they would just simply, you know, lose all the money from all the investment they put in on the assumption that this tax credit would be around and nothing could possibly hurt it. 
 ULABY: That said, a number of studios, including Disney, threatened to leave Georgia two years ago when a bill passed that would have allowed religious groups to discriminate against queer and transgender people. Then-Governor Nathan Deal vetoed it. But Ho says Georgia's governor now, Brian Kemp, made this abortion bill a campaign promise. 
 HO: So he's simply saying he's doing what he's doing for his constituents. So that's where we're at right now. 
 ULABY: Ho points out that similarly restrictive bills have been blocked in other states, and Georgia's is being challenged as well. The major studios may be counting on not having to make a real decision.

 Brewing a career in this niche field will help you set up your own business or become an expert 
 Each of us have our own passions and dreams. While some dream of becoming an astronaut, others dream of becoming a hair-stylist. Everyone’s dreams depend on the skills and talent they possess. One such talent that has not yet been explored much, is the art of brewing. 
 It is often said that brewing is an art and science. The study of this craft is not too popular at the moment. However, considering the growth of the industry (especially small breweries) and beer as a beverage, universities are now offering certified courses on brewing. 
 Modules 
 In these courses, you will start by learning the basics, which will include theory about its history, overview of the brewing process and current happenings in the industry. You will also be taught about the fundamentals of the equipment, processes and brewery operations. Future brewers will be made aware about the quality and safety requirements in the industry. Students get to study theory as well as practical modules, which allow them to learn the craft while making industry connections. 
 Eligibility 
 Universities do not ask for any academic qualifications to join these courses. However, some institutes conduct an interview to test candidates’ prior knowledge. In such cases, candidates are expected to know the basics of brewing, or at least showcase their interest in this field. Foreign universities ask for minimum English language skills with IELTS or TOEFL score of 5.5, with no band score lower than 5.0. This varies from institute to institute. The courses are only made available to students who are above 18 years. 
 Universities 
 New Zealand’s University of Otago’s Polytechnic clinic offers a similar Level-4 course for students with a passion for brewing. The university has now announced a scholarship too, which will be awarded to two students each year. They will be given a place at the New World Beer and Cider Awards judging tables. The scholarship allows them to learn the skills of beer judging from experts and will cover their travelling and accommodation costs. 
 In addition to theoretical knowledge, selected students will also get a chance to gain practical knowledge at Rough Rock Brewing Co, the brand-new commercial brewery-come-classroom at Bannockburn, Central Otago. 
 There are also other universities such as SRM University, Chennai, Oregon State University, the U.S, and so on, that offer diploma, certified courses and full-time degrees in brewing.

 Board of Regents Meets to Discuss Deadly Virus Outbreak 
 The University System of Maryland's Board of Regents held a special meeting Friday to discuss the deadly virus outbreak that killed a college student. The meeting comes on the heels of Maryland Governor Larry Hogan calling for an investigation. News4's Darcy Spencer reports. 
 (Published Friday, May 31, 2019) 
 The University System of Maryland’s Board of Regents held a closed meeting Friday to discuss an investigation into the deadly virus outbreak that killed an 18-year-old University of Maryland student last fall. 
 The meeting comes a day after Maryland Governor Larry Hogan called for an immediate probe into the way the school responded to the circumstances surrounding 18-year-old Olivia Paregol’s death from adenovirus. 
 Paregol, a freshman at the University, contracted the virus and died in November 2018. Within a month, 35 cases of adenovirus were reported at the university. 
 In a statement Friday, chair Linda Gooden said the board agreed with the governor’s request for a review and that in their meeting, via private conference call,  they would discuss their options to make sure that a “thorough, independent and transparent investigation of the work” President Loh and his team have done takes place. 
 Family Lays Groundwork for Lawsuit Over UMD Student's Death 
 After the Board's message, Michael Ricci, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement that Hogan believes the Board of Regents “is the appropriate body to conduct this review”. 
 “This is certainly a step in the right direction towards getting answers for the Paregol family and the UMD community”, he said. 
 Olivia’s father, Ian Paragol, told News4’s Darcy Spencer that he wants to make sure the investigation is independent, and that he believes the university needed to let the campus community know there was an outbreak sooner. He said the school knew about the virus outbreak for 18 days before reporting it. 
 Adenovirus Cases Up to 35 at University of Maryland 
 “We just want to make sure no one else suffers”, he said. “Communication is proper and truthful”. 
 Olivia had a weakened immune system due to having Crohns disease. Previously, her dad questioned whether mold in the dorms may have contributed to her death , although the head of the campus health center said there's no ""consistent connection"" between mold and the virus. 
 “She went to the health center after they knew”, he said. “We hold the university and the President responsible.” 
 The family filed a notice of claim under the Maryland Tort Claims Act last week, laying the groundwork for a possible lawsuit against the school.",1

 A Tottenham season ticket holder and three members of his family endured a two-day journey across the continent in a hatchback car after being put off by sky-high airfares between the UK and Madrid for the Champions League final. 
 Kieran Knight, 24, set off with father Mark, and brothers Rhys and Marcus, from Billericay in Essex at 5am on Thursday, arriving in Madrid around 36 hours later after stopping overnight in the French resort of Biarritz. 
 The quartet missed their initial slot on the Eurotunnel, then endured further delays when one of the cars in front of them suffered a flat battery as they arrived in France. 
 But the Spurs fan is confident the 1,000-mile journey in the Volkswagen Golf GTI Sport was worth it – and said he would not sell his ticket, bought at face value, at any price. 
 Describing his route to Madrid as he arrived in the Spanish capital ahead of Tottenham’s Champions League final match with Liverpool, Mr Knight told the Press Association: “It’s been quite a long one. 
 “We were supposed to be on the Eurotunnel at 6.50am, but stupidly we didn’t research it and we got there five minutes to departure so realised we couldn’t get on that one. 
 Spurs fan Kieran Knight, who travelled for 36 hours to get to Madrid (Ryan Hooper/PA) 
 “The train then broke down in the tunnel so we were delayed an hour – in a train, no alcohol, no signal, it was quite boring. 
 “We arrived in France at about 8am French time and the battery broke down (on a car in front) so they eventually had to get pushed off. 
 “We had a 10-hour journey, we stopped in Biarritz, about 500 miles, which was a long way. 
 “We woke up Friday morning, had a dip in the sea, and left at 9am. It took a bit longer than we expected. 
 “We had a very dodgy potato omelette baguette, which as you can imagine was disgusting. We had some beer, some good chats, and arrived here at 4pm. 
 “We arrived a day before the game, and we are enjoying it.”

 Soybeans: China’s main weapon in Trump’s trade war 
 Ian Sheldon/The Conversation 
 Soybean farmers displays handfuls of his crop. 
 The Conversation 
 Soybeans may not seem all that useful in a war. Nonetheless they’ve become China’s most important weapon in its ever-worsening trade conflict with the U.S. 
 China, the world’s biggest soybeans buyer, has reportedly stopped purchasing any from U.S. markets in retaliation for the Trump administration raising tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods. This is bad news for American farmers. 
 While China’s targeting of soybeans may have come as something of a surprise, to agricultural economists who study international commodity markets for a living, this was not at all unexpected. 
 Even before the conclusion of the 2016 presidential race, trade analysts were already weighing the possibility that China might impose an embargo on U.S. soybean imports based on protectionist rhetoric. 
 Soybeans are a crucial part of the global food chain, particularly as a source of protein in the production of hogs and poultry. 
 With the trade war in full swing, American soybean farmers are now among its biggest losers. 
 The importance of China as a market for soybeans has been driven by an explosion in demand for meat as consumers switch from a diet dominated by rice to one where pork, poultry and beef play an important part. 
 Chinese production of meat from those three animals surged 250% from 1986 to 2012 and is projected to increase another 30% by the end of the current decade. However, China is unable to produce enough animal feed itself, hence the need to import soybeans from the United States and Brazil. 
 In 2017, the U.S. accounted for $21.4 billion worth of global soybean exports, the second largest after its main competitor Brazil, which exported $25.7 billion. 
 Meanwhile, in 2017 China accounted for the lion’s share of global soybean imports at $39.6 billion, or two-thirds of the total. 
 Back in 2017, that was good news for American farmers, when U.S. exports made up about a third of Chinese purchases, or $13.9 billion. That made soybeans the United States’ second-most valuable export to China after airplanes. 
 But U.S. exports to China have fallen dramatically since China slapped a 25% tariff on Americans soybeans last April as part of its initial response to President Donald Trump’s trade war. 
 In the current farm marketing year, which began Sept. 1, U.S. farmers have exported just 5.9 million metric tons of soybeans to China, compared with an average of 29 million at the same point during the previous three years – or about 80% less. 
 That’s why the tariffs have tremendous potential to hurt farmers in my state of Ohio, where soybeans were the number one agricultural export in 2017 at $1.3 billion. China is the state’s largest export market. 
 Yet nationally, Ohio is just the seventh-largest exporter of soybeans, after Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Indiana and Missouri, all of which are suffering from the tariffs. 
 Not only do farmers stand to lose out by giving up market share to Brazilian farmers, but soybean prices at the port of New Orleans have fallen as well and are currently $9.35 a bushel compared with $10.82 per bushel a year ago. This has hurt incomes and created a double whammy for Midwest farms. 
 This is of course why the Chinese chose to place a tariff on U.S. soybeans in the first place. Farmers will hurt a lot, and soybeans are produced in states where many of them voted for Trump. 
 China’s hope, presumably, is that farmers will lobby the administration to step back from further escalation of the trade war. 
 That seems unlikely, given the $28 billion in aid the Trump administration is offering farmers to soften the blow and the possibility of higher tariffs on an additional $325 billion worth of Chinese imports. 
 At this point it looks like both sides are hunkering down for a prolonged trade war.

3665,"Advocates decry delays in release of migrant kids 
 By ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON and AMY TAXIN | Associated Press 
 Email 
 MIAMI – Immigrant advocates say the federal government is allowing migrant children at a Florida facility to languish in ""prison-like conditions"" instead of releasing them promptly to family. 
 Attorneys filed hundreds of pages in federal court in Los Angeles Friday asking a judge to make the U.S. government honor a decades-old settlement agreement governing the care of detained immigrant children. 
 Advocates said children who are held at the Homestead, Florida facility after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to sponsors or licensed facilities within 20 days. 
 In court filings, teens said they longed to be released and complained they were given the same food daily, limited phone calls and told to heed the rules or it could prolong their detention or get them deported.

 NDP’s $15-billion climate plan greeted with mixed reviews 
 By Alex Ballingall Ottawa Bureau 
 Fri., May 31, 2019 
 OTTAWA—The race for climate credibility in Canadian politics rumbled along Friday as politicians and advocacy groups judged the NDP’s new, $15-billion environment platform that promises to slash emissions beyond Canada’s current target and create at least 300,000 jobs. 
 Green Leader Elizabeth May welcomed the pre-election jockeying for who has the best plan to fight climate change, but said the NDP’s is too vague and unambitious. She questioned why it doesn’t name a specific emissions target — the NDP says it would pass legislation to enshrine a target consistent with global scientific demands to avoid climate catastrophe — and said the Green party’s plan would accomplish goals like the removal of fossil fuels from Canada’s electric grid and making energy-efficient retrofits to all buildings in the country faster than the NDP. 
 “Don’t tell me you’re going to be climate leaders until I see what you think you’re prepared to do,” May told the Star by phone on Friday. 
 “If it’s not in writing, and it’s not clear, then it becomes a campaign promise that you can walk away from.” 
 At a partisan rally in Montreal Friday morning, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said his party’s plan is the “most comprehensive” environmental platform it has ever proposed, a 22-page document that outlines measures New Democrats would take to tackle climate change and economic inequality at the same time. The NDP promises to spend billions on public transit, tax rebates to encourage people to buy zero-emissions vehicles that are made in Canada, and the creation of a new “Canadian Climate Bank” that would use federal money to support green technology and low-carbon initiatives. 
 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW 
 The NDP would ban single-use plastics by 2022, and make energy-efficient retrofits on all houses in Canada by 2050. 
 The party claims its plan would create at least 300,000 jobs in the first mandate of an NDP government, and put Canada on track to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 38 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, which is beyond Canada’s current target under the Paris Agreement — set by the former Conservative government and kept by the Liberals — to slash emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by that year. 
 In a public statement Friday, Greenpeace activists lauded the NDP plan for recognizing Canada needs to ramp up efforts to slash emissions if it is to help the world meet the Paris Agreement goal of restricting global warming below 1.5 degrees C. Greenpeace said the NDP’s pledge to conserve 30 per cent of Canada’s lands and waters by 2030 “sets the standard” all parties should strive for, and applauded the promise to ban single-use plastics. 
 The United Steelworkers union also welcomed measures for workers in the NDP plan, including proposals to help people who work in fossil fuel industries receive training for jobs in new sectors as the world shifts away from energy sources that emit greenhouse gas. 
 Meanwhile, on Parliament Hill, federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna was underwhelmed. She accused Singh of dropping his support for liquefied natural gas development in B.C. — Singh was criticized by some labour leaders in mid-May after he said he can’t support certain developments backed by the NDP government in B.C. — and said the NDP’s climate plan will actually hurt the economy, not grow it. 
 McKenna’s office later released a chart comparing NDP proposals with measures the Liberals have already taken in government, including the creation of $5,000 rebates for people who buy zero-emission vehicles and $185 million earmarked for workers transitioning out of fossil fuel industries. 
 But McKenna also zeroed in on how the NDP plans to change the federal government’s minimum price on carbon emissions, which was imposed in four provinces this year and is set to be imposed in Alberta — Canada’s heaviest emitter — now that Premier Jason Kenney scrapped the province’s own carbon tax. The NDP says it would change how the carbon price applies to heavy polluters so they pay more for their emissions. 
 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW 
 This part of the carbon price sets thresholds for specific industries based on the average emissions per unit of production in their sector. Businesses that emit less than the average earn credits they can sell, and those that emit more either buy credits or pay the carbon price on their excess emissions. 
 The NDP wants to lower these thresholds so businesses pay more, and eliminate the more generous thresholds for businesses with intense international competition that can’t easily slash emissions, like cement and lime producers. 
 McKenna suggested these changes would be bad for the economy, because the performance standard thresholds are designed to protect Canadian businesses from losing ground to companies in other countries that don’t have to pay carbon prices. 
 “We need to be making sure that we have Canadian companies that are competing against companies around the world, that we create incentives for them to be best in class, but also to be competitive,” she said, adding that the federal Conservatives still haven’t said how they would tackle climate change without any carbon price. 
 “The NDP, what they are proposing is as bad for the economy as what the Conservatives are proposing is for the environment,” she said. 
 In a statement, Chris Ragan, chair of the pro-carbon price Ecofiscal Commission, said the NDP’s proposal to increase the carbon price for heavy emitters could risk doing nothing for the environment, because instead of investing to lower emissions, companies could calculate it makes more sense just to shift production out of the country. 
 “This would hurt the Canadian economy and would not help global emissions,” he said.

82176,"Telangana Board declared 3.28 lakh as having failed in 1 subject or other 
 26 students committed suicide after large-scale irregularities 
 After re-evaluation, it was found 1,137 students actually passed 
 Hours after declaring high school student Anamika Arutla had in fact passed her Telugu exam by scoring 48 marks as opposed to the 20 originally awarded, the Telangana Board of Intermediate Examination (BIE) claimed a ""clerical error"" meant her re-evaluated mark was actually only 21. 
 None of this matters to Anamika though, who was one of 26 students who committed suicide after large-scale irregularities in their exams; she killed herself on the day results were declared. Over three lakh students were declared to have failed, prompting widespread outcry that went all the way to the High Court and led to a mandated re-evaluation of those scripts. 
 ""I think this is not a suicide by her. This is surely a murder by the government. This is a mistake of the government and Globearena and intermediate board,"" her distraught sister told NDTV. 
 A marksheet showing the first revision of Anamika's marks - from 20 to 48 
 The BIE had declared results of the intermediate exams (for 11th and 12th standards) on April 18. 
 It soon found itself fiercely criticised by students and parents for widespread anomalies, some of which were quite extreme; one student's mark sheet showed 00 in Telugu but after a recount, it became 99 . 
 Of the 9.7 lakh students who took the exam, the system declared 3.28 lakh as having failed in one subject or the other. But after re-evaluation, it was found that 1,137 students had actually passed their respective exams. 
 ""Once they said this is not our mistake. It is the students' mistake. 'They did not study well'. But clearly whose mistake is now shown. Obviously this mistake is by the government only,"" Anamika's sister Udaya said. 
 Anamika's sister told NDTV that the state government was to blame for her death. 
 ""The board kept saying 26 students who committed suicide didn't pass. But what is this? Government murdered these children. How much agony is the family going through,"" activist Sudhakar told NDTV. 
 A state government probe pointed to the alleged inability of Globarena Technologies Pvt Ltd to handle the massive amount of data for holding the exam. 
 Analysts and opposition leaders have alleged that the tender criterion about capacity and experience in dealing with the answer sheets of 9.78 lakh students was allegedly relaxed or waived. 
 The probe report also claimed  ""no significant variation has been observed in the pass percentage of 2019 when compared with 2018"". 
 The results row has also taken a political turn with opposition parties accusing Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, or KCR as he is popularly known, of inaction. 
 ""We are demanding a judicial probe into this. This is a huge scam. The company that was given the contact for end-to-end technical support was simply not qualified to handle the future of 9.7 lakh children,"" BJP Telangana chief K Laxman told NDTV. 
 The Congress also wrote to KCR demanding suspension of the BIE secretary over ""callous and corrupt practices"" and that the Chief Minister award Rs 25 lakh to families of the students who committed suicide.

 PEORIA -- The Harvest Christian Academy baseball team was not going to go away quietly in the Class 1A state semifinal on Friday. Senior catcher Jack Nohava was going to make sure of that. 
 But in the end, after scoring all their runs in the final three innings and Nohava's 7 RBI, the Lions were not able to erase an early deficit in a 10-8 loss to Ottawa Marquette. 
 ""We faced adversity all year and these boys never quit so there was little doubt we were going to get going,"" Harvest Christian coach Matt Ellett said. ""It was one of those days we ran out of innings. If we play a nine-inning ballgame there, it's a different outcome."" 
 Harvest Christian (24-4) will play Steeleville in the Class 1A third-place game at 9 a.m. Saturday. 
 Nohava's seven runs driven in on Friday matched the state tournament single-game record. His grand slam in the sixth cut the deficit to 8-6. 
 ""He wasn't throwing super-fast and his off-speed was recognizable,"" Nohava said. ""I went up there looking fastball and could adjust to the off-speed. I went up there hacking."" 
 Marquette added much-needed insurance runs on a sacrifice fly by Logan Komater and an RBI infield single by Jack Snook in the top of the seventh. 
 Nohava drove in the game's final two runs with a two-out, two-run single in the bottom of the inning. 
 ""You have to give that team a heck of a lot of credit. They were down 8-0 and didn't quit,"" Marquette coach Todd Hopkins said. ""I was not comfortable in that last inning."" 
 The Crusaders (32-2) took that lead with a combination of small-ball on offense and timely pitching and key defensive plays. 
 They pushed across the game's first run with a swinging-bunt single by Luke Couch, who then went from first to third on a wild pitch, a suicide squeeze bunt by Komater, which the three-hole hitter turned into a single. 
 Komater scored on a double by Snook. Marquette also scored twice in the third, three times in the fourth and a single run in the fifth all the while keeping the Lions at bay. 
 Harvest Christian had runners in scoring position in every inning but one. In the third, HCA had the bases loaded and no outs but Nohava's screaming liner down the first-base line was snagged by diving first baseman Hayden Price, who only had to reach over and tag first for an easy double play. 
 The catch kept Nohava from breaking the all-class RBI record. 
 ""He pounds the baseball,"" Ellett said. ""I get scared coaching third knowing that a rocket could be coming at me. That's the guy I want up with the bases loaded. It's a shame it was in a losing effort."" 
 The hard-hit balls, even though not all of them fell for hits early, has Harvest Christian optimistic for Saturday's season finale. 
 ""We never really stopped hitting the baseball, really,"" said junior Gil Duran, who went 3-for-5 with three runs scored. ""Everybody came alive, so (today) it will just carry over."" 
 Said Nohava: ""We're blessed to have another day to go out and have some fun.""

 ST. LOUIS (AP) — John Moore is ready for his closeup and the chance to make an impact in the Stanley Cup Final. 
 Moore is expected to replace injured defenseman Matt Grzelcyk in the Boston Bruins' lineup for Game 3 at the St. Louis Blues tonight. Grzelcyk is in concussion protocol and didn't travel with the team, and Moore took his place in practice Friday alongside Connor Clifton. 
 ""This is why you train, why you prepare, why you take care of yourself,"" Moore said. ""When you're called upon, it's time to do your job."" 
 The series is tied at 1. 
 Moore for Grzelcyk is one of a couple holes being filled with injuries and a suspension affecting the plans for coaches Bruce Cassidy of the Bruins and Craig Berube of the Blues. Boston first-line center Patrice Bergeron and Blues first-line winger Vladimir Tarasenko are confirmed to play in Game 3 after each one missed practice for maintenance, but the lineups have to change slightly. 
 The Blues will be without important grinder Oskar Sundqvist after their only active player with a Cup ring was suspended one game for boarding Grzelcyk and knocking him out of Game 2 on Wednesday night. Zach Sanford is expected to go in the lineup for his first playoff action since the first round, though Berube wouldn't confirm that and said injured forward Robert Thomas was a ""possibility"" to play. 
 Neither one can replicate exactly what Sundqvist does for St. Louis. 
 ""Does a lot of good things for us on both sides of the puck,"" Berube said. ""Good penalty killer, center, wing, great defensively and has produced for us, too. Good player."" 
 Sanford hasn't played since Game 3 of the Winnipeg series April 14. That's an even longer layoff than Blues winger Robby Fabbri, who replaced Thomas in Game 2. 
 ""The guys who haven't been playing have done a good job of holding each other accountable,"" Sanford said. ""We've been skating, working out. It's a little different when you get into a game."" 
 Moore knows all about this stage after playing for the New York Rangers in the 2014 Cup Final against Los Angeles. 
 ""It's definitely one of those things you can take a deep breath, make sure you're focused,"" Moore said. ""There are a lot of distractions at this stage of the playoffs. If anything, I feel I'm more mature to handle that and be focused on my job.""",1

 Washington and Beijing resumed their trade battle last month when trade talks in the US ended without a deal.

 Beijing: China on Saturday increased tariffs on billions worth of US goods as it prepares to unveil a blacklist of ""unreliable"" foreign companies that analysts say aims to punish US and foreign firms cutting off supplies to telecoms giant Huawei. 
 Beijing's move hits USD 60 billion worth of US goods with new punitive tariffs ranging from five to 25 percent, and comes in retaliation for Washington raising punitive tariffs on USD 200 billion in Chinese goods to 25 per cent. 
  
 Washington and Beijing resumed their trade battle last month when trade talks in the US ended without a deal, with American negotiators accusing Chinese negotiators of reneging on previous commitments. 
 The countries have exchanged tariffs on USD 360 billion in two-way trade so far. 
 The tit-for-tat tariff war has been upstaged in recent weeks by Washington's move to blacklist Chinese tech giant Huawei over national security concerns, threatening the firm's global ambitions. 
 The US Commerce Department placed Huawei on an ""entity list"" on grounds of national security on May 16, a move that curbs its access to US-made components it needs for its equipment. A 90-day reprieve was later issued. 
 Hitting back, China's commerce ministry said Friday it would release its own list of ""unreliable entities"" that break their commercial contracts and stop supplying Chinese firms. 
 ""For China's countermeasures, what we say, we do,"" said anchor Kang Hui on Chinese state-broadcaster CCTV's primetime news show that aired across multiple Chinese stations Friday. 
 ""Talk and our door is open. Fight, and we'll fight to the end,"" said Kang. 
 China's commerce ministry said it would roll out the detailed measures against companies on the list shortly, noting foreign firms that break contracts, cut off supplies or take other discriminatory measures against Chinese firms would be included. 
 ""Obviously it's mostly aimed at Huawei suppliers, Intel, Qualcomm, ARM ... if anything it's probably aimed at non-US companies, so European, South Korean and Japanese companies that may be trying to decide how strictly to apply the US ruling,"" said Andrew Polk, an economist at Trivium China. 
 China wants to make it a much more difficult choice to cut off supplies to Huawei, he added. 
 ""It's potentially putting companies in a situation where they are forced to choose between the US and China and that could definitely backfire on them,"" said Polk. 
 China's state-owned tabloid the Global Times said the new list would ""work as deterrent forming a protective barrier around Chinese companies"". 
 ""China is ready to wage a protracted economic and trade war with the United States,"" the nationalist paper said in an editorial. 
 Former Chinese officials warned Friday that the trade war could last decades. 
 ""It is quite clear now that this is no longer a trade dispute and will extend much more broadly to punitive economic measures that each side can inflict upon each other,"" said Christopher 
 Balding, a China expert at the Fulbright University Vietnam, adding it was reasonable to expect further escalation by each side. 
 ""It is quite possible there will be significant collateral damage here,"" Balding said. 
 Speaking at a defence and security conference in Singapore on Saturday, the acting US defense secretary said Huawei was ""too close"" to Beijing, creating ""too much risk"". 
 ""The integration of civilian businesses with the military is too close. China has national policies and laws where data is required to be shared,"" Patrick Shanahan told the forum. 
 US President Donald Trump more than doubled punitive tariffs on USD 200 billion in Chinese goods to 25 percent last month, and launched the process to hit nearly all remaining imports from the Asian giant. 
 China responded by increasing tariffs five percent to 25 percent on 5,410 American products Saturday, worth USD 60 billion in trade. 
 The list includes beauty products, sports equipment, musical instruments, wine, condoms, diamonds, wood, fabric and toys. 
 Washington's tariffs appear to have already had an impact on Chinese manufacturing activity, which contracted more than expected last month. 
 While Trump insists China will pay billions in duties, experts note that US consumers and importers bear the brunt of tariffs on products coming into the United States. 
 ""The United States remains an important export market for China, but its importance is declining,"" said Wang Shouwen, who was on China's negotiating team, according to official news agency Xinhua. 
 He emphasised the trade war's effect on China's economy would be ""controllable"". 
 ""If the US wants to force the Chinese to make concessions by engaging in unilateralism and putting on extreme pressure, this is impossible,"" said Wang, according to Xinhua.

 ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Joey Gallo stood in center field trying not to beat himself up after misplaying two fly balls into triples as he and the Texas Rangers trailed the Kansas City Royals by two runs going into the sixth inning. 
 Soon enough, Gallo took out his frustrations on the baseball. 
 Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth inning outburst as the Rangers rallied past the Royals 6-2 Friday night. 
 The Rangers have won five of their last six home games while the Royals have lost of four of their last five overall. 
 Gallo's home run, his team-leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet and landed in the second seating area beyond the center-field wall. 
 ""Things turned around quick,"" Gallo said. In his first season playing regularly in center, he also redeemed himself defensively by finishing the game with a diving catch in left-center on a ball hit by Billy Hamilton.

 Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. Jurado allowed two runs on five hits and three walks. The second-year right-hander, who was recalled from Triple-A Nashville on April 26, had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). 
 All of that on a night when his parents, Ariel Sr. and Yizel, had traveled from Panama to see him pitch in the majors for the first time. 
 ""That was something special,"" Jurado said through an interpreter. 
 With Jurado outpitched by veteran Royals left-hander Danny Duffy through five innings, Rangers manager Chris Woodward thought his youngster deserved a better fate given the circumstances. 
 ""I'm saying a little prayer 'cause the baseball gods should be with us on this one,"" Woodward said. ""Like, I was hoping for three (runs)."" 
 Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26, his first start of the season after recovering from last year's shoulder injury. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, he allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks - both in the sixth. 
 ""This game will rip your heart out sometimes,"" Duffy said. ""But I've got to turn the page after tonight and go back out there, try to be better next time."" 
 Texas loaded the bases in the sixth inning on outfield singles by Shin-Soo Choo and Elvis Andrus and a chopper hit between third base and the mound by Hunter Pence. Duffy fielded Pence's grounder, but his throw to first base was late. 
 Duffy walked Nomar Mazara with the bases loaded to tie the score 2-2. Gallo then launched a 1-1 fastball to end a six-game homerless streak, which matched his longest this season. 
 Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Cuthbert, who earlier Friday had his contract selected from Triple-A Omaha, hit an opposite-field homer that just cleared the right-field wall in the second and also made a standout play at third base. 
 ""He's always been a really good defender at third base for us,"" Royals manager Ned Yost said of Cuthbert. ""That's kind of expected."" 
 Gordon's triple in the fifth inning turned around Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway center, scoring Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. 
 All of that was forgotten in the bottom of the sixth. 
 SHORT HOPS 
 Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. ... The Royals lead the majors with 24 triples. ... Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base to give the Royals a major league-leading 53. 
 PRE-GAME MOVES 
 To make room for Cuthbert, the Royals designated INF-OF Chris Owings for assignment. The Rangers selected the contract of RHP David Carpenter from Nashville and optioned OF Zack Granite to Nashville. 
 TRAINER'S ROOM 
 Royals: OF Hunter Dozier (right thorax tightness) is day to day, leaving Thursday's game in the fifth inning and sitting out Friday. 
 Rangers: OF Willie Calhoun (left quad strain) will begin on-field work on Saturday. 
 UP NEXT 
 Royals: RHP Homer Bailey (4-5, 5.79), having joined the Royals this winter following 12 seasons with the Cincinnati Reds, will make his Globe Life Park debut on Saturday. 
 Rangers: RHP Lance Lynn (6-3, 4.67) has lowered his ERA from 6.51 over his last six starts, going 4-2.

 I have no idea what this is meant to mean. I'm not trying to say anything about any champions. If you think that I'm saying that Lucian the champion can AA stealthed units, you clearly didn't see the first word in the post title.

 So first, MoD does not require the first title (and is actually much better without it), and second, MoT likes you having seen the first, but doesn't require it. The glossary is there for a reason! 
 They'd probably have expected that if you were invested enough to play MoT, you would probably have researched after MoD and watched the anime, or again, just have used the glossary. 
 Yeah 
 This is probably the most accurate thing I've ever seen.

 Firstly, don't say shit without experienceing it  or  even considering  it. 
 Secondly, I have no idea about what you're thinking when you say I prove your points. 
 Thirdly, your comment about how much I question myself is absolute garbage, you can't just decide that and use that as a point. If anything, you're the one who doesn't question yourself. You hide behind the authority of ""everyone"" and exhibit an elitist ""I will not question any of my points, and the other person is wrong."" 
 Your passive aggressive ""pittying"" good wishing proves your elitist superiority complex. Stop it.

 To reply to your edit, I find it quite pretentious that you refer to the other people who are simply following the popular opinion as ""more knowledgeable people"". I did make good points, and I don't believe that I've said anything objectively wrong. 
 You say I clearly don't know about the entirety of the series, please elaborate on that as a vague statement like that holds no meaning. 
 You say that I rehash the same thing paraphrased, but that's exactly what you and ""all the others"" did too. 
 If you think that you should have left, then leave. You can go if you please. 
 Thanks for referring to me as a wrong sider and a lost cause. The wrong sider part is quite silly if you think about it as Takuru was simply using it to refer to the people he wished to be like but couldn't due to his social awkwardness, so do take that as you will. I believe that the man who continues to talk to the ""lost cause"" and follow the same mistakes as the ""lost cause"" even after criticizing them is the true ""lost cause"", so maybe you should stop going down this path. Might do you some mental good.

 Josef Newgarden wins 1st of 2 Detroit Grand Prix races 
 By LARRY LAGE - 2 hrs ago

 DETROIT (AP) — Josef Newgarden got a break and took full advantage of it. 
 Newgarden was fortunate a yellow flag came out when his race strategist called for a pit stop, helping the Team Penske driver take a lead he kept Saturday to win the first of two Detroit Grand Prix races. 
 ""Tim Cindric made the call of the race in my opinion,"" Newgarden said. ""He got us the win again. We had to execute, but getting that call from Tim was perfect."" 
 Newgarden finished nearly a second in front of Alexander Rossi on the rain-slicked course to take the IndyCar points lead. Rossi also was second in the Indianapolis 500. 
 Rossi came up just short after earning the pole and leading the first 18 laps of the 43-lap race. The Andretti Autosport driver lost the lead when he went in for a pit stop just before Ed Jones hit a wall, bringing out a yellow flag while Newgarden was making his pit stop. 
 ""He just got lucky with the yellow,"" Rossi said. 
 Roger Penske would say otherwise, according to Newgarden. 
 ""When you talk to Roger, he'll tell you that you make your own luck,"" Newgarden said. ""We were making that call regardless. The yellow certainly helped us."" 
 Rossi acknowledged Newgarden had more than good fortune on his side as he failed to catch him on the 2.35-mile road course on the banks of the Detroit River. 
 ""I tried to push him into a mistake, but he's a great driver,"" Rossi said. ""We were kind of just stuck."" 
 Rossi may not want to start out front Sunday for the second race in the Motor City because the position hasn't helped him win lately in Detroit. He also had the pole for the second of two races last year and led 46 of 63 laps, but he finished 12th after overshooting a turn and puncturing a tire. 
 Newgarden opened the year with a victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, and joined Indy 500 champion Simon Pagenaud as the series' two-time winners this season. Newgarden has won 12 IndyCar races since 2015. 
 Takuma Sato finished third on Belle Isle, followed by rookie Felix Rosenqvist and Ryan Hunter-Reay, who closed strong after spinning out and dropping to 15th early in the race. Pagenaud, who entered the race leading the series in points, was sixth after beginning 13th during a single-file start. 
 The 70-lap race became a 75-minute timed event after thunderstorms delayed the start by more than an hour. There were five yellow periods due at least in part to conditions, leading to 14 laps under caution and 29 under green. 
 Sato said the conditions were ""extremely difficult,"" for 22-car field. 
 ""The visibility is issue because of the water spray,"" Sato said. ""Secondly, incredibly slippery."" 
 Five-time champion Scott Dixon hit a wall to bring out another yellow flag, ending his race following 23 laps after he was running third. Dixon didn't finish a race for the first time in two years. He blamed himself, not the weather, for making a mistake. 
 ""The front actually gripped a little too much in Turn 6 and I caught the inside wall,"" Dixon said. ""When I hit the wall, it just broke the toe link. When it does that, it turns the opposite way and I went straight into the wall."" 
 The race started after a delay and there was more sputtering than speed on display. It began under a yellow flag after Zach Veach spun out just before the race was to begin. Shortly after the race resumed, the yellow flag came out again because Matheus Leist briefly lost control of his car.

 June 1, 2019 at 3:00 pm 
 We wrote extensively on the Celtics’ trip to L.A. in March of just how colossal a mess were the Lakers, and much of the attention of late has been focused on the front office intrigue. But while there has been some talk about how LeBron James‘ representation has factored in as it’s tried to pull strings, leave it to Paul Pierce to go back to the heart of that particular matter. 
 There is no question that James is still one of the best pick-your-small-number players in the league, but he looked out of place this past season on a roster that didn’t fit. And maybe when you consider the Lakers’ situation, LeBron isn’t all that well suited to the situation he entered. Things may still be salvaged for a short time if, as some NBA execs have laughed off, the club is able to get its, uh, stuff together and attract a key free agent and others to play with James. 
 But was this ever truly a hoop matter in the first place for LeBron? Pierce doesn’t think so. 
 “I said that when he went to this team,” he told the Herald. “I was like, it wasn’t a straight basketball decision. 
 “Based on a the roster, this was an after-basketball decision. They had an opportunity to make the team better, but based on how the team was when he went there, that wasn’t about basketball.” 
 The L.A. fans seemed to sense this from the start, and that uneasy feeling was on display no better than on the night at Staples Center when James passed Michael Jordan for fourth place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list. The response to the accomplishment and the congratulatory video weren’t nearly up to the milestone. It was as if the fans didn’t see James as a Laker, even though he was wearing purple and gold. 
 “Well, he’s not,” said Pierce. “I mean, you think about all the great Lakers. They came up with them or got traded there and then were there for long years. You know, he accomplished this feat in his first year, and then on a team that wasn’t even in the midst of a playoff run anymore.” 
 Switching to a team that’s closer to Pierce’s heart, the Patriots will be losing their Truth at the same time they lose their quarterback. 
 “When Brady retires is when I retire and go to the Rams,” he said. “When Brady goes, then I’m coming home.” 
 While Pierce has become a huge Pats fan, the lure of the Rams was natural once they moved back to California and began building a new mega-stadium in his hometown of Inglewood, across the street from The Forum, where the Lakers used to play. 
 But Pierce isn’t running away as long as Tom Brady is standing behind center. And even though he lives back in the L.A. area again, Paul didn’t hide his loyalties when the Pats met the Rams in the Super Bowl. 
 “Everybody hated me wearing my Patriots stuff around here,” he said. “It was an ugly game, but, shoot, they got it done. They got it done.” 
 Winging it 
 Congratulations to good guy Juwan Howard on getting the head coaching job as his alma mater, Michigan. 
 But he may have some explaining to do if the subject ever turns to his role on an episode of “The West Wing” a long while back. 
 Howard was cast as Mr. Grant, allegedly a member of President Bartlet’s council on physical fitness, but more importantly brought in as a ringer for Martin Sheen‘s pickup hoop team. Where it gets a little dicey for Michigan folks is that, according to the script, Howard had been a star at Duke, which was the Wolverines’ most hated rival back when he was playing for real. 
 Asked by the Herald if he’d sought to get that part of the storyline fixed, Howard said, “You know what? I tried. I sure did. I suggested that we say, you know, Juwan from Michigan. But they were like, you know what, they showed me the script and they said they thought it would be pretty funny if it had me being from Duke. 
 “So it got me out of my comfort zone, but at the end of the day I thought it was like, OK, I’ll go along with it. But, you know, I look back on it and I’m kind of happy I did it, because I built relationships along the way. Martin Sheen was one of the best guys ever to work with.” 
 Celts to the core 
 This is the first chance I’m getting on these pages to acknowledge the passing of John Havlicek and Andy Jick, both of them Celtics to the core. I was fortunate to make their acquaintance when I came onto this beat and was better for knowing both the star player and the impeccable Garden public address announcer. 
 The first time I saw Havlicek when he wasn’t playing came the night my high school played a preliminary game at the old Garden before the Celts took on the 76ers. 
 John was sitting past the baseline near our bench, and he looked profoundly unimpressed as he gazed upon our affair. 
 Many years later, I told him this story and he politely said he was probably just focused on his upcoming game. Then he smiled and said, “But you could be right.” 
 Andy was simply a good soul. He was great at his job, delightfully understated in a way that fit the Celtics right down to their then-traditional black sneakers. He was a friend to all those who worked on game nights, always wanting to make sure things were going well with you. 
 And his voice was a large part of the sound track to the Larry Bird era. On nights when there was a special ceremony, Andy’s part on the script was listed as “VOICE OF GOD.” We used to joke that his father, a highly regarded rabbi, must have found it pretty interesting to learn this about the kid he’d helped raise. 
 The Beal thing 
 Bradley Beal remains one of Jayson Tatum‘s strongest supporters, having known him and his family from their time together back in St. Louis. A while ago, he checked in with some thoughts about a sophomore season that was better than some think but still a little difficult for the young Celtic. 
 “It’s tough, because he had a lot of success last year,” said Beal, who’s facing upheaval with his Wizards. “A lot. And he may have been pressuring himself in having Kyrie (Irving) back and having Gordon (Hayward) back. It’s tough. I always say it’s tough, because you have so many talented guys on one team.” 
 Beal then spoke of the need to sacrifice, which never really came in any concerted way. He praised Brad Stevens and the veteran Celts who could guide Tatum. 
 “I think he’s in a perfect spot,” Beal said. 
 Looking ahead, he added, “I’m biased, but he’s very talented. He’s really talented. He’s a special player, and he just has so much more room to grow. I think that’s the scary part about his game. Everybody sees how effective he is and what he’s done, and he has 15 more years to play. So he’s got a long way to go. I’m happy for him. He’s a key piece to the team.” 
 Beal will offer Tatum advice when asked, but he gives the younger friend his space. 
 “He puts his own pressure on himself. He has his own expectations,” Beal said. “I let him stay in his lane, and I stay in my lane. He’s a grown man. There’s not too much I can tell him at this point. He plays on one of the best teams in the East. He has a lot of guys to learn from. I give him some pointers here and there, but it’s his career. It’s his life.” 
 Asked who is tougher on Tatum, Stevens or his mom, Beal laughed and said, “[Shoot], Brandy. Brandy all day every day. Like my mom. She’ll cuss his [backside] out in a heartbeat.”",1
11604,"Al Swearengen is still riding high at The Gem. 
 HBO 
 After 10 years, they’re all still there — Seth Bullock and Al Swearengen and Trixie and Charlie Utter, and on and on. The residents of Deadwood, the mining camp, and Deadwood , the TV show, are all still hanging around one of the greatest settings for a TV series ever. 
 And even more people are coming back to town for a celebration of the newly formed statehood of South Dakota. Alma Garret and her daughter, Sofia, arrive on the train, as does Senator George Hearst, the closest thing Deadwood ever had to a villain. Deadwood: The Movie — the long overdue conclusion to David Milch’s magnum opus Western — brings them all back together for one last two-hour journey. 
 Rating: 4.5 out of 5

 A few characters are missing, whether because they died on the series, which aired from 2004 to 2006; because the actor who plays them was tied up in another gig (Titus Welliver’s Silas Adams is absent due to a conflict with his role as the title character on Bosch); or because the actor who played them died after Deadwood left the air. (Most notably, saloon owner Cy Tolliver, played by Powers Boothe, who died in 2017, is no longer present.) 
 But mostly, they’re all still there, in Deadwood, the mining camp that became a microcosm of America and maybe even humanity, on the series I love more than any other ever made. (Somewhat regrettably, “they’re all still there” includes actor Jeffrey Jones, who pleaded no contest to soliciting pornographic photos of a teenager in 2002, and whose character is peripheral enough in the scheme of Deadwood that when the actor turns up in a few scenes, it’s actually a little jarring.) 
 There is something comforting about this, about imagining all of these people living their lives in the camp, even if we haven’t been able to look in on them all these years. But there’s also something heartbreaking about not having the chance to visit for so long. They’re older and weaker, and so are we.

 Deadwood: The Movie has a retro feel that ends up serving it well 
 Even Anna Gunn came back, as Martha Bullock! 
 HBO 
 I mean what I’m about to say is a compliment, even if it might not sound like one: Deadwood: The Movie feels like the best TV episode of 1997. 
 Its rhythms have a very 1990s TV feel to them, right down to a closing musical montage that wouldn’t have felt out of place on Northern Exposure. It takes its time getting into the story, spending its first 40 minutes or so on reunions and other matters of relatively little importance to the plot. And, yes, there is a plot — revolving around a disputed gold claim, as all plots on Deadwood inevitably must — but if you’ve never watched this show before, you might wonder what all the fuss is about before it kicks in. 
 The central idea of the film seems to be about the circularity of time and the way generations give way to the next. There’s a brand-new woman who wants to ply her trade at the local brothel, The Gem, and the movie draws lines between her and many other women of the Gem from Deadwood’s three-season run, but not in a way that definitively makes her the daughter of one of them or something. This is just the way life operates. People die, and more people are born, and everything lurches forward and backward in a way that suggests progress but, maybe, doesn’t actually signal it. 
 Deadwood: The Movie is also deeply haunted by its past self. Frequently, the characters reflect on moments from the original show, and there are few series on TV as interested in the way death ripples throughout a community as this one. Some of the characters continue to ruminate on the death of Wild Bill Hickok, which happened in the Deadwood’s fourth episode ever; even if Hickok’s passing has no bearing on the events of the movie, those who loved him still miss him. 
 These glances toward the past mean you’ll probably get more enjoyment out of Deadwood: The Movie if you’ve watched the whole series — but I don’t think it’s completely necessary to have done so. There is so much here that will be rich and meaningful to any TV fan, and its story is self-contained enough that you could use it as an entry point to the entire series. (That is if you don’t mind being spoiled on several major events from all three seasons, which are depicted in flashbacks.) 
 The show comes by its ruefulness honestly. Deadwood: The Movie was originally supposed to be two movies, originally supposed to happen over a decade ago — closer to the end of the series. In the 13 years that have elapsed since Deadwood ended, series creator Milch, one of the greatest TV writers to ever have lived, has landed two TV series on the air that were both canceled after one season ( John From Cincinnati and Luck ), had several pilots passed on by HBO, and been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease . 
 This movie is, in all likelihood, his swan song, and it is infused with an impotent rage in the face of death, by the fact that you can try your damnedest, but you can’t ever outrun the inevitable. 
 What makes Milch so good is the way he understands humans both as individuals — driven by often contradictory impulses — and as collectives. He understands that a scene shifts depending on who’s in it, and that large communities of people will come to have a kind of group consciousness that shifts and changes based on the faintest trembles of the wind. 
 And he also understands mercy. 
 Deadwood began as a series filled with anger. It ends as a series about learning to move past slights and endure. 
 HBO 
 The first scene of Deadwood’s pilot features Seth Bullock ( Timothy Olyphant , who is honestly the best he’s ever been in the movie) hanging a criminal himself, rather than letting a lynch mob do it. As a US marshal, he’s a representative of “the law,” but this far out on the frontier, the law has less meaning than it normally does. The scene embodies the central tension of Deadwood in microcosm: How do we build a civilization out of nothing? Under whose authority? 
 The first four episodes of the series — which climax in Hickok’s death — are the most classically Western. But after Hickok dies, his murderer isn’t immediately killed by the residents of the camp. Instead, they hold a trial and attempt to convict him in a more lawful fashion. Therein lies the optimism of Deadwood: Individuals may be driven by rage, but pull enough of them together and they might build a better world by balancing each other’s furies. 
 That sense of balance is why Bullock and Al Swearengen ( Ian McShane ) are the series’ two central characters. Bullock is a man who’s channeled his rage toward the more useful purpose of helping keep the peace, while Swearengen inverts that type — he’s hidden his fundamental sweetness in the name of being a cutthroat bastard. Over the course of the original seasons, they learn better how to balance their true selves and the men they have to be to fulfill the role society requires of them. The joy of Deadwood: The Movie is in how Milch finds ways to continue these essential evolutions after another 10 years have passed in the two men’s lives. 
 Deadwood was never just about that rage and sudden explosions of violence. Those elements were always part of its mix, but the series was always driven by mercy and kindness, by the small ways that people care for each other in times of need. And in the movie, there are moments when both Bullock and Swearengen find themselves in positions where they don’t need to extend mercy, but they do it anyway, reaching out and taking someone else’s hand, just for a moment, rather than spreading their anger further up and out. 
 This is how civilization is built, in Deadwood’s estimation: by way of a million tiny moments in which someone chooses not to do further harm when they could, but to find a way to treat others with kindness and charity. Deadwood often suggests — via lengthy shots that don’t cut away but instead track from character to character, drawing them together into a web — that people are connected in ways that remain mysteries to them. The movie suggests not that future generations better understand the mystery, but that as they solve old ones, new ones are born. That’s a natural part of progress. 
 It’s 10 years later in Deadwood, and it’s 13 years later for Deadwood. The place looks much the same as before, but it also looks a little smaller. The people are older, but they’re still themselves. The viewers, too — we’re all in different places than we were when the show first ran. (Heck, it was just 10 years ago that I began reviewing every episode of the series at the A.V. Club , a few years after the show had been canceled.) And even if there are the rudiments of a plot, what is most miraculous about Deadwood: The Movie is that all these people are still here. Life continues, as it must. 
 Deadwood: The Movie airs tonight at 8 p.m. Eastern on HBO . All three seasons of the original series are available in their entirety on HBO’s streaming platforms.

 Perdue Foods recalls more than 30,100 pounds of chicken products

53474,"Massive “Fire Tornado” Blaze Started By A Flat Tire; White House Declares “Major Disaster” In California – The Millennium Report 
 10 months ago 
 Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Email 
 By Zero Hedge 
 One the most destructive wildfires in California history, the Carr fire, is still raging with only about 40% of it contained while elsewhere in the state, especially in the north, fires  continue to expand . 
 Overnight a seventh person was reported killed by the Carr fire as another in the north of the state expanded by 25% overnight, leading the White House to declare a “major disaster” in California in a statement on Sunday morning. President Donald Trump has ordered the release of federal funding for recovery efforts. 
 The deadly Carr fire has scorched more than 145,000 acres as of Sunday morning; and as CNN reports, the wildfire which began on July 23rd was actually  caused by a flat tire .

 The CNN report details the Carr fire’s origins in late July — but one of the 17 currently  burning across the state : 
 It happens countless times on roads across America: a vehicle gets a flat tire, usually just a temporary inconvenience. 
 But on one road near Redding, California, when a tire failed last month on a trailer and its rim scraped the asphalt, the result was catastrophic for an entire region. 
 The sparks that shot out July 23 from that minor incident, California fire officials said, ignited what is now  the sixth-most destructive  wildfire in state history. 
 The Carr Fire blazed  a fiery path along Highway 299 , lighting up mile after mile of dry brush as it crept up on residential areas. 
 One man, Ed Bledsoe, lost his wife and two great-grandchildren, ages 4 and 5, within only a 15 minute time frame. 
 The man’s family were victims of the  previously reported “fire tornado,”  or what some are calling a “firenado” that ripped through Redding, which produced whirling winds of fire in excess of 143 mph. 
 “The tornado was hovering over the house,” Bledsoe’s granddaughter Amanda Woodley recounted to  CNN . “It was just a tornado fire over the house.” 
 Ed Bledsoe and other family members gave an account of the unbelievable and tragic moments  the fire tornado struck  : 
 He said his son drove toward the flames in the hope of rescuing his family members. “My son said the grass wasn’t on fire, the trees were getting sucked up in the air and burning,” Bledsoe told CNN. “He said when he opened his doors, the leaves hit him like somebody was slapping him. He said it was sucking his breath out, and he got back in his car and tried to get out.” 
 Bledsoe was on the phone with his wife and great-grandchildren until the very end. 
 “It sucked the roof off the house and the walls fell out and the roof went right down on them,” he said. 
 “This is historic in the U.S.,” Craig Clements, director of San Jose State University’s Fire Weather Research Laboratory,  told BuzzFeed News . “This might be the strongest fire-induced tornado-like circulation ever recorded.” 
 The blaze has even created its own weather system, according to multiple climatologist reports. 
 Known as a pyrocumulus cloud, the ominous red weather formations usually occur over volcanic eruptions or forest fires when intensely heated air triggers an upward motion that pushes smoke and water vapor to rapidly rise. They can develop their own weather patters, including thunderstorms with severe winds which then further fan the flames. 
 On Saturday morning an astrophysics professor and Chief Scientist at the Center for Planetary Science at St. Petersburg College, Antonio Paris, posted a surreal photograph he identified as “firenado” that occurred Friday:

 Meanwhile, a number of areas of the state, including parts of Shasta County where the Carr fire is still burning, are still under evacuation orders while firefighting teams endure exhaustion and casualties.

 Among the six dead from the Carr Fire include two firefighters: one has been identified as Jeremy Stoke who was in the middle of a rescue attempt and another unidentified bulldozer operator killed while battling the flames. Some 1,500 structures have been burned to the ground in the Carr Fire alone, and state fire officials  estimate  the wildfires will cost California billions of dollars over the next decade. 
 “What we’re seeing in California right now is more destructive, larger fires burning at rates that we have historically never seen,” Cal Fire spokesman Jonathan Cox told  CNN .

 In Northern California, the Mendocino Complex Fire surpassed the size of Carr fire by the weekend, and is now the state’s largest at more than two-thirds the size of sprawling Los Angeles, which has forced the evacuation of nearly 16,000 residents and destroyed more than 100 structures. 
 New  reports indicate  the Mendocino Complex Fire is threatening 9,000 structures. 
 Image via Reuters 
 Eyewitnesses have  described  entire swathes of charred land and streets that look “like a bomb hit”with cars and homes turned to ash. 
 In total there are 17 wildfires which have ravaged pars of the state, some of them now nearly 100% contained, as over 14,000 firefighters from California and more than a dozen other states continue to work on the front lines.

 File photo: Suspect Roy Charles Waller faces a total of 45 felony counts tied to attacks on nine women between 1991 and 2006 in six counties: Sacramento, Butte, Contra Costa, Solano, Sonoma and Yolo.

 By Sam Stanton and Darrell Smith | Sacramento Bee 
 NorCal Rapist suspect Roy Charles Waller faces a new delay in his case, with a judge agreeing in Sacramento to postpone the preliminary hearing to Aug. 16 to allow the defense more time to study DNA and other evidence being compiled by prosecutors. 
 Waller, 59, made a brief appearance Friday morning in Sacramento Superior Court, standing silently inside a cage on the first floor of the Sacramento County Jail, where he has been held in isolation since his arrest last year. 
 Waller faces a total of 45 felony counts tied to attacks on nine women between 1991 and 2006 in six counties: Sacramento, Butte, Contra Costa, Solano, Sonoma and Yolo. 
 He has been held without bail since DNA hits linked him to the series of attacks and led to his arrest at UC Berkeley, where he worked as a safety specialist. He had faced a preliminary hearing set for June 26, but that is now postponed to August so that his court-appointed attorney, Joseph Farina, can study evidence against him and conclude other trials he is currently handling. 
 “There’s still more material coming,” Farina said after the hearing. “There was no way I was going to be ready by June 26.” 
 Farina renewed his standing objection to media coverage, but has been routinely rebuffed in efforts to keep cameras out of the courtroom. 
 “We don’t really need his face being splattered all across the 6 o’clock news,” he said after court. “I don’t have a choice. We’ve filed an objection more than once and will continue to do so because there may be identity issues here at some point. 
 “Let’s face it, this case goes back several decades, so other than DNA in many instances there is no eyewitness identification. Or, in some cases, the police reports have been destroyed so they have not been filed at all.” 
 Waller’s appearance in court was delayed for more than hour so Farina could meet with him in the jail before facing the bank of media cameras. 
 “I wanted to go up and see him first before he came down because I’ve been in trial,” Farina said. “I haven’t been able to see him as much as I’d like. I have an attorney assisting me who’s been able to see him, but he’s up on the eighth floor in total separation because of the nature of the charges. 
 “Obviously, they can’t protect him if he’s anywhere else. It would be no small stretch of the imagination that someone would want to hurt him because of the notoriety, so he has to be held in total separation, which means he can’t have any packages up there. He’s in total separation by himself. You can imagine that’s kind of depressing…”

39247,"Newberry: Let's ignore Drake for rest of the Finals 
  
 By Paul  NewberryAP Sports Columnist 
 Friday 
 May 31, 2019 at 7:10 PM May 31, 2019 at 7:10 PM 
 Obnoxious sideline celebrities are as much a part of the NBA as slam dunks and getting away with an extra step or two. 
 From Jack Nicholson to Spike Lee to Jimmy Buffett, we've grown accustomed to boorish, entitled superstars doing their best to make themselves part of the game. Welcome to the club, Drake. 
 The Toronto rapper-slash-superfan has gotten as much air time as anyone on the court with his antics during the playoffs. He mocked Philadelphia's Joel Embiid. He rubbed the shoulders of Raptors coach Nick Nurse during a game. 
 And, after the opener of the NBA Finals, he exchanged some heated words with Golden State's Draymond Green. 
 Here's an idea: Let's ignore Drake for the rest of what could be a memorable series between the Raptors and Warriors. 
 That goes for the TV cameras that can't seem to turn away from him. That goes for those of us in the media who can't seem to quit writing about him (I promise, this will be my one and only Drake column). And it most certainly goes for the Warriors, who need to stay focused on the important task at hand — trying to win their fourth championship in five years — when Drake starts hurling his childish taunts. 
 Green insisted the incident in Game 1 was no big deal. 
 ""You got a question about basketball?"" he shot back when a reporter brought it up afterward. ""It wasn't really a scuffle because I didn't hit him and he didn't hit me, and I didn't push him and he didn't push me. We talked. We barked a little bit, but I wouldn't necessarily consider that a scuffle."" 
 No doubt looking to move records and build his brand, Drake was in his full troll mode for the start of the first Finals held outside the United States, turning up at his familiar courtside seat in a replica of the Raptors jersey worn by Dell Curry at the end of his career — a jab, of course, at Dell's son, Warriors star Steph Curry. 
 After Toronto secured its 118-109 victory, Drake confronted Green on his way off the court. It's not clear all that was said between the two, but Drake could be seen mouthing ""trash"" as a smiling Curry stepped in to make sure Green went on to the locker room. 
 With a night to sleep on things, Green was downright diplomatic during the off day Friday. He knows the best way to answer Drake's insults is to play better than he did in Game 1, when he contributed a mere 10 points on 2-of-9 shooting and struggled to contain the Raptors' emerging star, Pascal Siakam. 
 ""He talks and it gets more attention because he's Drake,"" Green said. 
 While the NBA certainly loves the off-the-court attention that it celebrity fans generate, Commissioner Adam Silver made it clear that there's a line Drake should not cross — which he clearly did in the Eastern Conference finals by briefly grabbing Nurse's shoulders as the oblivious coach looked up at the scoreboard during Game 4 against the Milwaukee Bucks. 
 ""We certainly appreciate his superfan status, and I know he's beloved in the community of Toronto,"" Silver said. But, the commish quickly added, ""Certainly we don't want fans, friend or foe, contacting an NBA coach during a game. I think that even as Nick Nurse later said, 'I didn't even realize it was Drake or hardly was aware that I was being touched,' and I think those can lead to dangerous situations. You're in the middle of coaching a game and you're completely focused, you obviously don't want somebody who is not on your team touching you."" 
 Better than any other league, the NBA knows how to nurture and protect its superstars — a philosophy that has extended to its most famous fans at least as far back as the days when Nicholson was razzing Los Angeles Lakers' opponents during the Showtime era, or Lee was getting away with far more than most fans while taunting Reggie Miller during playoff games at Madison Square Garden (yes, kids, the New York Knicks were once a competitive NBA franchise that made the postseason on a regular basis). 
 Silver said the league spoke with Drake and his management team about avoiding contact with players and coaches, apparently coming to an understanding that he wouldn't do it again. 
 ""Given Drake's relationship to the team, it's not the same as just any fan who happened to be courtside touching a coach,"" the commissioner said. ""But I think that's an absolute bright line that we have to draw. So that's one example and I would also say that I think the issue for the league is that he has this ambassador-type role with the team. So he is viewed a little differently than any fan sitting there. But at the same time, I think there are appropriate lines that shouldn't be cross in terms of how a competing team is addressed or the officials for that matter."" 
 While a case could certainly be made that Drake should be banished to a less-prominent seat during the remaining games in Toronto (as Buffett once was during a Miami Heat contest for cursing at the officials), even Green said that wasn't necessary. 
 ""So many people are complaining about it, like, 'You don't let any other fan do that,'"" the Warriors star said. ""Yeah, any other fan is just not Drake, so they probably shouldn't be able to do that. That's just kind of how the cookie crumbles. He's worked his (butt) off to be who he is. I think we all know when you do that, you get more leash than others. I think there's so much talk and the NBA needs to ... no, they don't. He worked to be who he is, (so) you should get more leash. I don't mind it. It's fun for me."" 
 The best way for Green and the Warriors to shut Drake up is to win another title. As for the rest of us, let's just ignore him.

 HOGP

 BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Scientists tasked with reviewing government plans to lift protections for gray wolves across most of the U.S. said in a report released Friday that the proposal has numerous factual errors and other problems. 
 The five-member scientific panel's conclusions were detailed in a 245-page report delivered to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
 One reviewer said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service appeared to have come to a pre-determined conclusion, not supported by its own science, that wolves should come off the endangered species list. 
 ""It looks like they decided to delist and then they compiled all the evidence that they thought supported that decision. It simply doesn't support the decision,"" said Adrian Treves, an environmental studies professor at the University of Wisconsin. 
 Treves said a chief concern is poaching: Without protections, illegal killings of wolves could rise, he said. 
 The findings could undercut the government's contention that gray wolves across the Lower 48 have recovered from near extermination. 
 Federal officials have been under increasing pressure to put wolves under state management, which is already the case in parts of the Northern Rockies where hunting and trapping of the animals is allowed. 
 Prohibitions on hunting elsewhere have fueled resentment against wolves among livestock owners who must deal with attacks by the predators. Also, some hunters see wolves as competition for big game animals. 
 After being nearly wiped out in the Lower 48 early last century, more than 6,000 gray wolves now live in portions of nine states. The decades-long, government-sponsored recovery effort for the animals has cost roughly $160 million. 
 Yet gray wolves remain absent from most of their historical range. Critics of lifting protections say the move would be premature and worry that more hunting will reverse the species' rebound. 
 Wildlife service spokeswoman Vanessa Kauffman said officials were still going over the scientific report and had no immediate response. 
 Members of the review panel questioned the agency's treatment of a basic issue: whether gray wolves in the Lower 48 states are biologically the same or consist of more than one species. 
 Daniel MacNulty, an associate professor at Utah State University, said the proposed rule had ""demonstrable errors of fact, interpretation, and logic"" and its description of where wolves presently range is fuzzy. 
 Five years ago, a similar report helped convince federal officials to temporarily shelve plans to lift wolf protections. That report, too, questioned the science used by federal officials.

 Joe Moore Award finds a permanent home in Pittsburgh 
 Fri., May 31, 2019 10:34 a.m. | Friday, May 31, 2019 10:34 a.m. 
 Foundation for Teamwork  
 In Aaron Taylor’s mind, there are two appropriate places to display a trophy named after legendary coach Joe Moore and honoring college football’s top offensive line: 
 • The school that wins it, of course, should get to display the 7-foot tall, 6-foot long, 3-foot wide, 800-pound “behemoth.” (Taylor’s word) 
 • And, just as logically, it should find a permanent home in Pittsburgh. After all, Moore got his start at Upper St. Clair and coached Pro Football and College Football Hall of Famers at Pitt. 
 As a result, a scaled-down replica of the trophy was unveiled Friday and can be viewed beginning June 15 at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum at the Heinz History Center. 
 “He really stood for the principles of toughness and teamwork, which is Pittsburgh through and through,” Taylor said Friday morning on 93.7 FM. 
 Moore is recognized as one of the great offensive line coaches in college football history, having spent 20 seasons at three schools while sending 52 players to the NFL: 
 • Pitt, from 1977-1985, where he coached College Football Hall of Famers and first-team All-Americans Mark May, Jimbo Covert and Bill Fralic , plus Pro Football Hall of Famer Russ Grimm. 
 • Temple, from 1986-1987. 
 • Notre Dame, from 1988-1996, where he helped Taylor and Andy Heck become All-American linemen. 
 “He essentially taught me I was capable of doing more than I thought I could,” Taylor said. “He was masterful at teaching us to push ourselves beyond our perceived limitations.” 
 “When God decided to create a football coach he created Joe Moore, then broke the mold,” Covert said in a statement. 
 Four years ago, Taylor, who played five seasons in the NFL and is now a college football analyst for CBS Sports, spawned the idea of an award to honor the nation’s best line and name it after Moore, who died in 2003. 
 It has been awarded every year since 2015 to Alabama, Iowa, Notre Dame and Oklahoma where the original trophy will be on display this season.",1

 YORKTOWN, Va. (AP) — John Broadwater sits on a boat in the York River, waiting for word from a diver below. 
 If this were a movie, it would be the perfect time for a flashback. The silver hair on Broadwater's head would turn dark again, and viewers would be transported to 30 years ago — the last time he was here doing much the same thing. 
 In May, for the first time in nearly three decades, archaeologists slipped into the murky York to assess what's left of the Lost Fleet at Yorktown, a British convoy sent to its doom during the last major battle of the Revolutionary War. 
 For two centuries, the shipwrecks melted away — swallowed by time, silt and the elements. Alarm bells sounded in the 1970s after a diving magazine mentioned the wrecks, prompting an invasion of sport divers fetching artifacts for themselves. 
 Broadwater, wearing the official title of state underwater archaeologist back then — he was Virginia's first — led a team mobilized to study, excavate and find ways to protect the remains. 
 In 1988, a 20-page spread in National Geographic detailed their accomplishments — more than 5,000 relics recovered for posterity from one wreck alone, a ship named Betsy. 
 But state budget cuts came shortly after, and Broadwater's position was axed. Work stopped on the project, and relics went into storage — many of them uninspected, which led to a scramble just last year, when live hand grenades from The Betsy were discovered sitting on shelves at the Department of Historic Resources in Richmond. 
 After the cuts, Broadwater had to move on. He oversaw the salvaging of the Monitor, the famed Civil War ironclad that went down off North Carolina. He helped Jeff Bezos retrieve sunken rocket boosters from Apollo moon missions. He worked with movie director James Cameron in the North Atlantic, descending more than two miles to the Titanic, eating his lunch in a submarine perched on the legendary liner's grand staircase. 
 But the Yorktown shipwrecks kept calling to him. It was more than just the nagging of a job left unfinished. Last year, Broadwater and two partners — Ryan Johnston and Steve Ormsby — formed JRS Explorations, largely to return to this river. 
 ""The three of us share a passion for this story,"" he says. 
 Now, at 75 years old, Broadwater has come home. He's working with volunteers — some from the old Betsy days. Most of their equipment is donated. Most expenses are covered by the partners' own money. 
 There's no hope of getting rich by finding treasure. All relics will belong to the public, a pledge embedded in the company's incorporation papers. 
 Sitting on the boat this crisp, spring morning, Broadwater looks pretty happy. The locations of 10 wrecks are known but remote surveying done last spring hinted at some never-before-discovered targets, like the mound of rocks the diver is down there investigating right now. They might be ballast. 
 Today's electronics — navigation systems, sonar, sensors — are way more precise than yesterday's. A magnetometer detected the presence of metal around those rocks. Could be nails or iron from an old ship. 
 ""It feels really good to be back,"" Broadwater says, blue eyes shining. 
 Sandwiched between Yorktown and Gloucester Point, he's in a natural spot to re-tell the story of what happened here 238 years ago. 
 ""You just can't make up fiction like that,"" Broadwater says. ""If anything had gone differently or happened one or two days later or earlier, well, the what-ifs are just endless."" 
 As he talks, the peaceful setting around the boat seems to fade away. The neat lawns lining the riverbanks. The kids playing with sand buckets on a beach. The whoosh of traffic over the nearby Coleman bridge. 
 In a movie, it would be time for another flashback. 
 _ 
 Six years into the Revolutionary War, the York River bristles with the masts of British ships. It's the fall of 1781 and the village up on the bluffs is in ruins. 
 Sixteen thousand troops from the Continental Army and its French Allies are dug into dirt redoubts ringing the town, trading shots with 8,000 British troops trapped against the river. 
 The bombardment is relentless — cannon, howitzers, mortar — a slug-fest hammering day and night. 
 But the British commander, Lord Charles Cornwallis, isn't giving up. He's expecting reinforcements to sail into the river any day. 
 Instead, French 74-gun warships show up, having run off the British armada at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. Cornwallis has 50 or so vessels of his own anchored in the river, but only a handful of small warships. 
 One of his best, the 44-gun Charon, has already gone down, set afire by red-hot shot aimed from shore. 
 Cornwallis tries every move in the play book. 
 He sets a few of his own ships afire and tries to drift them into the French warships. No luck. 
 He tries to slip away, loading his men into small boats to make for Gloucester, but a storm roars in and swamps the attempt. 
 Finally, he resorts to a tactic that's been used by others: He sacrifices his own fleet. 
 Cornwallis sends a line of his ships toward the Yorktown beach until they run aground, forming a barrier he hopes will stop the French from landing troops. 
 To keep the rest out of his convoy out of enemy hands — as well as block the river with wreckage — Cornwallis issues orders to scuttle. Holes are drilled or chiseled in hulls and the vessels sink. 
 It's not enough. Cornwallis winds up surrendering on Oct. 19, just as a British fleet prepares to sail from New York to his rescue. 
 It's a decisive outcome, the beginning of the end. Officially done two years later, the war propels a wave of change that winds up washing around the world. 
 A yell from the dive boat breaks the spell. 
 Bill Waldrop has been under for about 20 minutes, using a probe to test the bottom around the rocks. 
 ""When you hit something with it, you can tell the difference by the sound of the tap,"" Broadwater has explained. ""Rock makes a 'tink.' Wood makes a 'thunk.'"" 
 The yell came from Mike Nusbaum, spotting for Waldrop on the dive boat. Waldrop has just radioed up. 
 ""He's found wood!"" Nusbaum hollers. 
 Excitement flickers through the crew on the boat with Broadwater. Bill Utley, an expert in military history, worked with Broadwater on Betsy. Joshua Daniel, at the helm, runs his own marine survey company. 
 They all know that finding wood is a promising sign. The next step: search for the telltale humps of ship ribs — evenly spaced, poking up so slightly under their blanket of silt. 
 Diving in the York isn't easy. Currents rip and visibility is rarely more than a foot. But if they can locate and measure timbers, they can determine the ship's size, then scour through old maritime records for a possible ID. 
 ""The idea of going down there and seeing a ship no one has seen for 200 years, and being able to tell its story,"" Broadwater says, ""now that's just really something."" 
 There's no complete list of exactly how many ships Cornwallis had or sank, or how many were raised afterward by the French, who were granted salvage rights. 
 The hope is to find as many new ones as possible and document any changes in the old ones since Broadwater gave them their last good check in 1990. Research, preservation and artifact display are the priorities. There's an effort to nominate the area as a National Marine Sanctuary. 
 ""If you come to Yorktown and only see the redoubts,"" Broadwater says, ""you're missing half the battlefield."" 
 The Lost Fleet isn't the only act from Broadwater's life that's come full circle. Earlier this year, he was rehired as the state underwater archaeologist, the first time anyone has filled those shoes since he stepped out of them. It's only part-time and there's only enough funding to last a year. 
 ""I'm just hoping I can prove the value of putting someone back in that position full-time,"" he says. ""In a state like this, it's just crazy not to have that."" 
 To do the Yorktown shipwrecks right, Broadwater says, JRS will need a long-haul backer. Government funding is not on the horizon. 
 ""It'll take a special kind of investor,"" he says, ""since this isn't about treasure. They have to be in it for our history."" 
 If this were a movie, cue that backer.

 Asamoah Gyan and Dede Ayew 
 General Captain of the Black Stars, Asamoah Gyan is calling for unity among the Black Stars ahead of the 2019 AFCON tournament in Egypt. 
 The four-time champions are seeking to end their 37-year wait for continental success, having won their last title in 1982. 
 Despite losing his captaincy to Andre Ayew ahead of the continental showpiece, the Kayserispor forward is willing to let bygones be bygones for the collective good. 
 “24 countries have the chance to win but it depends on team work in camp, this is not a one man sport like boxing but rather football is about unity,” Gyan told Oyerepa FM. 
 “When going to tournaments like this I recuse myself from predicting because it’s easier said than done, anyone can say Ghana will lift the trophy, pastors, religious leaders will say theirs but at the end of the day, if we don’t put in any effort, that’s when we are going to laugh at the wrong side of our mouth.” 
 “That’s why am preaching unity, team work. Should we be united and get everything right, I’m sure we can clinch the trophy for Ghana,” he deduceed. 
 Ghana have been drawn in Group F alongside Benin, Guinea-Bissau and defending champions Cameroon. 
 Gyan will be expected to play a key role for the Black Stars in the tournament.",1

 Back to Gallery 
 BALTIMORE (AP) — If the San Francisco Giants had more games like this, Bruce Bochy would have far more reason to smile during his final season as a big league manager. 
 Backed by timely hitting and an error-free defense, San Francisco starter Shaun Anderson stuck around for seven innings and earned his first big league win , an 8-2 rout of the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday. 
 Brandon Belt drove in four runs and Buster Posey homered for the Giants, who built a 7-1 lead in the fifth and cruised to only their second win in 10 games. The Giants came in ranked last in the NL with a .221 batting average and had scored as many as seven runs only once in their previous 19 games. 
 ""We moved guys over. We hit guys in,"" Bochy said. ""We played the game well today.  It was a nice crisp game for us."" 
 Bochy said in February that this would be his last season, and to this point it's hardly been one to savor. San Francisco is in last place, owns the fourth-worst ERA in the NL and hasn't had a winning streak of more than three in a row. 
 The starting pitching has generally been ineffective, but Anderson's performance provided a ray of hope. 
 Sports Videos 
 The rookie right-hander allowed two runs and five hits over seven innings in his fourth big league start. Anderson (1-1) ended a run of 40 consecutive starts of fewer than seven innings by Giants pitchers — the team's longest such streak in the last 100 years. 
 ""He just pitched well. It was good to see that,"" Bochy said. ""The pen needed a big break today. He allowed us to do that."" 
 Obtained in a 2017 trade that sent Eduardo Núñez to Boston, the 24-year-old Anderson pitched in seven games at the Triple-A level this year before making his debut with San Francisco on May 15 against Toronto. His previous three starts with the Giants each were five innings. 
 ""Honestly, I felt good,"" he said. ""I pride myself on going into the seventh inning. This is what I prepared for."" 
 San Francisco scored all its runs off David Hess (1-7). Since throwing 6 1/3 innings of no-hit ball in Toronto on April 1, Hess has gone 0-7 over 10 starts. 
 ""The biggest thing is just not falling behind in the count,"" the right-hander said. ""When I was ahead in the count it obviously made pitching a lot easier."" 
 Belt had a two-run single in the first inning and doubled in two runs during a four-run fifth. Posey ended a run of 50 at-bats without a homer by going deep to right in the third. 
 Renato Núñez hit his 15th home run for Baltimore, the eighth in 12 games. 
 The Orioles were without manager Brandon Hyde, who was attending his daughter's graduation in Illinois. Hyde was replaced by Tim Cossins, the team's field coordinator and catching instructor. 
 ""It was an unbelievable experience,"" said Cossins, whose last managerial gig was in the Florida State League around 2005. ""It's something I'll look back on forever and appreciate."" 
 POMERANZ TO BULLPEN 
 Struggling Giants lefty Drew Pomeranz (1-6, 8.08 ERA) will likely miss at least one start after surrendering eight runs in 1 1/3 innings against the Orioles on Friday night. With an off day Monday, Bochy will shuffle his rotation and send Pomeranz to the bullpen. ""He could help us Sunday, if we needed it,"" Bochy said. 
 TRAINER'S ROOM 
 Giants: Posey tweaked his right hamstring and will be rested Sunday. ... Pitching coach Curt Young was hospitalized Friday night to have his knee drained of infection. He will remain hospitalized through the weekend. ... RHP Trevor Gott (right forearm strain) should be ready to come off the IL on Tuesday, Bochy said. 
 Orioles: OF-1B Mark Trumbo, who's recovering from right knee surgery, was 3 for 13 with a double in three rehab games with Double-A Bowie through Friday. He has yet to play consecutive days. 
 UP NEXT 
 Giants: Jeff Samardzija (2-4, 3.83 ERA) works the finale Sunday after losing his previous three starts. The righty hasn't faced the Orioles since 2015, when he was with the White Sox. 
 Orioles: Gabriel Ynoa (0-1, 5.40) makes his second start since being inserted into the rotation for struggling Dan Straily. Ynoa allowed two runs in four innings against Detroit on Monday.

 Portsmouth 
 When Captain Norman Skinner landed on Sword Beach 75 years ago he carried in his pocket a letter for his beloved wife Gladys and their daughters, a reminder of home and the cause for which he was risking his life. 
 Captain Skinner, of the Royal Army Service Corps, never made it back - killed the next day by a direct hit on his foxhole. 
 But on Wednesday his moving letter will ring out across Southsea Common in Portsmouth to an audience that will include leaders of the countries that came together on D-Day to help liberate Europe from Nazi tyrann y. 
 Prime Minister Theresa May will read Captain Skinner’s letter during an hour-long performance telling the story of that day and featuring testimony from surviving veterans of the Normandy landings.

 In his letter the former insurance worker from Hillingdon, west London, told his wife : “My thoughts at this moment, in this lovely Saturday afternoon, are with you all now. 
 “I can imagine you in the garden having tea with Janey and Anne getting ready to put them to bed. 
 “Although I would give anything to be back with you, I have not yet had any wish at all to back down from the job we have to do.” 
 The 38-year-old's moving words will be heard by the largest gathering of world leaders to be hosted by the UK outside a formal summit since the 2012 London Olympics. 
 It will include President Macron of France, Canada’s Prime Minister Trudeau, Prime Minister Morrison of Australia and President Trump, as well as leaders and senior representatives from New Zealand, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia and Denmark. 
 No 10 said that in keeping with previous D-Day anniversary events Chancellor Merkel of Germany will also attend. 
 The event will feature theatrical performances and live music, culminating in a flypast of 24 new and historic aircraft, including the Red Arrows and a Spitfire. 
 After the display the leaders will join veterans at a reception to pay their respects to those who played a key role in the liberation of Europ e. 
 That evening the 300 veterans – all over 90 years old – will leave Portsmouth on the MV Boudicca, a specially-commissioned ship chartered by the Royal British Legion and escorted by HMS St Albans, to retrace the journey they made across the Channel 75 on June 6 1944. 
 Captain Skinner never lived to see victory over Hitler, but his letter expressed the hopes of many of those who poured onto the D-Day beaches in the face of bullets and shells. 
 “I shall always be grateful to the powers above for having been able to be with you, to have been loved by you,” he told Gladys. “I'm sure I will be with you again soon and for good. Give my fondest love to my Ann and my Janey.”

39608,"Loophole opens World Cup door for lost Wallaby 
 Connal McInerney scored a hat-trick off the bench Saturday as the Brumbies overpowered Japan’s Sunwolves 42-19 to boost their finals chances. 
 The bonus-point victory, punctuated by a perfect six-from-six from the boot of captain Christian Lealiifano lifted the Canberra club above the Rebels at the top of Super Rugby’s Australian Conference with two games left in the regular season. 
 “It’s nice to get the win but we had to work really hard,” said Lealiifano.

 “There’s plenty for us to look at -- obviously in controlling the game a bit better. We got a bit loose and put ourselves under a little bit of pressure so we will learn from it.” 
 The Brumbies were jolted at the start when Hosea Saumaki burst clear to put the Sunwolves ahead in the first minute of their final home game of the season. 
 But the visitors quickly hit back through Peter Samu and Irae Simone, before Thomas Banks ran in a highlight try after a deft kick from Lealiifano had triggered panic in the Sunwolves ranks.

 Semisi Masirewa ran in a superb solo try before the break to reduce the deficit for the home side, only for replacement McInerney to make an instant impact for the Brumbies, twice crashing over after a pair of carbon-copy driving mauls. 
 Masirewa had kept the game interesting, the marauding Fijian setting up Jamie Booth for a third Sunwolves try before McInerney completed his treble with eight minutes left. 
 The Sunwolves, who will be dumped from Super Rugby by competition organisers after next season, once again paid dearly for their ill-discipline as they slipped to a 12th defeat of the year. 
 “Once again it just wasn’t quite good enough,” said Parker, summing up another tough season for the Tokyo-based side. 
 “There were some outstanding bits of play from us and the boys tackled their hearts out. But we struggled around the scrums and with penalties. Credit to the Brumbies -- they’re a really good side and they put us under pressure.”

 TOKYO – Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo has reaffirmed to President Rodrigo Duterte Japan’s commitment to support the Philippines’ peace process in Mindanao and its multi-trillion infrastructure program. 
 “The government of Japan will continue our strong support for projects actively being promoted by the President such as the peace process in Mindanao and infrastructure development,” Abe said in a joint press statement at his office here. 
 ADVERTISEMENT 
 Abe said “Mindanao peace process entered into a new stage with the establishment of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority last February. 
 “In the initial stage, I believe the priority lies in the strengthening of the administrative capacity of the Transition Authority and the facilitation of disarmament of soldiers of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front,” he said. 
 FEATURED STORIES 
 “Japan will strengthen our support attuned to the progress of the peace process so that the people of Mindanao can truly feel and enjoy the peace dividend at the earliest possible time,” he added. 
  
 Build, Build, Build 
 Abe also assured Duterte of his government’s strong support for the Philippine government’s flagship infrastructure project. 
 “Japan is proud to be the largest partner supporting President Duterte’s Build, Build, Build program to actively develop infrastructure. We will continue to strongly support the sustainable economic development of the Philippines through assistance in quality infrastructure,” he said. 
 Abe said Japan welcomes “the decision made by the government of the Philippines to lift the import suspension of fishery products from Fukushima prefecture prior to the Presidential visit to Japan.” 
 He said “safety of agriculture, forestry and fishery products of Fukushima is ensured through thorough inspections and other measures.”

 “Our government will continue to make outmost efforts to push for relaxation or removal of import restrictions imposed by some countries and wipe out the hurtful rumors,” he added. 
  
 Defense cooperation 
 Abel added that the Philippines and Japan will continue to be “strategic partners” and are “closely cooperating in the area of security as well.” 
 “While we will continue to engage in joint exercises and provide support in capacity building, we also intend to deepen our dialogue on the policy front,” he said. 
 “Both being maritime nations,” he said, “Japan and the Philippines share basic values and strategic interests.” 
 “During the course of the meeting this afternoon, we confirmed plans to strengthen our partnership as we confront such challenges as the realization of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific based on the rule of law, full implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions towards the denuclearization of North Korea and early resolution of the abduction issue,” he said. 
 “With another milestone reached today, I look forward to working hand in hand with President Duterte to further deepen the bond of friendship between Japan and the Philippines and to contribute to regional and global peace and prosperity,” Abe added. 
 Abe also congratulated Duterte for his administration’s victory in the May 13 midterm elections. 
 “President Duterte, may I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the overwhelming victory that you had achieved in the recent midterm elections in your Republic,” he said. 
 “The result is a manifestation of the tremendous support shown to the President’s track record during the past three years,” he added. (Editor: Mike U. Frialde)

 CORRECTS SOURCE AND PHOTOGRAPHER'S NAME - St. Louis Blues' Carl Gunnarsson (4), of Sweden, is congratulated by Ivan Barbashev (49), of Russia and Alex Pietrangelo, right, after he scored the winning goal against the Boston Bruins during the first 
 AP Hockey Writer - ST. LOUIS (AP) Tyler Bozak witnessed the first NHL playoff game in Toronto after a seven-year drought. David Perron experienced the first Stanley Cup Final game in Las Vegas. 
 They ain't seen nothin' yet. 
 When the St. Louis Blues host the Boston Bruins in Game 3 on Saturday night, it'll mark the first Stanley Cup Final game in the city in 49 years. That was the night of May 19, 1970, when Bobby Orr scored in overtime, the goal that's immortalized in the most famous photo in NHL history. 
 After winning a final game for the first time in franchise history to tie the series at 1-all, the Blues are trying to make their own history at home. To do so, the least-penalized team in the playoffs that went to the box 10 times in the two games in Boston will need to balance feeding off a raucous crowd and getting too overemotional in that charged atmosphere. 
 ""It's going to be extremely special, for sure, to play in front of the Blues fans that have been waiting for it for a long time,"" Perron said Friday. ""You're trying to keep your sticks close to you so you don't trip guys, you don't high-stick guys and sometimes it's just going to happen. It's not a penalty you're trying to take. It happened to me in the first game, and it's very difficult to take. But you've got to be composed with the puck, you've got to be composed with your stick."" 
 Composure is the Blues' calling card after rallying from the basement of the NHL standings in early January to within three victories of the first championship in franchise history. Their home arena was full for viewing parties for Games 1 and 2, so it's tough for players not to get caught up in the excitement after watching videos of those scenes. 
 ""We're not even here and it's sold out and it's loud,"" Bozak said. ""We're excited."" 
 Fans are certainly excited. NBC Sports reported the highest local rating on cable for a playoff game, StubHub said the price to get in is $725, the average ticket costs $1,068 and demand is outpacing Game 1 in Las Vegas from a year ago. 
 ""This is a hockey town and they've been with us through the ups and downs,"" center Ryan O'Reilly said. ""I don't think I'll be able to describe what it's going to be like. But from what I've seen I've been very impressed, and we're excited to get home to show what this town's about."" 
 To show them good hockey, the Blues must try to avoid the penalty problems that plagued them in Boston. They were whistled for high-sticking, hooking, cross-checking, interference and slashing and twice for tripping and goaltender. 
 Coach Craig Berube, seventh in NHL history with 3,149 penalty minutes mostly for fighting during his playing career, is not happy about his team's lack of discipline so far in the series. St. Louis got here in part because it only took 55 penalties in the first 19 playoff games, and Berube chalks the difference up to too much emotion and harps on it with players because he knows what Saturday night will be like. 
 ""We talk about that a lot,"" Berube said. ""You have to keep your emotions in check."" 
 That won't be a problem for Bruins agitator extraordinaire Brad Marchand , who days ago made it clear he doesn't care what Blues fans think of him. And that works in reverse, too. 
 ""Every arena has roughly the same amount of people in it, so regardless of where you are in the NHL in the playoffs, you expect it to be loud,"" Marchand said. ""I expect the same tomorrow but not overly concerned about the fans. More concerned about the game."" 
 What can happen in the game when Boston's playoff-leading power play goes to work is the main reason the Blues want to avoid penalties. The Bruins have only scored on two of their 10 power plays so far, but they've also used that time to generate momentum. 
 On the flipside, so much time down 5-on-4 also puts wear and tear on the Blues' penalty killers and wreaks havoc on the flow of the game. They'd like to avoid that this time and give their long suffering fans something to cheer about. 
 ""You try not to let the disruption of penalties and power plays affect you whether you're short-handed or on the power play,"" defenseman Robert Bortuzzo said. ""As a player, you just go out and you may be skipped over five shifts because of the disruption or whatnot, but it's easy to get emotionally invested and right back into it when that is the case.""

 Tennant: Yes, of course! 
 Sheen: But ultimately I think the audience would enjoy it much more if they hadn’t seen it [coming, but] in the reveal it’s something they sort of knew in the back of their mind the whole time. 
 Tennant: Yeah, for the whole big trial in Hell and trial in Heaven, I think we bring it out very subtly and then allow that to come through. I think it will make [“Good Omens”] one of the shows that will reward repeated viewings. 
 Setting aside just that particular bait-and-switch bit in the finale, Gaiman — who wrote the series himself and acted as showrunner — told TheWrap that seeing Sheen and Tennant act opposite each other “was like watching two people dancing,” which is rather impressive, as the two have never shared the screen in any significant way before. 
 “Although they’ve known each other for years and they had small parts when young in one film, they had never acted alongside each other because they’re always up for the same parts,” Gaiman told TheWrap. “I loved the fact that I had these two actors. You can never be sure, when you’re mentally casting, whether or not something is going to work, but I was really certain it would.” 
 And here is how the author’s mental casting went down.

We had a very awkward dinner, Michael and I, because he thought that I was going to ask him to play Crowley, and he didn’t really want to. He didn’t think that he could bring anything to it. And I thought that he was expecting me to ask him to play Crowley, because he’s the sexy one in the shades. 
 “He wanted to play Aziraphale and I was there to talk him into playing Aziraphale,” he continued. “As awkward dinners went, we spent half of it having the most awkward as possible dinner, until I went ‘I really want you to play Aziraphale’ and he’s like ‘Oh, good! You have no idea how good that makes this. Of course I would, that’s who I’ve wanted to play!'”

 As for Tennant, Gaiman “can tell you the exact moment” when he knew he wanted to cast him as Crowley. 
 “I was on Episode 3 and I was writing the scene in the church where Crowley has to come down the aisle of the church to rescue Aziraphale,” he said. “And I went, ‘Hang on, if he’s inside the church as a demon he’s gonna be going, ‘Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!’ and sort of dancing the whole time, like somebody on really hot sand at the beach.’ The moment that occurred to me, I thought, ‘You know, David Tennant could do that. And I’m not sure that I can think of anyone else who could do that.'” 
 Oh, if you were ever hoping to see Tennant as Aziraphale and Sheen as Crowley, there is still a chance that could happen — if they adapt “Good Omens” for the stage, that is. 
 “They have been joking from pretty much the first day on set that if we ever do it, a ‘Good Omens’ on the theatrical stage, they want to take it in turns every night, swapping back and forth between Crowley and Aziraphale,” Gaiman said. 
 All six episodes of “Good Omens” are streaming now on Amazon’s Prime Video.

 I doubt this is what Rory Stewart’s detractors had in mind when they called his Tory leadership bid a “pipe dream”. But with the nervous jitters of someone just waiting to be found out, the Old Etonian has offered up the information that he once tried opium at a wedding in Iran . 
 “Somebody passed this pipe around the room and I smoked it — I shouldn’t have done, I was wrong,” he said this week, full of contrition . Although he didn’t, I noticed, miss the opportunity to add that it “had no effect” on him, as he was walking 25-30 miles a day at the time. Or, you know, because he’s just really seriously double hard and definitely the man to lead us through Brexit.

 A video made by Beaumont Animal Care to promote a Memorial Day adoption event is gaining traction on social media after it was picked up by popular short video app ""TikTok."" 
 The shelter used the app to create a video of (presumably) male dogs and cats with musical artist Lizzos's ""Boys"" in the background. 
 A few days later, TikTok's official Twitter account shared the video with the caption ""not sure this is what @lizzo had in mind when she made this song but we're here for it""

47216,"Jurgen Klopp has refused to confirm whether Roberto Firmino will start tomorrow’s Champions League Final , but insisted the Liverpool striker is “ready”. 
 Firmino missed the majority of the run-in after sustaining a groin injury in training, and has been carefully managed in the build-up to this game. 
 But, while Klopp would not offer assurances over his No.9’s starting place at the final press conference to preview the match, he remained upbeat about his fitness. 
 ""Firmino is ready. Whether he will start? I thought I'd keep a few question marks open,” the German said. 
 “He's fit, he's here. Unless anything happens he should be fine [for tomorrow]."" 
 (REUTERS) 
 Should Firmino start, he will be featuring in a “real football final”, according to Klopp. 
 The Reds manager is full of admiration for the work his opposite number Mauricio Pochettino has done and expects the game to be a reflection of that. 
 He added: ""We have two proper football teams in the final. I respect a lot what Poch did.

 “He had a very talented group when he came here. How they have improved has been really impressive.

 Liverpool’s defeat to Real Madrid in last season’s final has given them plenty of motivation going into a second consecutive appearance in the fixture.

90065,"Police had warrant to search journalist's phone before raid 
 Raid may have violated shield law 
 By Rick Hurd 
 Posted: 8:16 AM, June 01, 2019 
 Updated: 8:16 AM, June 01, 2019 
 An image from surveillance footage at Bryan Carmody's home on Friday, May 10, 2019. 
 SAN FRANCISCO - The San Francisco police department obtained a warrant to search the phone of the freelance journalist at the center of a controversy over a leaked report, and were authorized to conduct monitoring on the device months before a raid on his home and office, documents released Friday showed. 
 In a statement emailed to this newspaper Friday, an attorney for the journalist, Bryan Carmody, accused police of obtaining the warrant illegally. Police raided Carmody's home earlier this month after unflattering reports about late San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi were leaked to Carmody, who in turn sold them to news stations.

 Reuters journalists jailed in Myanmar released 
 Adachi died in February and was a staunch critic of police. 
 ""Mr. Carmody received today a previously undisclosed search warrant obtained secretly and illegally by the San Francisco Police Department on March 1, 2019,"" Carmody's lawyer, Ben Berkowitz said in the statement. ""The SFPD appears to have used the illegal warrant to spy on Bryan's movements, phone calls and communications."" 
 Late Friday afternoon, Police Chief Bill Scott announced that he has reached out to outside agencies to take over the investigation ""into the unauthorized release of the Jeff Adachi police report."" 
 ""At the request of San Francisco Mayor London Breed, we are seeking an independent, impartial investigation by a separate investigatory body,"" Scott said. 
 The case has generated controversy, because California has a shield law that protects journalists from being bullied by police into revealing confidential sources. 
 ""This is an alarming and deeply disturbing attack on the free press in an attempt to unmask Mr. Carmody's confidential source,"" Berkowitz said. ""The warrant provided for ongoing surveillance of a journalist. The SFPD's actions are plainly illegal under the First Amendment and California's Shield Law. This is outrageous conduct by the SFPD. We are calling on city officials to hold the SFPD accountable."" 
 Scott addressed the shield law in his statement. 
 ""I am specifically concerned by a lack of due diligence by department investigators in seeking search warrants and appropriately addressing Mr. Carmody's status as a member of the news media,"" Scott said. ""This has raised important questions about our handling of the case, and whether the California shield law was violated."" 
 Scott also said the department will continue its own investigation into the obtaining of the warrant. 
 ""I am committed to leading a department that is transparent, accountable and reflects the values of [San Francisco]. The residents ... our mayor and city leaders, news media and the hardworking men and women of the police department deserve better. We understand that faith in the SFPD has been shaken, and we will work hard to restore it."" 
 Scott last week apologized for the raid, calling it improper. Days earlier, he announced that Carmody was under criminal investigation for conspiring with a police department employee to steal a report about Adachi, saying Carmody ""crossed a line."" 
 Scott made those comments hours after agreeing to return the equipment from Adachi that police seized in the raid. 
 After Scott's reversal and apology, the San Francisco Police Officers Association called for his resignation.

 ISTANBUL – Ankara and Moscow are again facing an escalation of violence in Syria's last rebel-held territory, a development that puts their cooperation to the test even as they support opposing sides in the eight-year war that has devastated Syria. 
 An all-out offensive by Syrian government forces to capture Idlib in northwestern Syria from insurgents could unleash an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, for the area is home to 3 million people. 
 Turkey, which is already hosting more than 3.6 million Syrian refugees, is facing strong pressure from Syria, Iran and Russia to deliver on its pledge to control the armed rebel factions in Idlib. 
 But Turkey also needs Russia to rein in Syrian President Bashar Assad to prevent a massive outflow of refugees and to keep Turkish soldiers on the ground safe.

 SAN DIEGO (AP) — California wildlife authorities say DNA tests confirm that a mountain lion killed in a San Diego County nature preserve this week is the animal that injured a 4-year-old boy hours earlier. 
 The state Department of Fish and Wildlife says Friday a mountain lion genetic profile obtained from samples collected from the boy is identical to the profile of the lion killed by officers. 
 The DNA was extracted from material found clothing and bandages from the boy and from scrapings from the mountain lion's claws. 
 The victim was in a group of 11 adults and children when he was attacked Monday on a trail in Los Penasquitos Canyon Preserve. His injuries were described as head wounds that were not life-threatening.

523,"Premier League: Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri wants to leave club for Serie A champions Juventus, claim reports 
 Sports Agence France-Presse Jun 01, 2019 16:29:27 IST 
 London: Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri has told the club he wants to leave after a single season to join Italian champions Juventus, according to reports on Saturday. 
 File image of Maurizio Sarri. Reuters 
 Sarri has been an uncomfortable fit with fans at Stamford Bridge and despite winning the Europa League this week and finishing third in the Premier League, there is a perception the chain-smoking coach is unwilling to adapt tactics when things go wrong. 
 Sarri has been widely linked with Juventus, who are seeking a successor to Massimiliano Allegri, although sports daily Gazzetta reported Saturday that Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino was also on their radar. 
 Sarri held talks with Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia on Friday and informed her that he wanted to return to his homeland, the reports in Britain and Italy said. 
 Granovskaia, it is said, has promised to talk to club owner Roman Abramovich about his future, but it would seem Chelsea will seek compensation from any suitor. 
 Sarri succeeded Antonio Conte as Chelsea manager last summer after spending three years at Napoli. 
 The 60-year-old enjoyed a tremendous start at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea went unbeaten in 18 games. 
 But Sarri endured consistent criticism from a significant portion of the club's supporters throughout the campaign and suffered heavy 4-0 and 6-0 defeats at Bournemouth and Manchester City. 
 Chelsea, however, reached the Carabao Cup final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester City, before finishing the season strongly. 
 Sarri claimed the first major trophy of his career when Chelsea beat Arsenal 4-1 in Baku on Wednesday to win the Europa League final, but refused to commit his future to the club, saying: ""You know very well that I love the Premier League, the level of the competition, and I am lucky because I am at Chelsea, one of the best teams in the best championship in the world. 
 ""So at the moment I am happy, but of course I want to know if the club is happy, if we can improve. 
 ""It's normal I think; I have a discussion with the owner after every season with every club."" 
 Chelsea are facing a transfer ban next season which could restrict their ability to attract a big name coach. 
 The club have been linked with their former midfielder Frank Lampard, now the manager of Championship side Derby, should Sarri leave Stamford Bridge.

 JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Nick Foles walked off the practice field, paused briefly to take off his jersey and started sprinted to the locker room. He wanted to get home as quickly as possible. 
 Foles spent the last two days practicing with the Jacksonville Jaguars and trying to recover from a gut-wrenching personal loss. 
 Foles' wife, Tori, had a miscarriage last weekend. Foles spoke publicly for the first time following organized team activities Friday and said his wife urged him to return sooner than many expected. 
 ""She knows how important family is to me, but she also wanted me to be here to be with the team,"" Foles said. ""It was really up to her, and she wanted me to come here and be with the team for a little bit. ... 
 ""If my wife needed me at home right now, I'd be at home. That's just me being honest."" 
 Tori Foles was 15 weeks pregnant with the couple's second child when she went into sudden labor Sunday and knew something was wrong. She later found out she had an infection of pneumonia in her blood that caused her to go into premature labor and endure a full delivery. 
 ""I know there are a lot of people that go through this,"" Nick Foles said. ""It's difficult. It's really difficult. It will always be emotional, but ultimately we trust the Lord in this process. We get home to our beautiful baby girl and we hug her even tighter. ... Tori's going through a lot right now. I'm here. The team's been awesome, but when I'm done here, get home to them so we can continue to heal with one another."" 
 × 
 {{featured_button_text}} 
 Foles raved about his wife's resilience. A volleyball player at Arizona, Tori Foles was out of college and working at Nike in 2013 when she was diagnosed with dysautonomia, which affects blood flow through the body and often causes lightheadedness, fainting, blurred vision and an increased heartbeat when standing up. There is no cure. 
 ""She was bedridden, hospitals,"" he said. ""She battles that every single day. Obviously, we've gone so much these last couple of years. We're going through this now. But she's so strong. She's unbelievable."" 
 Tori returned home earlier this week and is taking antibiotics to fight the infection. She is getting help from family members and friends, which helped make it easier for Nick to leave the house, attend practices and continue installing the team's new offense. 
 ""She's the one who said, 'Go, the team needs you right now,'"" he said. ""She knows I'm coming home right away. So that's her. It really is as simple as that. ... It's never going to be, 'Poor me' or anything. It's never that way. She goes through something every day with a chronic illness and she's never going to do that. She's tough. She fights through everything. 
 ""Right now she's continuing to do what she can. She probably moves around too much right now. I know she's going through so many emotions, but that's something we get to go through, and in our relationship and our marriage. It allows us to grow closer and closer together.""
