      " Democratic candidates cyber chat with rural Nevada voters \n",
      " MINDEN, Nev. (AP) - In California, Elizabeth Warren gazed into a laptop camera, resting her chin on her hand while recounting her working-class childhood for about 200 voters scattered hundreds of miles away across Nevada. \n",
      " In Minden, Nevada, about 40 Democrats watched on a small television as Warren delivered parts of her stump speech before fielding her first question, posed by a teacher dialing into the videoconference from a high school library seven hours away in West Wendover. \n",
      " Warren was one of four Democratic presidential candidates pioneering a virtual campaign trail Friday night in rural Nevada. The early voting state has struggled to attract presidential candidates to its far-flung and sparsely populated towns, spurring Nevada Democrats to set up videoconference town halls with candidates. \n",
      " \"This is a way for us to get to see them and let them see us and see that we are here,\" said Janet Walls, a 77-year-old Democrat from Minden. \"Don't forget us.\" \n",
      " Along with Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, author and spiritual leader Marianne Williamson and Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton all participated in the cyber-campaigning Friday, speaking one after another to at least 17 locations around the state. \n",
      " Nevada, the third-in-line state to cast votes on the Democratic presidential nominee, isn't as compact or accessible as New Hampshire, Iowa or South Carolina, where candidates can more quickly and easily visit rural areas. \n",
      " Walls acknowledged the challenges that keep most Democratic presidential candidates from journeying to rural Nevada, where they might be met with a sparse crowd. \n",
      " \"I don't like it, but I understand it,\" she said. \n",
      " Kimi Cole, the chair of the Rural Nevada Democratic Caucus, organized the virtual visits to ensure voters in remote parts of the state can play a role in vetting the party's crowded field of White House hopefuls. \n",
      " It could be a nationwide model as presidential candidates expand the traditional campaign map to seek support in places where Democrats have struggled, including rural America. For the candidates struggling to break out of a crowded Democratic field, rural support could make a vital difference in Nevada's caucuses. \n",
      " Cole said about 200 people tuned in to the cyber-visits from libraries, schools, homes and even a pizza parlor. \n",
      " There were some technical complications, including a few instances where candidates' microphones were accidently muted or their words were drowned out by their own voice echoing across the other screen. But on the whole, voters who participated seemed enthusiastic about the opportunity and asked questions about issues like tribal sovereignty, natural resources and the opioid epidemic. \n",
      " Loretta Kuliawat, 56, compared Booker's cyber appearance to a campaign stop he made in her town last month - the only candidate to visit Minden in person. \n",
      " \"I don't feel any difference between watching him today and being in the room with him,\" she said. She called the virtual visits \"a really nice stopgap\" until the candidates show up in person. \n",
      " Before each candidate signed off, Cole pressed that point with them. \n",
      " \"That doesn't let you off the hook from coming out in person,\" Cole said to Warren. \n",
      " \"It's not a hook! I want to come. I'm ready,\" Warren responded. She then waved goodbye and closed her laptop. \n",

      " The remains of more than 3,000 migrants who died after crossing into the United States have been found in southern Arizona since 2000. The most common cause of those deaths is dehydration, but starvation, exposure and illness kill many, too. And, increasingly, aiding these beleaguered persons by doing anything from stashing water in the desert to sheltering migrants once they arrive is being prosecuted as a crime. \n",
      " The federal felony trial of Scott Warren began Wednesday in Tucson. Warren, an organizer of the volunteer group No More Deaths, is accused of conspiring to smuggle two men who were sheltering in \"the Barn,\" a frequently used aid structure in Ajo, Arizona. He gave them water and food and consulted with medical professionals on their care. He was arrested after his group posted a video of Border Patrol agents pouring out water Warren's group put in the desert for migrants. \n",
      " Warren has not been accused of helping the men to cross, only of aiding them once they arrived. His is a cruel prosecution, of a kind that has become common since then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered federal prosecutors to prioritize harboring cases in 2017. \n",
      " Earlier this year, four people were convicted of abandonment of property and entering the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge without a permit because they left water and other supplies in the desert. \n",
      " Illegal immigration is a serious concern that needs to be addressed, but this battle over whether it is a crime to try to prevent the deaths of humans, many of them women and children, from dehydration, exposure and starvation, things we don't let even murderers suffer, is repugnant. \n",
      " Warren's attorney says part of the defense will be on religious liberty grounds, arguing Warren's faith demands he help these suffering immigrants. That's a powerful argument, because there is no prominent faith or humane belief system that doesn't.\n",

      " U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is taking renewed heat for her past Native American heritage claims — this time from a radio host who compared her to Rachel Dolezal, a former NAACP leader who was found to be a white woman posing as black. \n",
      " Warren was forced to confront her ancestry claims on New York-based radio show “The Breakfast Club” Friday morning, including the DNA test she took last fall that showed she had a Native American ancestor six to 10 generations back. \n",
      " “I’m not a person of color. I’m not a citizen of a tribe, and I shouldn’t have done it,” Warren said. \n",
      " Co-host Charlamagne tha God asked, “If you had a chance to do it over, would you?” \n",
      " Warren said, “I can’t go back,” before pivoting into key issues of her presidential bid, including canceling student loan debt and investing in historically black colleges and universities. \n",
      " But Charlamagne tha God didn’t let the subject drop, questioning how long Warren knew the truth about her ancestry. \n",
      " Warren responded by saying, “Tribal citizenship is an important distinction and not something I am.” \n",
      " Warren was pressed on whether she’d reaped any benefits from her claims — Warren stated on her Texas state bar card registration that she was “American Indian” and long listed herself as a minority in a national law professor directory. Warren responded Friday that a Boston Globe investigation found she didn’t receive any advantages and that “nothing affected any job I ever got.” The Globe report cited denials by people involved in her hiring at Harvard Law School that her minority claim played a role. Harvard University, however, touted Warren as a minority hire in 1996. \n",
      " Rachel Dolezal \n",
      " Charlamagne tha God told Warren, “You’re kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal, a little bit.” \n",
      " Warren, appearing slightly flustered, said, “This is what I learned from my family” before another host cut her a break and changed the subject. \n",
      " Related Story: Rachel Dolezal welfare fraud case leads to felony theft charge \n",
      " Warren has been enjoying somewhat of a resurgence in the polls recently. She’s essentially tied for third with U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, Philadelphia-based Democratic strategist Neil Oxman said, though she remains far behind former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. Her slew of policies had largely replaced discussion of her ancestry, pundits said. \n",
      " “She’s in a period where people are kind of taking a second look at her, and that’s why she’s rebounded somewhat in the polls,” Oxman said. \n",
      " But Oxman said Warren has to learn to handle her ancestry better. \n",
      " “This has got to be the last time she mishandles this stuff,” Oxman said. “This thing defined her, to some degree, for some period of time, and she seems luckily to have gotten away from that. You don’t want this thing to redefine yourself, and so she better figure it out.” \n",
      " Instead of an apology tour, Oxman said Warren should just say “Hey, I’m proud to have whatever percentage of Indian blood I have. I’m proud to have it, and that’s it. You don’t say anything else, ever. You move away from it.” \n",
      " But Massachusetts-based Democratic strategist Scott Ferson said the radio show conversation likely wouldn’t hurt Warren in the long-term. \n",
      " “I would say she’s sort of 93% past it at this point,” Ferson said, adding, “I think the issue is pretty well baked for most people and the people who are going to have a problem with it are people who aren’t supportive of her for other reasons as well.”  \n",

She used her life story, including getting her degree and going to law school after being fired from teaching because she got pregnant, to weave in the rationale for her campaign. \n",
      " “Today, a minimum-wage job will not keep a momma and a baby out of poverty, and that is why I am in this fight,” Warren said. “That difference is not an accident. ... That difference is about who government works for.” \n",
      " Saying the 2020 election “will echo for generations,” Warren summed up her campaign as having three parts: “Attack the corruption, put a little different structure in this economy and protect our democracy.” \n",
      " On a chilly night, the crowd remained attentive throughout the speech, with big cheers for applause lines such as, “Health care is a human right.” \n",
      " Warren was introduced by Sonya Mehta, a former Oakland schoolteacher, who focused on the candidate’s cradle-to-college plans to pay for education. Warren followed up highlighting those plans, drawing applause for her proposal to tax the richest millionaires. \n",
      " Plenty of voters in the crowd were excited about Warren, but still undecided months before the first primary votes will be cast. \n",
      " Amy Neil, 55, a retiree from Albany, was first in line at the event, arriving at 1:30 p.m. \n",
      " Neil says she is drawn to Warren because she has plans to fight the “structural inequities” in society and “can’t be corrupted.” She also liked that Warren is policy-driven. \n",
      " She hasn’t made up her mind, she said — she also likes California Sen. Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — but holds Warren in high regard and was looking forward to hearing from her. \n",
      " Kai Levenson-Cupp, 16, a student from Alameda who will be voting for the first time in November 2020, said Warren is appealing but he remains undecided — wanting in particular to hear about LGBTQ issues and climate change. \n",
      " “I’m going to be a first-time voter in 2020, so I believe it’s very important to see all the candidates in action and see all their stances on all the issues, and just get as much exposure to all of them as possible and be able to make an informed decision,” Levenson-Cupp said. \n",
      " His classmate Sammy Zimmerman said she felt the same way and was also looking to hear about climate change. She’s leaning toward Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Also a first-time voter this election cycle, Zimmerman wants to hear more policy from candidates. \n",
      " “I think in this campaign, a lot of people are running a lot of personality instead of what their actual policies and their actions have been in the past,” Zimmerman said. \n",

      " MINDEN, Nev. (AP) — In California, Elizabeth Warren gazed into a laptop camera, resting her chin on her hand while recounting her working-class childhood for about 200 voters scattered hundreds of miles away across Nevada. \n",
      " In Minden, Nevada, about 40 Democrats watched on a small television as Warren delivered parts of her stump speech before fielding her first question, posed by a teacher dialing into the videoconference from a high school library seven hours away in West Wendover. \n",
      " Warren was one of four Democratic presidential candidates pioneering a virtual campaign trail Friday night in rural Nevada. The early voting state has struggled to attract presidential candidates to its far-flung and sparsely populated towns, spurring Nevada Democrats to set up videoconference town halls with candidates. \n",
      " \"This is a way for us to get to see them and let them see us and see that we are here,\" said Janet Walls, a 77-year-old Democrat from Minden. \"Don't forget us.\" \n",
      " Along with Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, author and spiritual leader Marianne Williamson and Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton all participated in the cyber-campaigning Friday, speaking one after another to at least 17 locations around the state. \n",
      " Nevada, the third-in-line state to cast votes on the Democratic presidential nominee, isn't as compact or accessible as New Hampshire, Iowa or South Carolina, where candidates can more quickly and easily visit rural areas. \n",
      " Walls acknowledged the challenges that keep most Democratic presidential candidates from journeying to rural Nevada, where they might be met with a sparse crowd. \n",
      " \"I don't like it, but I understand it,\" she said. \n",
      " Kimi Cole, the chair of the Rural Nevada Democratic Caucus, organized the virtual visits to ensure voters in remote parts of the state can play a role in vetting the party's crowded field of White House hopefuls. \n",
      " It could be a nationwide model as presidential candidates expand the traditional campaign map to seek support in places where Democrats have struggled, including rural America. For the candidates struggling to break out of a crowded Democratic field, rural support could make a vital difference in Nevada's caucuses. \n",
      " Cole said about 200 people tuned in to the cyber-visits from libraries, schools, homes and even a pizza parlor. \n",
      " There were some technical complications, including a few instances where candidates' microphones were accidently muted or their words were drowned out by their own voice echoing across the other screen. But on the whole, voters who participated seemed enthusiastic about the opportunity and asked questions about issues like tribal sovereignty, natural resources and the opioid epidemic. \n",

      " (WASHINGTON) --  In an interview on “The Breakfast Club” Friday morning, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked a host of questions about her Native American ancestry claims and compared to Rachel Dolezal, the former NAACP leader who was outed as a white woman pretending to be black in 2015. \n",
      " “I grew up in Oklahoma, I learned about my family, the same way most people learn about their family, from my momma and my daddy and my aunts and my uncles, and it's what I believed,” Warren said about her previous claims to be of Native American heritage. \n",
      " “But I'm not a person of color. I'm not a citizen of a tribe. And I shouldn't have done it,” she said. \n",
      " Charlamagne Tha God, a co-host of the morning radio program that has become an increasingly popular platform for candidates looking to reach young, minority voters, asked Warren if she would choose not to take a DNA test to prove her heritage, which she did in October and which was largely criticized by tribes who said DNA was a separate discussion from tribal identity and citizenship. Warren revealed the DNA test after constant attacks from the president, who frequently calls Warren \"Pocahontas,\" a nickname that some critics say amounts to a racial slur. \n",
      " Pocahontas was a historical figure often revered for her role as a Colonial-era emissary. \n",
      " Warren said she couldn’t “go back now,” but that she can “try to be a good partner” moving forward. “I'm not a person of color. I'm not a citizen of a tribe. And tribal citizenship is an important distinction. And not something I am,” Warren said. \n",
      " x \n",
      " Chalamagne then compared Warren to a woman who rose to the headlines in 2015 who claimed she was black and had risen through the ranks at the NAACP. Her parents eventually told the media that she was white. \n",
      " “You're kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal, a little bit. Rachel Dolezal was a white woman pretending to be black,” he said to Warren. \n",
      " “Well, this is just what I learned from my family,” she responded. \n",
      " Warren's campaign did not respond to an ABC News request for comment. \n",
      " The host also asked her if she’d benefited from stating Native American as her heritage, such as writing “American Indian” on a State Bar of Texas registration card in 1986, which the Washington Post reported in February. DJ Envy, another co-host, asked if she had received a discount to go to college, referencing the government’s program for Native American education grants. \n",
      " “Nope. Boston Globe did a full investigation. It never affected – nothing about my family ever affected any job I ever got,” Warren said. \n",
      " Warren was also asked about her past as a Republican, which she was registered as until the late 1990s. \n",
      " “So what made you register as a Republican back then? Because that's the Reagan years, that's the War on Drugs,” Charlamagne asked her. \n",
      " Warren, who has been a pacesetter for policy ideas in the 2020 cycle, said she wasn’t “politically active” during those years and eventually broke into politics to get into “the policy end of it.” \n",
      " Charlamagne said that Warren had “a lot of confusion back in the day” between her Native American heritage and switching political allegiances. \n",
      " “You know, a big part of it was when I got into the fights over — you gotta make the law reflect our values, you gotta have a law that doesn't just work for those at the top and that works for everyone else,” Warren said, circling back to different policies she’s proposed ahead of the 2020 election. \n",
      " In large part, the majority of the nearly hour-long interview was spent discussing Warren’s plans for historically black colleges and universities, which she wants to give $50 billion in grants to, and addressing redlining that held black homeowners back until the 1960s with new affordable housing units. \n",
      " Warren also talked about her support for reparations, though she said she had yet to hear a conclusive decision from experts on the best way for the reparations to be paid to the descendants of those who were enslaved in the U.S. \n",
      " But hours later, it was Dolezal who was trending on Twitter. \n",
      " America Rising, a Republican opposition research PAC, posted the video on their YouTube and was using it to fundraise on Twitter. \n",
      " Warren isn’t the first politician to land in hot water on the show. Earlier this year Sen. Kamala Harris drew criticism when she was asked directly if she ever smoked marijuana. Harris confirmed she smoked, and was asked what music she listened to at the time. \n",
      " Harris said she listened to rappers Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur while she was in college. Both rappers however were not producing music by the time she graduated in 1986. \n",

      " MINDEN, Nev. (AP) — In California, Elizabeth Warren gazed into a laptop camera, resting her chin on her hand while recounting her working-class childhood for about 200 voters scattered hundreds of miles away across Nevada. \n",
      " In Minden, Nevada, about 40 Democrats watched on a small television as Warren delivered parts of her stump speech before fielding her first question, posed by a teacher dialing into the videoconference from a high school library seven hours away in West Wendover. \n",
      " Warren was one of four Democratic presidential candidates pioneering a virtual campaign trail Friday night in rural Nevada. The early voting state has struggled to attract presidential candidates to its far-flung and sparsely populated towns, spurring Nevada Democrats to set up videoconference town halls with candidates. \n",
      " \"This is a way for us to get to see them and let them see us and see that we are here,\" said Janet Walls, a 77-year-old Democrat from Minden. \"Don't forget us.\" \n",
      " Along with Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, author and spiritual leader Marianne Williamson and Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton all participated in the cyber-campaigning Friday, speaking one after another to at least 17 locations around the state. \n",
      " Nevada, the third-in-line state to cast votes on the Democratic presidential nominee, isn't as compact or accessible as New Hampshire, Iowa or South Carolina, where candidates can more quickly and easily visit rural areas. \n",
      " Walls acknowledged the challenges that keep most Democratic presidential candidates from journeying to rural Nevada, where they might be met with a sparse crowd. \n",
      " \"I don't like it, but I understand it,\" she said. \n",
      " Kimi Cole, the chair of the Rural Nevada Democratic Caucus, organized the virtual visits to ensure voters in remote parts of the state can play a role in vetting the party's crowded field of White House hopefuls. \n",

      " It could be a nationwide model as presidential candidates expand the traditional campaign map to seek support in places where Democrats have struggled, including rural America. For the candidates struggling to break out of a crowded Democratic field, rural support could make a vital difference in Nevada's caucuses. \n",
      " Cole said about 200 people tuned in to the cyber-visits from libraries, schools, homes and even a pizza parlor. \n",
      " There were some technical complications, including a few instances where candidates' microphones were accidently muted or their words were drowned out by their own voice echoing across the other screen. But on the whole, voters who participated seemed enthusiastic about the opportunity and asked questions about issues like tribal sovereignty, natural resources and the opioid epidemic. \n",

      " Loretta Kuliawat, 56, compared Booker's cyber appearance to a campaign stop he made in her town last month — the only candidate to visit Minden in person. \n",
      " \"I don't feel any difference between watching him today and being in the room with him,\" she said. She called the virtual visits \"a really nice stopgap\" until the candidates show up in person. \n",
      " Before each candidate signed off, Cole pressed that point with them. \n",
      " \"That doesn't let you off the hook from coming out in person,\" Cole said to Warren. \n",
      " \"It's not a hook! I want to come. I'm ready,\" Warren responded. She then waved goodbye and closed her laptop. \n",

      " Commentary: Democrats must win in rural America - and here's how \n",
      " By Washington Post on May 31, 2019  at 2:46 p.m. \n",
      " Former senators Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., lost their reelection races last year. Looking over the post-election data, Heitkamp told me in a phone interview that there was \"a steady but persistent erosion\" of support for Democratic candidates in the great swath of red America. \"When you look at the numbers, it's hard to win the Senate or potentially the president without getting votes in rural America.\" \n",
      " She stressed that Democrats need to expand their appeal. \"It will be easier to govern,\" she said. Heitkamp warned that no party should have a lock in one geographic area; the result would be polarization and the party with monopoly strength taking voters for granted. \n",
      " That was the genesis for Heitkamp and Donnelly's \"One Country Project,\" which, its website says, \"is dedicated to reopening the dialogue with rural communities, rebuilding trust and respect, and advancing an opportunity agenda for rural Americans.\" The project has three main purposes: building a data center \"on rural opinion, voter makeup, demographics, turnout, long-term trends, and issue salience\"; creating a network to engage rural voters; and developing policy aimed at rural America. \n",
      " Heitkamp rejected the notion that her party has a \"binary choice\" between appealing to rural voters or to urban, blue-state voters. As she put it, the New York cabdriver has the same concerns people in her state do when it comes to \"dwindling pay checks,\" health care and education. The particular solutions may be different - for example, in education, where long distances necessary to get to schools pose special challenges in rural America. \n",
      " She also talked about loss of grocery stores and \"food deserts\" in rural America. \n",
      " What does she recommend Democrats do to attract rural voters? \"You've got to show up, but you can't show up empty-handed,\" she said. Candidates better show up with policy ideas. \n",
      " I asked her if President Donald Trump's supporters feel betrayed by the broken promises on health care and tariff wars. \"I don't think they feel betrayed. The small manufacturing company has been facing cheap imports from China.\" Meanwhile, \"farmers are incredibly aware of trade [issues],\" she said, but they continue to think Trump will open up new markets and they'll be better off in the long run. Heitkamp said solemnly, \"There no proof that is going to happen.\" The real concern should be that when you lose markets, they're usually gone for good. When overseas demand drops, prices plummet. \"That's going to have ramifications for years to come,\" she said. As for trade assistance, farmers are skeptical that the current level of support will continue. Moreover, they'd rather be in business than \"sitting at home getting a check.\" \n",
      " On health care, Heitkamp identified two issues: access and workforce. Keeping rural facilities in place is critical and has everything to do with reimbursements. Medicaid expansion kept many rural health facilities in business; if that gets rolled back, these will disappear. She said that if you look at a map, the availability of rural health care services is highest where Medicaid expansion took place. When Trump's administration joins a lawsuit to destroy the Affordable Care Act, that will \"reverberate throughout rural America,\" she said. The second problem is attracting a skilled workforce that can provide needed services. She pointed to the lack of mental health professionals. A school with a suicidal child may find there is a two-month wait for that child to see a mental health professional, Heitkamp said. \"Rural health care is in crisis.\" \n",
      " Heitkamp was known in the Senate as intensely practical and ready to work across the aisle on issues that affected her state. Her political strategy is similarly down to earth. \"Democrats don't have to win in rural America, they just have to stop losing by so much,\" she said. \n",
      " Democratic contenders should heed her advice. What they may not be able to duplicate, however, is Heitkamp's obvious love and concern for her rural neighbors. She cares intensely about their well being. And empathy is hard to fake, especially when you rarely show up or come empty-handed. \n",
      " Finally, there is a great deal of talk about the need for diversity on the Democratic ticket. \"Diversity\" should also include geographic and professional diversity. If not at the top of the ticket, candidates from the \"heartland\" such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., should be in the mix. The so-called Republican lock on the electoral college and the Senate won't be a lock if Democrats can break the GOP's iron grip on states such as Iowa. Knowing a thing or two about rural broadband, soy bean prices and rural health care would sure help. \n",

      "19675 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren compared to Rachel Dolezal in 'The Breakfast Club' interview \n",
      " Print \n",
      " ABC News Radio \n",
      " Ronen Tivony/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images \n",
      " (WASHINGTON) --  In an interview on “The Breakfast Club” Friday morning, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked a host of questions about her Native American ancestry claims and compared to Rachel Dolezal, the former NAACP leader who was outed as a white woman pretending to be black in 2015. \n",
      " “I grew up in Oklahoma, I learned about my family, the same way most people learn about their family, from my momma and my daddy and my aunts and my uncles, and it's what I believed,” Warren said about her previous claims to be of Native American heritage. \n",
      " “But I'm not a person of color. I'm not a citizen of a tribe. And I shouldn't have done it,” she said. \n",
      " Charlamagne Tha God, a co-host of the morning radio program that has become an increasingly popular platform for candidates looking to reach young, minority voters, asked Warren if she would choose not to take a DNA test to prove her heritage, which she did in October and which was largely criticized by tribes who said DNA was a separate discussion from tribal identity and citizenship. Warren revealed the DNA test after constant attacks from the president, who frequently calls Warren \"Pocahontas,\" a nickname that some critics say amounts to a racial slur. \n",
      " Pocahontas was a historical figure often revered for her role as a Colonial-era emissary. \n",
      " Warren said she couldn’t “go back now,” but that she can “try to be a good partner” moving forward. “I'm not a person of color. I'm not a citizen of a tribe. And tribal citizenship is an important distinction. And not something I am,” Warren said. \n",
      " x \n",
      " Chalamagne then compared Warren to a woman who rose to the headlines in 2015 who claimed she was black and had risen through the ranks at the NAACP. Her parents eventually told the media that she was white. \n",
      " “You're kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal, a little bit. Rachel Dolezal was a white woman pretending to be black,” he said to Warren. \n",
      " “Well, this is just what I learned from my family,” she responded. \n",
      " Warren's campaign did not respond to an ABC News request for comment. \n",
      " The host also asked her if she’d benefited from stating Native American as her heritage, such as writing “American Indian” on a State Bar of Texas registration card in 1986, which the Washington Post reported in February. DJ Envy, another co-host, asked if she had received a discount to go to college, referencing the government’s program for Native American education grants. \n",
      " “Nope. Boston Globe did a full investigation. It never affected – nothing about my family ever affected any job I ever got,” Warren said. \n",
      " Warren was also asked about her past as a Republican, which she was registered as until the late 1990s. \n",
      " “So what made you register as a Republican back then? Because that's the Reagan years, that's the War on Drugs,” Charlamagne asked her. \n",
      " Warren, who has been a pacesetter for policy ideas in the 2020 cycle, said she wasn’t “politically active” during those years and eventually broke into politics to get into “the policy end of it.” \n",
      " Charlamagne said that Warren had “a lot of confusion back in the day” between her Native American heritage and switching political allegiances. \n",
      " “You know, a big part of it was when I got into the fights over — you gotta make the law reflect our values, you gotta have a law that doesn't just work for those at the top and that works for everyone else,” Warren said, circling back to different policies she’s proposed ahead of the 2020 election. \n",
      " In large part, the majority of the nearly hour-long interview was spent discussing Warren’s plans for historically black colleges and universities, which she wants to give $50 billion in grants to, and addressing redlining that held black homeowners back until the 1960s with new affordable housing units. \n",
      " Warren also talked about her support for reparations, though she said she had yet to hear a conclusive decision from experts on the best way for the reparations to be paid to the descendants of those who were enslaved in the U.S. \n",
      " But hours later, it was Dolezal who was trending on Twitter. \n",
      " America Rising, a Republican opposition research PAC, posted the video on their YouTube and was using it to fundraise on Twitter. \n",
      " Warren isn’t the first politician to land in hot water on the show. Earlier this year Sen. Kamala Harris drew criticism when she was asked directly if she ever smoked marijuana. Harris confirmed she smoked, and was asked what music she listened to at the time. \n",
      " Harris said she listened to rappers Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur while she was in college. Both rappers however were not producing music by the time she graduated in 1986. \n",
      " Former Sen. Hillary Clinton was asked on the show what item she always carries with her, her response was hot sauce. \n",

      " ST. LOUIS COUNTY, MINN. - Warren Johnson's trip of a lifetime will begin next week at an airfield in Duxford, England, a small village about 55 miles north of London. \n",
      " The sheriff's deputy from St. Louis County, Minn., will then hop on a C-47 aircraft and fly in formation across the English Channel to Normandy, France, exactly 75 years to the day after Allied troops stormed the Nazi-occupied beaches during a D-Day invasion that changed the course of World War II and human history itself. Johnson and roughly 300 other paratroopers will then jump out of the C-47 planes into the same drop zones the Allied forces used during the early hours of June 6, 1944. \n",
      " It is the same path that Johnson's granduncle, Lambert Johnson, took all those years ago as a member of the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. Lambert and his five brothers, including Warren's grandfather, all served in some capacity during World War II. \n",
      " But Lambert was the only one directly involved in the D-Day invasion. \n",
      " \"I'm doing it to honor him, and what he and his brothers did,\" Warren Johnson said. \"All those guys.\" \n",
      " He leaves for Europe this weekend. \n",
      " FINDING THE PLANE \n",
      " Johnson will add a Minnesota flavor to the 75th-anniversary commemorative event in northwestern France, known as \"Daks over Normandy.\" \n",
      " The young law enforcement officer and Army veteran from northern Minnesota never imagined he would participate in such a prestigious event, but after completing his required parachute training earlier this year, Johnson will board a flight Saturday en route to England. \n",
      " \"It feels kind of surreal now that it's actually happening,\" Johnson said. \"I don't know what it's going to feel like. I honestly can't imagine it.\" \n",
      " Johnson would have never gotten this chance, if not for his own initiative: He began researching his grandfather's family about five years ago, which led him to the story of Lambert's D-Day involvement. Johnson then found his granduncle's unit and even the plane Lambert jumped from in June 1944, with the tail number 43-30732. \n",
      " Johnson traced that plane to Sweden, where he discovered it was still operational seven decades later. He contacted the plane's owner, and then last year he received an email from a plane mechanic who informed him that the C-47 aircraft would be participating in a 75th-anniversary D-Day event in Normandy, France in June 2019. \n",
      " That C-47 aircraft is taking off from that small English village called Duxford. \n",
      " \"Yup, that's the plan,\" Johnson said. \"I'll be jumping out of the same plane.\" \n",
      " Lambert Johnson jumped from this same exact C-47 aircraft in June 1944. It has remained operational. \n",
      " KARE11 \n",
      " The exact same one Lambert Johnson leaped from in the early hours of June 6, 1944, the day Allied forces began to recapture the territory Hitler had invaded four years earlier. \n",
      " \"This one's for you, Gramps,\" Johnson said. \"This one's for you, Uncle Lambert.\" \n",
      " AN UNCANNY RESEMBLANCE \n",
      " Warren Johnson never met his granduncle. Lambert died in 1979, about eight years before Warren was born. \n",
      " Growing up, though, Warren was close with his grandfather, with whom he shares a first and last name. The elder Warren Johnson lived with their family for a few years but rarely spoke about World War II, even though he and all five of his brothers had been involved in the war effort. The memories were still too painful, no matter how many years had passed. All six siblings have since died. \n",
      " Thus, for a long time, the younger Warren knew very little about his grandfather's family during the war years — at least until about five years ago. \n",
      " Around 2014, Warren's second cousin sent him a newspaper article published shortly after World War II ended, detailing the military contributions of the Johnson siblings. The story of his granduncle, Lambert, immediately caught his attention for a number of reasons. \n",
      " A photo of the Johnson siblings: Lambert is on the top left, the elder Warren is on the top right, and the younger Warren is in the middle. \n",
      " KARE11 \n",
      " First of all, unlike his brothers, Lambert had participated in D-Day, an unprecedented invasion and perhaps the most well-known military event in the world. He beamed with pride at the thought of his granduncle risking his life on the shores of northwestern France, playing a pivotal role in the invasion that spurred the liberation of France and eventually helped topple Hitler and the Nazi regime. \n",
      " Beyond that, however, Warren could relate to his granduncle. For starters, they look almost identical in side-by-side photos, which is particularly eerie. They also took similar career paths. Warren himself spent nine years in the Army, including a deployment to Iraq in 2006 before becoming a sheriff's deputy in St. Louis County. Lambert, meanwhile, parlayed his military experience into the job of sheriff in Richland County, North Dakota. \n",
      " \"So just law enforcement, and same branch,\" Warren said, \"I got interested in his story.\" \n",
      " Warren dug deeper and deeper, starting with a simple Google search that revealed Lambert had worked with the 82nd Airborne Division. His research then led him to an expert in New York, who sent Warren a copy of the D-Day manifest for the C-47 plane numbered 43-30732. \n",
      " That's how Warren found the plane that led him to next week's 75th-anniversary event. The manifest also led him to the family members of other soldiers in his granduncle's unit; he was able to track down relatives of five other men who jumped from the same plane. \n",
      " Lambert was the 11th man out the door on June 6, 1944. The ninth man out the door was Private Dominck DiMidio of Newark, New Jersey. He survived well into his nineties, passing away just last year. Before he died, Warren had been in close contact with DiMidio's great-nephew, Lou, who sent Warren the jump wings that Private DiMidio used in June 1944. \n",
      " Warren will carry those wings next week when he leaps from the same plane. Before he died, DiMidio's great-nephew informed him of Warren's plans. \n",
      " \"He knew this was happening,\" DiMidio's grandnephew told Warren, even though DiMidio suffered from dementia. \"He said he was happy we were remembering what they did.\" \n",
      " And Warren is keenly aware of the danger his granduncle and fellow soldiers faced. Lambert Johnson and Dominick DiMidio returned home from Normandy and lived fulfilling lives for many decades, but not everybody did. Through his research, Warren learned that the 10th man to jump from that same plane, Private Herbert Hassell, was among the few thousand Americans who lost their lives on that fateful day of June 6, 1944. \n",
      " BRINGING THE FAMILY TOGETHER \n",
      " Warren's intensive research process led him not only to relatives of his granduncle's unit, but also family members of his own that he may never have otherwise met. All of them will be eager to see Warren participate in the Daks of Normandy next week. \n",
      " That's perhaps the most rewarding part of this whole experience for Warren. Before his research, for example, he did not know many of his extended cousins. \n",
      " \"It's been really cool over the last few years and several months as it's gotten closer,\" Warren said. \"It's connected me with some very distant family that I've never talked to. And it's brought us all together.\" \n",
      " Warren has been in particularly close contact with his granduncle's family. \n",
      " \"His daughter and nephews say he would be very proud,\" Warren said. \"I hope so.\" \n",
      " Lambert Johnson (left) looks strikingly similar to his brother's grandson, Warren (right). \n",
      " KARE11 \n",
      " Warren said the whole family has been extremely supportive. His wife, of course, was a bit nervous about the whole jump-out-of-a-plane aspect. \n",
      " \"But I've done 10 jumps now,\" Warren said, referring to his training in Florida, \"so those worries have been subdued a little bit.\" \n",
      " Next week, of course, will be the real deal. \n",
      " Warren is trying to visualize the experience, but it's difficult for him to anticipate until he arrives on European soil. \n",
      " \"Oh man, I don't know. I can't imagine,\" Warren said. \"It will be a small piece, just a small, small sliver of what it looked like and felt like.\" \n",
      " When Warren lands in Normandy next week, there will be no Axis troops to fight. He will not traverse difficult terrain or endure bullets fired by German soldiers. Lambert Johnson and thousands of American, Canadian and British troops already did that 75 years ago so nobody else would have to do it again. \n",
      " When Warren is finished jumping, he will simply hop a flight home and return to his job as a sheriff's deputy in northern Minnesota. \n",
      " But he knows the experience will change him. \n",
      " \"It's definitely a once-in-a-lifetime, unique opportunity,\" Warren said. \"When I heard about it, I knew I couldn't miss it.\"\n",

      " Share: \n",
      " ABCNews \n",
      " By CHEYENNE HASLETT \n",
      " In an interview on \"The Breakfast Club\" Friday morning, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked a host of questions about her Native American ancestry claims and compared to Rachel Dolezal, the former NAACP leader who was outed as a white woman pretending to be black in 2015. \n",
      " \"I grew up in Oklahoma, I learned about my family, the same way most people learn about their family, from my momma and my daddy and my aunts and my uncles, and it's what I believed,\" Warren said about her previous claims to be of Native American heritage. \n",
      " \"But I'm not a person of color. I'm not a citizen of a tribe. And I shouldn't have done it,\" she said. \n",
      " Charlamagne Tha God, a co-host of the morning radio program that has become an increasingly popular platform for candidates looking to reach young, minority voters, asked Warren if she would choose not to take a DNA test to prove her heritage, which she did in October and which was largely criticized by tribes who said DNA was a separate discussion from tribal identity and citizenship. \n",
      " Warren revealed the DNA test after constant attacks from the president, who frequently calls Warren \"Pocahontas,\"  a nickname that some critics say amounts to a racial slur. \n",
      " Pocahontas was a historical figure often revered for her role as a Colonial-era emissary. \n",
      " Warren said she couldn't \"go back now,\" but that she can \"try to be a good partner\" moving forward. \"I'm not a person of color. I'm not a citizen of a tribe. And tribal citizenship is an important distinction. And not something I am,\" Warren said. \n",
      " Chalamagne then compared Warren to Dolezal who grew up identifying as white but, as an adult, changed her name and chose to identify as a black woman. Using that false racial identity, she rose through the ranks at her local NAACP chapter, taught African American studies at the collegiate level and once claimed to be the victim of a racially motivated hate crime. Her parents eventually told the media that she really was white. \n",
      " \"You're kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal, a little bit. Rachel Dolezal was a white woman pretending to be black,\" he said to Warren. \n",
      " \"Well, this is just what I learned from my family,\" she responded of her family's anecdotal claims of Native American ancestry. \n",
      " Warren's campaign did not respond to an ABC News request for comment. \n",
      " The host also asked her if she'd benefited from stating Native American as her heritage, such as writing \"American Indian\" on a State Bar of Texas registration card in 1986, which the Washington Post reported in February. DJ Envy, another co-host, asked if she had received a discount to go to college, referencing the government's program for Native American education grants. \n",
      " \"Nope. Boston Globe did a full investigation. It never affected - nothing about my family ever affected any job I ever got,\" Warren said. \n",
      " Warren was also asked about her past as a Republican, which she was registered as until the late 1990s. \n",
      " \"So what made you register as a Republican back then? Because that's the Reagan years, that's the War on Drugs,\" Charlamagne asked her. \n",
      " Warren, who has been a pacesetter for policy ideas in the 2020 cycle, said she wasn't \"politically active\" during those years and eventually broke into politics to get into \"the policy end of it.\" \n",
      " Charlamagne said that Warren had \"a lot of confusion back in the day\" between her Native American heritage and switching political allegiances. \n",
      " \"You know, a big part of it was when I got into the fights over - you gotta make the law reflect our values, you gotta have a law that doesn't just work for those at the top and that works for everyone else,\" Warren said, circling back to different policies she's proposed ahead of the 2020 election . \n",
      " In large part, the majority of the nearly hour-long interview was spent discussing Warren's plans for historically black colleges and universities, which she wants to give $50 billion in grants to, and addressing redlining that held black homeowners back until the 1960s with new affordable housing units. \n",
      " Warren also talked about her support for reparations, though she said she had yet to hear a conclusive decision from experts on the best way for the reparations to be paid to the descendants of those who were enslaved in the U.S. \n",
      " But hours later, it was Dolezal who was trending on Twitter. \n",
      " America Rising, a Republican opposition research PAC, posted the video on their YouTube and was using it to fundraise on Twitter. \n",
      " Warren isn't the first politician to land in hot water on the show. Earlier this year Sen. Kamala Harris drew criticism when she was asked directly if she ever smoked marijuana. Harris confirmed she smoked, and was asked what music she listened to at the time. \n",
      " Harris said she listened to rappers Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur while she was in college. Both rappers however were not producing music by the time she graduated in 1986. \n",
      " Former Sen. Hillary Clinton was asked on the show what item she always carries with her, her response was hot sauce. \n",

      " MINDEN, Nev. (AP) — In California, Elizabeth Warren gazed into a laptop camera, resting her chin on her hand while recounting her working-class childhood for about 200 voters scattered hundreds of miles away across Nevada. \n",
      " In Minden, Nevada, about 40 Democrats watched on a small television as Warren delivered parts of her stump speech before fielding her first question, posed by a teacher dialing into the videoconference from a high school library seven hours away in West Wendover. \n",
      " Warren was one of four Democratic presidential candidates pioneering a virtual campaign trail Friday night in rural Nevada.

      " \"I don't like it, but I understand it,\" she said. \n",
      " Kimi Cole, the chair of the Rural Nevada Democratic Caucus, organized the virtual visits to ensure voters in remote parts of the state can play a role in vetting the party's crowded field of White House hopefuls. \n",
      " It could be a nationwide model as presidential candidates expand the traditional campaign map to seek support in places where Democrats have struggled, including rural America. For the candidates struggling to break out of a crowded Democratic field, rural support could make a vital difference in Nevada's caucuses. \n",
      " Cole said about 200 people tuned in to the cyber-visits from libraries, schools, homes and even a pizza parlor. \n",
      " There were some technical complications, including a few instances where candidates' microphones were accidently muted or their words were drowned out by their own voice echoing across the other screen.

      " Wow! Talk about train-wreck radio. During a seemingly uncomfortable interview on the syndicated radio show “ The Breakfast Club ,” the hosts pressed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) also known as Fauxahontas about why she identified as Native American heritage on her Texas bar registration card and at Harvard, and whether she gained anything from it. \n",
      " Warren said it was a mistake and again apologized, explaining that she believed the family stories that were passed down from her parents and extended family. She added that the Boston Globe report found she didn’t benefit from her previous claims in school or when it came to her professional life.“Nothing about my family ever affected any job I ever got,” the senator said. \n",
      " Well, that may not be true. According to The Boston Globe, back in 1984, Warren and members her family contributed recipes to a Native American cookbook, where she signed her name Elizabeth Warren, Cherokee. Then in 1986, Warren listed herself as a “minority” in the American Association of Law Schools’ directory of faculty, which is commonly used by recruiters. In the early 1990s, she was hired by Harvard as a law professor, and the university actually touted Warren’s phony ancestry.  By 1995, once she had achieved tenure, Warren stopped listing herself as a minority. \n",
      " One of the Breakfast Club hosts,  Lenard Larry McKelvey who calls himself “Charlamagne tha God” ”responded to  Fauxahontas,  “You’re kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal a little bit — Rachel Dolezal is the white woman pretending to be black,” he said. \n",
      " Rachel Dolezal made headlines in 2015 when  she resigned as president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  chapter in Spokane, Washington after her white parents came out to say she was falsely claiming to be black. \n",
      " Warren responded to Charlamagne tha God” with, “Well, this is what I learned from my family.” \n",
      " Before she  took a DNA test  that proved that she had less Native American blood than the average American Warren’s proof of her Native American heritage…well, she has  high cheekbones . \n",
      " I still have a picture on my mantel at home, and it’s a picture my mother had before that, a picture of my grandfather. And my Aunt Bea has walked by that picture at least 1,000 times, remarked that he … had high cheekbones like all of the Indians do, because that’s how she saw it. And she said, ‘And your mother got those same great cheekbones, and I didn’t.’ \n",
      " High cheekbones or not, Elizabeth Warren is a fraud, which the Rachel Dolezal comment pointed out. \n",
      " Below is a video of the relevant section of the breakfast club interview (Starting at about the 21:40 mark). \n",

      " Democrats should listen to former red-state senators. \n",
      " Written By: Washington Post | \n",
      " May 31st 2019 - 2pm. \n",
      " Former senators Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., lost their reelection races last year. Looking over the post-election data, Heitkamp told me in a phone interview that there was \"a steady but persistent erosion\" of support for Democratic candidates in the great swath of red America. \"When you look at the numbers, it's hard to win the Senate or potentially the president without getting votes in rural America.\" \n",
      " She stressed that Democrats need to expand their appeal. \"It will be easier to govern,\" she said. Heitkamp warned that no party should have a lock in one geographic area; the result would be polarization and the party with monopoly strength taking voters for granted. \n",
      " That was the genesis for Heitkamp and Donnelly's \"One Country Project,\" which, its website says, \"is dedicated to reopening the dialogue with rural communities, rebuilding trust and respect, and advancing an opportunity agenda for rural Americans.\" The project has three main purposes: building a data center \"on rural opinion, voter makeup, demographics, turnout, long-term trends, and issue salience\"; creating a network to engage rural voters; and developing policy aimed at rural America. \n",
      " Heitkamp rejected the notion that her party has a \"binary choice\" between appealing to rural voters or to urban, blue-state voters. As she put it, the New York cabdriver has the same concerns people in her state do when it comes to \"dwindling pay checks,\" health care and education. The particular solutions may be different - for example, in education, where long distances necessary to get to schools pose special challenges in rural America. \n",
      " She also talked about loss of grocery stores and \"food deserts\" in rural America. \n",
      " listen live \n",
      " watch live \n",
      " What does she recommend Democrats do to attract rural voters? \"You've got to show up, but you can't show up empty-handed,\" she said. Candidates better show up with policy ideas. \n",
      " I asked her if President Donald Trump's supporters feel betrayed by the broken promises on health care and tariff wars. \"I don't think they feel betrayed. The small manufacturing company has been facing cheap imports from China.\" Meanwhile, \"farmers are incredibly aware of trade [issues],\" she said, but they continue to think Trump will open up new markets and they'll be better off in the long run. Heitkamp said solemnly, \"There no proof that is going to happen.\" The real concern should be that when you lose markets, they're usually gone for good. When overseas demand drops, prices plummet. \"That's going to have ramifications for years to come,\" she said. As for trade assistance, farmers are skeptical that the current level of support will continue. Moreover, they'd rather be in business than \"sitting at home getting a check.\" \n",
      " On health care, Heitkamp identified two issues: access and workforce. Keeping rural facilities in place is critical and has everything to do with reimbursements. Medicaid expansion kept many rural health facilities in business; if that gets rolled back, these will disappear. She said that if you look at a map, the availability of rural health care services is highest where Medicaid expansion took place. When Trump's administration joins a lawsuit to destroy the Affordable Care Act, that will \"reverberate throughout rural America,\" she said. The second problem is attracting a skilled workforce that can provide needed services. She pointed to the lack of mental health professionals. A school with a suicidal child may find there is a two-month wait for that child to see a mental health professional, Heitkamp said. \"Rural health care is in crisis.\" \n",
      " Heitkamp was known in the Senate as intensely practical and ready to work across the aisle on issues that affected her state. Her political strategy is similarly down to earth. \"Democrats don't have to win in rural America, they just have to stop losing by so much,\" she said. \n",
      " Democratic contenders should heed her advice. What they may not be able to duplicate, however, is Heitkamp's obvious love and concern for her rural neighbors. She cares intensely about their well being. And empathy is hard to fake, especially when you rarely show up or come empty-handed. \n",
      " Finally, there is a great deal of talk about the need for diversity on the Democratic ticket. \"Diversity\" should also include geographic and professional diversity. If not at the top of the ticket, candidates from the \"heartland\" such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., should be in the mix. The so-called Republican lock on the electoral college and the Senate won't be a lock if Democrats can break the GOP's iron grip on states such as Iowa. Knowing a thing or two about rural broadband, soy bean prices and rural health care would sure help. \n",

      " Elizabeth Warren breaks through crowded 2020 field — with a plan \n",
      " Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced that she is rejecting an invitation from Fox News to participate in a town hall with the network, slamming the outlet as a \"hate-for-profit racket that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracists.\" \n",
      " (CNN) — For five months now, Elizabeth Warren  has bounced around the country pitching ambitious ideas — typically anchored by  well-timed policy rollouts  — to achieve the “big, structural change” at the core of her pitch to Democratic primary voters. \n",
      " Now, with the first round of debates in sight, the energetic campaigner is beginning to see a different kind of movement — in the polls. The latest round of surveys have shown Warren creeping up behind her ideological ally and friend Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator whose campaign is increasingly adapting similar smallball tactics as a way of more directly addressing voters’ questions and concerns. Former Vice President Joe Biden remains the frontrunner by a comfortable margin, but in the race to represent the party’s more liberal wing, Warren is quietly on the rise. \n",
      " Her slow-burn campaign began on the last day of last year with modest fanfare, at least by comparison to the kind of attention initially dedicated to rivals like Beto O’Rourke, who dominated the will-he-won’t-he headlines with a stream of journal entries and, eventually, a glossy magazine debut in March. But the opening slog of the primary, which still has about 8 months to run before the Iowa caucuses, gave Warren a chance to sharpen her trade — and help her emerge in a way few predicted: as a cultural figure bolstered by a kind of meme-friendly fandom all candidates long for, but only a handful achieve. \n",
      " The Massachusetts senator’s schedule is meticulously drawn, but her interactions with those who come to see her is, apart from a quick pitch that shows up in almost every appearance, mostly unscripted. At town halls from Iowa and New Hampshire to less traveled campaign trails in Tennessee and Alabama, Warren has been grinding away, taking questions and, famously, selfies — literally tens of thousands of them. \n",
      " That appeal, typically confined to modest-sized “organizing events,” has begun to spill over into social media, pop culture and the national press. During her Thursday morning appearance on “The View,” an audience member held up a small flag reading, “Warren has a plan for that.” She appeared on Time magazine’s cover with those words — “I have a plan for that” — in headline print alongside her face, which looked on heroically to some distant horizon. For those paying attention — and especially the voters, according to a recent  Quinnipiac poll  question, paying “a lot” of it — the message seems to be landing. She was the only candidate other than Biden (42%) who registered double-digit support, at 15%. \n",
      " Warren has embraced the broader, and perhaps unexpected, new interest. \n",
      " “I have a plan” has become a reliable applause line at rallies, and she delivers it reliably, along with snippets of an autobiography that the former Harvard professor, as well as anyone else in the contest, naturally connects to explanations of her policy proposals. The selfie lines, and her dog, Bailey, have drawn untold likes on social media, and yes, that was a  Warren 2020 bumper sticker  on a car driven by the young female protagonists in the new movie, “Booksmart.” \n",
      " In front of a national audience on “The View,” Warren showed off her knack for serving up a complicated policy in a digestible bite. Speaking about her childcare plan, Warren said “this one is really personal for me” before recalling her time as a young mom who was bailed out by her “Aunt Bee,” who rushed to her rescue so many years ago after a tearful phone call and then, after arriving a couple days later, “stayed for 16 years.” \n",
      " “And that’s how I made it through,” Warren said. “If all of America had an Aunt Bee, we’d be in a different place, but childcare has gotten even harder, and holds women (and) some men back from getting an education, and getting into the workforce and taking a more demanding job.” \n",
      " At that, Warren pivoted back to her proposal, and directed viewers to her website, which now has a feature that allows people to calculate — based on where they live, their income and how many kids they have, or plan on having — just how much they stand to save if her plan became law. A lot more would change if even a handful of her  big ticket proposals  — some original, some of them revamped or repackaged past legislation — came to life. Warren wants to enshrine broad new anti-corruption laws; break up big tech; cancel nearly all student debt; make higher education, like childcare, almost entirely free; make housing more affordable by changing zoning laws; place a moratorium on fossil fuel drilling by executive order; and create an incentive-laden system to encourage medical providers to drive down maternal mortality rates. To start. She would pay for the more expensive stuff, she says, with her wealth tax. \n",
      " But if Warren can, at times, seem to have answers to all the worries a voter can name, there are other, less high-minded questions she must still address. \n",
      " Her organization is large and, so far, functions with an apparent ease that matches the candidate’s bearing. But it is also expensive and Warren, through the first quarter of 2019, struggled to raise the kind of money candidates like Sanders, O’Rourke and California Sen. Kamala Harris have attracted. She has a hefty Senate campaign bankroll to fall back on, but her decision to refuse money from all political action committees and other big donors — the kind embraced by Biden, most notably — could circumscribe how and where she campaigns later on. \n",
      " Warren’s advisers have been tight-lipped about the questions centering on whether she can raise enough money to sustain the expansive organizing operation in Iowa and other early-voting states. After swearing off attending those high-dollar fundraising events this spring, she is relying solely on online donations. \n",
      " A longtime supporter and donor close to the campaign said fundraising has picked up during the last two months as Warren has drawn more attention through the flurry of policy proposals, television appearances and aggressive campaign schedule. She raised $6 million in the first quarter of the year, but the campaign has set a goal of at least $8 million for the second quarter, which she is on track to meet or exceed, a Democrat close to Warren said. \n",
      " “Things have looked up in the second quarter,” the Democrat said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss fundraising goals, who added that fundraising remains one of Warren’s biggest hurdles. \n",
      " She will not, however, be hampered by an unwillingness to spar with Biden, even as he does his best to remain above the primary fray by saving his shots for President Donald Trump, who has aided that strategy by insulting Biden when the opportunity presents itself. \n",
      " Warren welcomed Biden to the primary back in April by highlighting their decades-old rivalry, which traces back to a feud over bankruptcy laws. Their fight — well-documented then and now — was rooted in issues of economic fairness that are likely to resonate with Democrats in 2020. \n",
      " “I got in that fight because (families) just didn’t have anyone,” Warren said of their dispute over a major bankruptcy bill, “and Joe Biden was on the side of the credit card companies.” \n",
      " Only Sanders, who is keen to position himself as the progressive alternative to Biden, has drawn more stark contrasts with the former vice president. Whether the primary ends up pitting Sanders and Warren against one another for the support of the Democratic left — and the risks that entails for a movement that has, at times, claimed both of them as its own — is a question both campaigns have yet to face. \n",
      " For now, though, the blinders are on and the march continues. Warren has already visited 18 states and Puerto Rico — and will add two more next week, when she goes to Indiana and Michigan to talk about the economic future of the Upper Midwest and, presumably, her “plan for that.” \n",

      " The plan includes rolling back long-standing Justice Department policy that forbids charging a sitting president with a crime. \n",

      " The plan includes rolling back long-standing Justice Department policy that forbids charging a sitting president with a crime. \n",
      " Just two days after Robert Mueller’s unexpected press conference — one in which he said that charging a sitting president with a crime was “not an option,” based on Justice Department rules — Sen. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a new plan which would roll that policy back. \n",
      " On Friday morning, Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, called on Congress to pass a law which would allow for a sitting president be indicted. Should she win the presidency, she vowed to appoint Justice Department officials that would make sure of it. \n",
      " Her plan comes on the heels of a new wave of Democrats calling for President Donald Trump’s impeachment after Mueller’s bombshell presser. \n",
      " “Mueller’s statement made clear what those of us who have read his report already knew: He’s referring President Trump for impeachment, and it’s up to Congress to act,” Warren wrote in a post published to Medium . \n",
      " “But impeachment isn’t supposed to be the only way that a President can be held accountable for committing a crime,” Warren added. “That’s why I’ve got a plan to make sure that no President is above the law.” \n",
      " According to The Hill , Warren’s plan would include legislation that would make charging a current president with a crime a lawful action, on top of amending obstruction of justice statutes that would allow the same. \n",
      " Her goal, she wrote, is to make sure that a president can be charged — just like any other government official. The plan essentially gives an additional government entity, the Department of Justice, the power to hold a president accountable for alleged crimes. \n",

      " — The Hill (@thehill) May 31, 2019 \n",
      " Warren railed against Trump in her post, charging that the president used the Justice Department to help him get away with a crime. “That’s not how our country is supposed to work,” she said. \n",
      " She also points out that previous lawyers for past presidents have argued that the only way a president can be held accountable for potential wrongdoing is through impeachment, but also that “constitutional experts” have criticized that argument. \n",
      " Loading... \n",
      " Warren also accused Attorney General William Barr of acting like Trump’s personal defense attorney, claiming “he disgraced himself” in the process. Other Democrats have echoed that statement, and have implied that there’s good reason Barr was hand-picked by the president. \n",
      " The 2020 presidential candidate doubled down regarding her plan’s conclusion. \n",
      " “No matter what he may think, Donald Trump is not a King. No President is. And our democracy only works if everyone can be held accountable. These changes will make sure that’s the case for generations to come,” she wrote. \n",
      " Warren, who has used similar policy plan proposals as part of her presidential bid, currently sits in fourth place in the Democratic primary race, per RealClearPolitics data. \n",

      " Democratic candidates cyber chat with rural Nevada voters \n",
      " By Michelle L. PriceThe Associated Press \n",
      " Sat., June 1, 2019 \n",
      " MINDEN, Nev. - In California, Elizabeth Warren gazed into a laptop camera, resting her chin on her hand while recounting her working-class childhood for about 200 voters scattered hundreds of miles away across Nevada. \n",
      " In Minden, Nevada, about 40 Democrats watched on a small television as Warren delivered parts of her stump speech before fielding her first question, posed by a teacher dialing into the videoconference from a high school library seven hours away in West Wendover. \n",
      " Warren was one of four Democratic presidential candidates pioneering a virtual campaign trail Friday night in rural Nevada. The early voting state has struggled to attract presidential candidates to its far-flung and sparsely populated towns, spurring Nevada Democrats to set up videoconference town halls with candidates. \n",
      " “This is a way for us to get to see them and let them see us and see that we are here,” said Janet Walls, a 77-year-old Democrat from Minden. “Don’t forget us.” \n",
      " Along with Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, author and spiritual leader Marianne Williamson and Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton all participated in the cyber-campaigning Friday, speaking one after another to at least 17 locations around the state. \n",
      " ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW \n",
      " Nevada, the third-in-line state to cast votes on the Democratic presidential nominee, isn’t as compact or accessible as New Hampshire, Iowa or South Carolina, where candidates can more quickly and easily visit rural areas. \n",
      " Walls acknowledged the challenges that keep most Democratic presidential candidates from journeying to rural Nevada, where they might be met with a sparse crowd. \n",
      " “I don’t like it, but I understand it,” she said. \n",
      " Kimi Cole, the chair of the Rural Nevada Democratic Caucus, organized the virtual visits to ensure voters in remote parts of the state can play a role in vetting the party’s crowded field of White House hopefuls. \n",
      " It could be a nationwide model as presidential candidates expand the traditional campaign map to seek support in places where Democrats have struggled, including rural America. For the candidates struggling to break out of a crowded Democratic field, rural support could make a vital difference in Nevada’s caucuses. \n",
      " Cole said about 200 people tuned in to the cyber-visits from libraries, schools, homes and even a pizza parlour. \n",

      " Turns out the people of Oakland, Calif. love plans. Or, at least, the 6,500 people who showed up to presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren ’s town hall sure do. Warren, the “I have a plan for that” candidate drew an impressive crowd at Oakland’s Laney College. As one attendee, Rachel Johnson-Farias, told the San Jose Mercury News , “She’s the only politician right now with a concrete plan—and she has a concrete plan for everything.” \n",
      " Crowds wrapped around the block and the event start was delayed by an hour to allow everyone in. The political event was the largest in Oakland since Kamala Harris’s campaign kick-off that drew a crowd of 20,000 . And according to Warren, it was her largest event in the country so far, and it comes on the heels of news that she is gaining ground in national polls . \n",
      " Although the candidate did not take questions from attendees because of the late start, she addressed topics she said came up frequently at her other town halls, including gun control. \n",
      " “It’s not just the mass shootings. It’s the ones that never make the headlines. It’s the kids who are shot at the playground, on the sidewalk, in their own homes. Gun violence touches families every day,” she said. “On the question of gun violence, I will be fearless. We will be side by side and we will protect our children.” \n",
      " She also talked about the corrupting power of money in politics and government, one of her big issues: “Here’s the deal: When you’ve got a government that works great for those with money, works great for those who can hire an army of lobbyists and lawyers, works great for those at the top, but isn’t working for the rest of the people, that is corruption pure and simple and we need to call it out,” she told the crowd. \n",
      " “I’m coming back to Oakland,” Warren said before staying late to take selfies with attendees, which has become a tradition at her town hall events.\n",

      " Elizabeth Warren drew a packed crowd in Oakland on Friday night in her first trip to the Bay Area as a Democratic presidential candidate, garnering big applause with her part autobiographical, part policy stump speech. \n",
      " “Here’s the deal: When you’ve got a government that works great for those with money, works great for those who can hire an army of lobbyists and lawyers, works great for those at the top, but isn’t working for the rest of the people, that is corruption pure and simple and we need to call it out,” the Massachusetts senator said. \n",
      " A long line to see Warren formed hours before her appearance at Laney College, where her scheduled “town hall” speech was moved from a 2,000-seat gym to a soccer field that could hold a crowd that eventually totaled several thousand. \n",
      " “I’m coming back to Oakland,” Warren said, declaring that this was her largest town hall to date out of 90 that she has held since becoming a candidate. \n",
      " But after starting about an hour late, she also said she would not be taking questions as planned. \n",
      " Warren kicked off with an autobiographical introduction, talking about her “momma” and “daddy” and brothers growing up in Oklahoma. She spoke about her mother getting a minimum-wage job to save their house after her father’s heart attack. She used her life story, including getting her degree and going to law school after being fired from teaching because she got pregnant, to weave in the rationale for her campaign. \n",
      " “Today, a minimum-wage job will not keep a momma and a baby out of poverty, and that is why I am in this fight,” Warren said. “That difference is not an accident. ... That difference is about who government works for.” \n",
      " Saying the 2020 election “will echo for generations,” Warren summed up her campaign as having three parts: “Attack the corruption, put a little different structure in this economy and protect our democracy.” \n",
      " On a chilly night, the crowd remained attentive throughout the speech, with big cheers for applause lines such as, “Health care is a human right.” \n",
      " Warren was introduced by Sonya Mehta, a former Oakland schoolteacher, who focused on the candidate’s cradle-to-college plans to pay for education. Warren followed up highlighting those plans, drawing applause for her proposal to tax the richest millionaires. \n",
      " Plenty of voters in the crowd were excited about Warren, but still undecided months before the first primary votes will be cast. \n",
      " Amy Neil, 55, a retiree from Albany, was first in line at the event, arriving at 1:30 p.m. \n",
      " Neil says she is drawn to Warren because she has plans to fight the “structural inequities” in society and “can’t be corrupted.” She also liked that Warren is policy-driven. \n",
      " She hasn’t made up her mind, she said — she also likes California Sen. Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. — but holds Warren in high regard and was looking forward to hearing from her. \n",
      " Kai Levenson-Cupp, 16, a student from Alameda who will be voting for the first time in November 2020, said Warren is appealing but he remains undecided — wanting in particular to hear about LGBTQ issues and climate change. \n",
      " “I’m going to be a first-time voter in 2020, so I believe it’s very important to see all the candidates in action and see all their stances on all the issues, and just get as much exposure to all of them as possible and be able to make an informed decision,” Levenson-Cupp said. \n",
      " His classmate Sammy Zimmerman said she felt the same way and was also looking to hear about climate change. She’s leaning toward Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Also a first-time voter this election cycle, Zimmerman wants to hear more policy from candidates. \n",
      " “I think in this campaign, a lot of people are running a lot of personality instead of what their actual policies and their actions have been in the past,” Zimmerman said. \n",

      " Cole said about 200 people tuned in to the cyber-visits from libraries, schools, homes and even a pizza parlor. \n",
      " There were some technical complications, including a few instances where candidates' microphones were accidently muted or their words were drowned out by their own voice echoing across the other screen.

      " It was the day when a politician of wealth and white privilege was shot down by the blacks that she was pandering to for their votes and it was magnificent. \n",
      " Confessed fake Indian Elizabeth Warren dropped by the popular SJW radio show Breakfast Club where she pitched her socialist ideas and looked to con black folks into thinking that she actually gives a rat’s ass about them as she struggles to keep up in the run for the Democrat nomination. \n",
      " Things were going relatively well until Pocahontas was confronted by co-host Lenard Larry McKelvey aka Charlamagne Tha God over her ancestry hoax and it didn’t go very well as Warren struggled to explain away decades of lies to advance her career only to be compared to hoaxster Rachel Dolezal. \n",
      " People might remember Dolezal as the former head of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP who falsified her race setting off a major scandal that cost her the gig. She also recently copped a plea in order to avoid standing trial on welfare fraud. \n",
      " But the key word here is fraud and just as Senator Warren was exposed as a phony when she touted a DNA test last year that backfired spectacularly by concluding that she was about 1/1,024 percent Native American, she will never be able to scrub that stain from her legacy. \n",

      " Transcript via Real Clear Politics : \n",
      " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was grilled for her claims of Native American ancestry by the hosts of ‘The Breakfast Club,’ DJ Envy, Angela Yee, and Charlamagne Tha God, with Charlamagne Tha God asking, “when did you find out you weren’t?” \n",
      " “I grew up in Oklahoma. I learned about my family the same way most people learn about their family, from my momma and my daddy and my aunts and my uncles, and it’s what I believed. But I’m not a person of color. I’m not a citizen of a tribe, and I shouldn’t have done it,” Warren explained. \n",
      " “How long did you hold on to that, because there were some reports that said you were Native American on your Texas bar license and that you said you were Native American on some documents when you were a professor at Harvard?” Charlamagne Tha God asked. \n",
      " “Like, why’d you do that?” he added. \n",
      " “So, it’s what I believed. You know, that’s like I said, it’s what I learned from my family,” Warren said. \n",
      " “When did you find out that you weren’t?” the host pressed. \n",
      " “Well, it’s — I’m not a person of color. I’m not a citizen of a tribe, and tribal citizenship is an important distinction and not something I am,” Warren replied. \n",
      " “Were there any benefits to that?” Charlamagne Tha God asked. \n",
      " “No, the Boston Globe did a full investigation,” Warren answered. “It never affected, nothing about my family every affected any job I ever got.” \n",
      " “You’re kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal, a little bit. Rachel Dolezal was a white woman pretending to be black,” Charlamagne Tha God said. \n",
      " Looks like Pocahontas is already in heap big trouble and is battling with the likes of Beto and Mayor Pete while choking on Biden’s dust.\n",

      " Tweet \n",
      " The most prominent Millennial legislator may be bailing on the man who paved the way for her stardom. According to a report in the Washington Examiner, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who is a self-described democratic socialist, will not endorse the nation’s leading socialist for president. \n",
      " Instead, she’s reoortedly considering backing Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. \n",
      " Warren has been staging a comeback of sorts these last few weeks, crushing Sanders from behind and pulling from his base of support, just as former Vice President Joe Biden increases his lead over the longtime Vermont senator in certain key primary states. Once behind by double digits, Warren has moved comfortably into third place in the 2020 Democratic primary, commanding comfortable double-digit favorability ratings in both national and state-based polls. \n",
      " In one particularly astounding Quinnipiac University poll, reported Tuesday by The New York Times, Warren was listed as the favorite candidate of those describing themselves as “very liberal,” beating Sanders by a whopping 8 points in a race he might have very easily won just weeks ago. \n",
      " She’s also been cozying up to Ocasio-Cortez, imitating Ocasio-Cortez’s social media strategy and appearing in videos with the freshman New York congresswoman discussing things like “Game of Thrones.” \n",
      " The pandering is paying off, the Examiner says, and Warren anticipates earning Ocasio-Cortez’s official seal of approval, even if Ocasio-Cortez is much closer on the policy spectrum to Sanders. \n",
      " “One longtime Warren watcher said that it appears the senator’s campaign to win the official endorsement from the darling of progressives is on track,” the Examiner reports, adding that the “coveted” endorsement “could be the coup d’état for the heart and soul of the restless left wing base Warren is courting.” \n",
      " Ocasio-Cortez has also stepped up to defend Warren from criticism, even when it means compromising her basic progressive values. Last week, Warren was the target of a hit piece that took aim at her legal career, revealing that she, at one time, charged in excess of $600 per hour to serve as a consultant on certain cases. Ocasio-Cortez rode to her side, chastizing the piece’s author (who was a woman) for her cheap shot (and her sexism, to boot). \n",
      " This week, Ocasio-Cortez endorsed a plan to break up tech companies — and specifically social media companies — that’s been Warren’s legislative baby for years. \n",
      " Unless things change dramatically, Sanders and Biden are the most likely competitiors for the top of the 2020 Democratic presidential ticket, with Joe Biden clearly — at this point — the favorite. \n",
      " But both sects competing for control of the Democratic party — the more moderate left that believes a populist is better situated to take on President Donald Trump, particularly in the midwest, and the progressive left that wants a dynamic candidate with policy ideas easily distinguishable from Trump’s — seem to recognize that some compromise must happen to maximize the Democrats’ chances of winning. That may mean trading the unapologietically far-left Sanders as the party’s nominee for the similarly far-left but wonkier-sounding Warren for vice president. \n",
      " Warren is, of course, no less threatening to economic stability than Sanders, but it’s also not clear that the Democratic party can run two white men on a ticket in 2020. After years of identity politics, it’s simply not an option. \n",

      " According to Warren's campaign, roughly 6,500 people attended the event held on the soccer field at Laney College. The event was billed as a town hall where Warren would take audience questions, but because of a late start-- which the campaign said was because of the crowd size-- Warren skipped that portion and instead stayed late meeting with voters and taking selfies. \n",
      " The Massachusetts senator appeared to be introducing herself to California voters. She went through her campaign stump speech-- talking about her childhood, her family and career path, as well as her key progressive policies, including universal childcare, Medicare for all and government corruption. \n",

      " Government | May 31, 2019 \n",
      " Nevada Appeal staff report \n",
      " The Nevada Senate approved a pair of measures to raise the minimum wage on Friday. One of the bills, AB456, sponsored by Speaker of the Assembly Jason Frierson, enacts a gradual increase of the minimum wage up to $12 per hour. \n",
      " The bill passed with a 13-7 vote, with Sen. Keith Pickard joining the Democratic senators in bipartisan support. The resolution, AJR10, amends the Nevada Constitution to change the Nevada minimum wage to $12 an hour, regardless of health benefits offered. AJR10 passed the Senate 12-8. \n",
      " Executive Director of Battle Born Progress Annette Magnus issued the following statement: \n",
      " “We are thrilled to see the Senate pass both AB456 and AJR10 to raise the minimum wage, benefiting approximately 300,000 workers. AB456 is a good first step toward building a Nevada where workers are treated with dignity and compensated fairly. Minimum wage workers in this state have gone 10 years without a raise, severely impacting their ability to pay for basic necessities or support a family.” \n",
      " AB456 requires the minimum wage rise by 75 cents per year, beginning in January 2020 until the minimum wage is $12 per hour. \n",
      " AJR10, also sponsored by Frierson, proposes removing the provisions of the Nevada Constitution allowing an employer to pay less than the minimum wage if health benefits are offered, allows Nevada to set a higher minimum wage if the federal minimum wage is increased, and sets the Nevada minimum wage at $12 per hour beginning July 1, 2024. \n",
      " The Assembly passed the two bills earlier this week, meaning the bills will go to Gov. Steve Sisolak to sign into law. \n",

      " Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren visits Iowa \n",
      " More \n",
      " WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren called on Friday for Congress to pass a law that makes it clear the Justice Department can criminally indict a sitting president and charge the U.S. leader with obstructing justice. \n",
      " \"No president is above the law,\" Warren said in a statement released by her campaign. \"Congress should make it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice.\" \n",
      " Warren's call came in response to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's 448-report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and his statement this week that Justice Department policy prevented him from bringing charges against a sitting president. \n",
      " Mueller's report concluded that Russia repeatedly interfered in the 2016 election and that Trump's election campaign had had multiple contacts with Russian officials, but did not establish a criminal conspiracy with Moscow to win the White House. \n",
      " It declined to make a judgment on whether Trump obstructed justice, although it outlined 10 instances in which Trump tried to have Mueller fired or otherwise impede the investigation. \n",
      " \"When the federal government tried to investigate, Donald Trump did everything he could to delay, distract and otherwise obstruct that investigation,\" Warren's statement said. \"That's a crime. If Donald Trump were anyone other than the president of the United States, he would be in handcuffs and indicted.\" \n",
      " Warren urged Congress to pass a law making it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice. She also said statutes relating to such obstruction should be amended to allow for indictment when a president abuses the powers of office. \n",
      " Warren criticized Trump's attorney general, William Barr, saying he had \"acted like Trump's personal defense attorney.\" \n",
      " She promised that if she is elected, she would ensure her appointees reverse a Justice Department opinion that argues a sitting president cannot be indicted. \n",
      " \"Donald Trump is not a king. No president is. And our democracy only works if everyone can be held accountable,\" Warren said. \n",

      " Louisville homeowner fools porch pirates with clever 'bait box' \n",
      " Save \n",
      " LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- You could say James Warren is an expert fisherman who uses some very unusual bait. \n",
      " \"We get a lot of random stuff that goes for the bait,\" he said with a smile. \"I call it a bait box, and it seems to be way too successful.\" \n",
      " His bait is an old Amazon box. The result of a good day of fishing for Warren? Catching a potential porch pirate on camera for the whole neighborhood to see. \n",
      " The hobby started a couple years ago after a few of his packages were nabbed off his Old Louisville condo's porch. \n",
      " \"We did accidentally have a package shipped here which was actually Bibles, and within ten minutes of the mail carrier dropping it on the porch, someone came and stole them,\" Warren said. \n",
      " He'd had enough. The Ring Video Doorbell he got for Christmas didn't stop the problem alone, so he got creative. He used a hidden metal wire to secure a decoy package to his porch. When a would-be porch pirate tries to remove the package, it budges just enough to reveal a small sign: \"Hello package thief. You are on camera.\" Meanwhile, his motion-activated Ring camera records the whole affair. \n",
      " \"You can see the metal wire's a little banged up from being messed with so many times,\" Warren said as he showed off the decoy. \"It just goes to a carabiner, so they can't actually take off with it.\" \n",
      " Even if someone manages to swipe the box from the porch, he or she is in for yet another surprise. The box contains some less-than-desirable items like a cinder block, some discarded pistachio shells, or a clothes hanger. \n",
      " \"I've seen them curse,\" Warren said. \"I've seen them throw their hands up and stomp off or just shake their head and sigh.\" \n",
      " The bait has attracted plenty of fish. \n",
      " \"I've had this going now for a year and a few months, and I've probably had over a couple hundred attempts at the box,\" Warren said. \"Sometimes, it's multiples in a day. This past Saturday, there were four different ladies that tried.\" \n",
      " Warren said even though police haven't acted on his videos so far, he hopes they will someday. However, even if they don't, he considers what he's doing as a high-tech version of a neighborhood watch. \n",
      " \"I'm not looking for any kind of financial gain off of this,\" he said. \"I just want to help my neighbors.\" \n",
      " He posts the videos to Nextdoor, Facebook, YouTube and LiveLeak. His YouTube channel, Don't Touch My Box , shows dozens of videos. \n",
      " Warren doesn't find the videos humorous. He finds them sad. \n",
      " \"When did everyone say it's OK to go on somebody else's porch and take their stuff?\" he asked. \n",

      "71756 COMMENTARY: Democrats must win in rural America - and here's how \n",
      " Democrats should listen to former red-state senators. \n",
      " Written By: Washington Post | \n",
      " May 31st 2019 - 2pm. \n",
      " Former senators Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., lost their reelection races last year. Looking over the post-election data, Heitkamp told me in a phone interview that there was \"a steady but persistent erosion\" of support for Democratic candidates in the great swath of red America. \"When you look at the numbers, it's hard to win the Senate or potentially the president without getting votes in rural America.\" \n",
      " She stressed that Democrats need to expand their appeal. \"It will be easier to govern,\" she said. Heitkamp warned that no party should have a lock in one geographic area; the result would be polarization and the party with monopoly strength taking voters for granted. \n",
      " That was the genesis for Heitkamp and Donnelly's \"One Country Project,\" which, its website says, \"is dedicated to reopening the dialogue with rural communities, rebuilding trust and respect, and advancing an opportunity agenda for rural Americans.\" The project has three main purposes: building a data center \"on rural opinion, voter makeup, demographics, turnout, long-term trends, and issue salience\"; creating a network to engage rural voters; and developing policy aimed at rural America. \n",
      " Heitkamp rejected the notion that her party has a \"binary choice\" between appealing to rural voters or to urban, blue-state voters. As she put it, the New York cabdriver has the same concerns people in her state do when it comes to \"dwindling pay checks,\" health care and education. The particular solutions may be different - for example, in education, where long distances necessary to get to schools pose special challenges in rural America. \n",
      " She also talked about loss of grocery stores and \"food deserts\" in rural America. \n",
      " listen live \n",
      " watch live \n",
      " What does she recommend Democrats do to attract rural voters? \"You've got to show up, but you can't show up empty-handed,\" she said. Candidates better show up with policy ideas. \n",
      " I asked her if President Donald Trump's supporters feel betrayed by the broken promises on health care and tariff wars. \"I don't think they feel betrayed. The small manufacturing company has been facing cheap imports from China.\" Meanwhile, \"farmers are incredibly aware of trade [issues],\" she said, but they continue to think Trump will open up new markets and they'll be better off in the long run. Heitkamp said solemnly, \"There no proof that is going to happen.\" The real concern should be that when you lose markets, they're usually gone for good. When overseas demand drops, prices plummet. \"That's going to have ramifications for years to come,\" she said. As for trade assistance, farmers are skeptical that the current level of support will continue. Moreover, they'd rather be in business than \"sitting at home getting a check.\" \n",
      " On health care, Heitkamp identified two issues: access and workforce. Keeping rural facilities in place is critical and has everything to do with reimbursements. Medicaid expansion kept many rural health facilities in business; if that gets rolled back, these will disappear. She said that if you look at a map, the availability of rural health care services is highest where Medicaid expansion took place. When Trump's administration joins a lawsuit to destroy the Affordable Care Act, that will \"reverberate throughout rural America,\" she said. The second problem is attracting a skilled workforce that can provide needed services. She pointed to the lack of mental health professionals. A school with a suicidal child may find there is a two-month wait for that child to see a mental health professional, Heitkamp said. \"Rural health care is in crisis.\" \n",
      " Heitkamp was known in the Senate as intensely practical and ready to work across the aisle on issues that affected her state. Her political strategy is similarly down to earth. \"Democrats don't have to win in rural America, they just have to stop losing by so much,\" she said. \n",
      " Democratic contenders should heed her advice. What they may not be able to duplicate, however, is Heitkamp's obvious love and concern for her rural neighbors. She cares intensely about their well being. And empathy is hard to fake, especially when you rarely show up or come empty-handed. \n",
      " Finally, there is a great deal of talk about the need for diversity on the Democratic ticket. \"Diversity\" should also include geographic and professional diversity. If not at the top of the ticket, candidates from the \"heartland\" such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., should be in the mix. The so-called Republican lock on the electoral college and the Senate won't be a lock if Democrats can break the GOP's iron grip on states such as Iowa. Knowing a thing or two about rural broadband, soy bean prices and rural health care would sure help. \n",

      "78604 — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) May 31, 2019 \n",
      " Warren’s newest proposal came two days after Mueller delivered a statement to the press about his report on Trump’s 2016 campaign and his alleged attempts to obstruct justice during Mueller’s two-year investigation. The special counsel  reiterated  that he was not confident that the president did not commit a crime, but pointed to a Watergate-era statute which prohibited him from bringing charges against Trump. \n",
      " “Mueller’s statement made clear what those of us who have read his report already knew: He’s referring President Trump for impeachment, and it’s up to Congress to act,” wrote Warren. “But impeachment isn’t supposed to be the only way that a president can be held accountable for committing a crime. That’s why I’ve got a plan to make sure that no president is above the law.” \n",
      " Under Warren’s plan, Congress would pass legislation clarifying that the Department of Justice (DOJ) can indict a sitting president. The new law would negate a determination made by the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel in 1973 that a criminal case against the president would be detrimental to the country, leaving Congress only with the option of impeaching a president in the case of criminal wrongdoing. \n",
      " “Yes, Congress has a constitutional obligation to impeach the president when he violates the law,” Warren said. “But lawyers for previous presidents have used this constitutional duty to argue that the only way the president can be held accountable for criminal behavior is through impeachment.” \n",
      " “Congress should make it clear that the president can be held accountable for violating the law, just like everyone else,” she added. \n",
      " Warren also called for amendments to obstruction of justice statutes. The new laws would make it clear that actions including Trump’s  firing  of former FBI Director James Comey and his  alleged offer  to pardon former lawyer Michael Cohen if he lied to Congress on his behalf, would constitute indictable offenses. \n",
      " “Most people agree that these laws apply to the president, but some partisan extremists, like Attorney General Bill Barr, have argued that they don’t,” Warren wrote. \n",
      " Barr, Warren argued, “disgraced himself” when he  disobeyed  a congressional subpoena to release the unredacted Mueller report and  vehemently defended  the president in his summary of Mueller’s findings. If elected president, the senator wrote, she would appoint an attorney general and other agency officials who would reverse the DOJ’s 1973 opinion and “who [know] their job is to objectively advise the executive branch on what it can and cannot do under the Constitution.” \n",
      " “Our democracy only works if everyone can be held accountable,” wrote Warren. “These changes will make sure that’s the case for generations to come.” \n",

      " Flip \n",
      " Oh, the tangled web we weave…! During a conspicuously uncomfortable and hard-hitting interview on the syndicated radio show “ The Breakfast Club ,” presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren was grilled on why she identified as “Native American” on her Texas bar registration card and at Harvard. \n",
      " It’s a question Warren hasn’t had to field in a while and one to which her answer, depending on when it was asked, would have ranged from self-righteous indignation to contrition over having misrepresented herself. At the height of her “identity” problem in October 2018, LU’s Ben Bowles quipped that maybe the solution for Warren was to claim that she “self-identifies” as an American Indian. \n",
      " That is sort of where Breakfast Club host Lenard Larry McKelvey’s head was when he exclaimed to Warren, “You’re kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal a little bit — Rachel Dolezal is the white woman pretending to be black.” \n",
      " The fun begins in the video below starting at about the 21:40 mark. \n",
      " Trending: Child rapist found back in Kansas 14 days after being deported \n",
      " Warren responded this time by feebly explaining that she believed the family stories that were passed down from her parents and extended family. She added that the Boston Globe found that she didn’t benefit from her previous claims in school or when it came to her professional life.“Nothing about my family ever affected any job I ever got,” the senator said. \n",
      " That’s not entirely true. According to The Globe, back in 1984, Warren and members her family contributed recipes to a Native American cookbook, where she signed her name “Elizabeth Warren, Cherokee.” Two years later Warren listed herself as a “minority” in the American Association of Law Schools’ directory of faculty, which is commonly used by recruiters. In the early 1990s, she was hired by Harvard as a law professor, and the university actually touted Warren’s phony ancestry. \n",
      " Before she finally submitted to taking a DNA test that proved that she had less American Indian blood than the average American, Warren’s proof of her native heritage was …well, that she has high cheekbones . \n",
      " I still have a picture on my mantel at home, and it’s a picture my mother had before that, a picture of my grandfather. And my Aunt Bea has walked by that picture at least 1,000 times, remarked that he … had high cheekbones like all of the Indians do, because that’s how she saw it. And she said, ‘And your mother got those same great cheekbones, and I didn’t.’ \n",
      " High cheekbones aside, Warren never had an adequate explanation for her very un-Cherokee-like blond hair and blue eyes. \n",

      " news 15 hours ago Newser — Newser Editors \n",
      " When Robert Mueller spoke publicly this week, he explained that \"long-standing\" policy of the Justice Department prohibits the indictment of a sitting president. On Friday, 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren said it's time to change that policy. \n",
      " In a post at Medium , she unveiled a plan to do just that, one that begins with passing a law that explicitly allows the Justice Department to indict the White House occupant. \n",
      " \"Congress should make it clear that it wants the President to be held accountable for violating the law, just like everyone else,\" writes Warren. She added that she would appoint Justice Department officials willing to \"reverse flawed policies so no President is shielded from criminal accountability.\" As the New York Times notes, Warren already had come out in favor of impeachment of Trump, and she doubled down on that Friday. \n",
      " \"Mueller's statement made clear what those of us who have read his report already knew: He’s referring Donald Trump for impeachment, and it's up to Congress to act,\" she writes. \n",
      " Meanwhile, Fox News notes that Warren appeared on the syndicated Breakfast Club radio show Friday and had to deal with an issue that won't seem to go away. \n",
      " \"You're kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal ,\" host \"Charlamagne tha God\" told her, referring to the controversy regarding Warren's past claims of Native American ancestry . \n",
      " Responded Warren: “I'm not a person of color, I'm not a citizen of a tribe. And I shouldn’t have done it.” (Warren and her fellow 2020 candidates have a long way to go to catch Joe Biden in the polls.) \n",
      " More From Newser\n",
      "86951 Elizabeth Warren continues to focus on policy instead of questions of whether she’s electable \n",
      " Share \n",
      " During an appearance on the daytime talk show The View on May 30, host Meghan McCain asked Elizabeth Warren about how the media covers her, as a woman and one of the 20-plus Democrats running for president. Warren's response to the question didn't mention the various articles that endlessly belabor her electability, likability, and similarities to former Democratic presidential hopeful and other blonde woman Hillary Clinton. Rather, Warren continued to focus on policy and cited her own history as a politician to frame her 2020 run in a crowded field of candidates — and her answer shed light on what we miss out on when media outlets focus on the question of \"electability.\" \n",
      " \"In 2012 I ran against an incumbent Republican who was very popular, and who had beaten a very very capable woman just about three years earlier,\" Warren explained to hosts McCain , Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin, and Abby Huntsman. In 2012, Warren defeated incumbent Republican Senator Scott Brown , in an expensive and heated race for the Senate seat. \n",
      " \"A lot of folks said 'Elizabeth, you shouldn't run, you're going to lose, because Massachusetts is not going to a elect a woman for a seat like that. Not for governor, not for senator.' My answer? I just stayed in there and kept fighting for what I believe in. And inch by inch, person by person – I started down by 17 points. I ended up beating that guy by 7 and a half. \" \n",
      " Warren's response is relatively standard for her presidential campaign – and it's not the first time she's had to answer a question similar to McCain's. During a town hall in April, a woman in the audience asked Warren if she learned any lessons from the sexism in 2016 election . Warren gave a nearly identical answer to the one she gave on The View, discussing her senate race in 2012. \n",
      " \"I kept getting out there talking about what’s happening with working families across the country,\" she told the audience member. \"Talking about how Washington works great for the rich and the powerful, just not working for anyone else, and how we’ve got to fight back against that.\" \n",
      " She has become known for responding to reactionary moments with grounded information and forward-thinking policies . When asked about the press coverage she's received, Warren didn't focus on the media's reaction to her campaign. She responded to McCain's question by giving examples of how she responded to similar treatment in the past, and pivoted back to the issues that she is focused on. \n",
      " She was on the show to promote her most recent policy rollout, universal childcare. It's one of a dozen proposals Warren's made since she announced her candidacy – others include student loan forgiveness, improving maternal health care, and fighting climate change. Her campaign has pushed her \"I have a plan for that,\" approach for the past several weeks, and the strategy appears to be working. \n",
      " The New York Times reported on May 28 that Warren is polling third behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, though considering how far away we are from the primaries, these numbers aren't the most reliable. \n",
      " Her high polling numbers are that way perhaps in spite of the op-eds and analytical media coverage about Warren's electability that plagued the first months of her presidential run. Nationally recognized publications have been guilty of running pieces that compare Warren to Hillary Clinton, and have spent a disproportionate amount of time questioning whether Warren specifically can stand a chance against defeating Donald Trump. And writers, pollsters, and pundits questioned whether Warren's focus on policy would alienate her from voters. \n",
      " This coverage happened concurrently with stories of the multiple allegations of inappropriate touching and sexual harassment made against Biden. This hasn't seemed to affect Biden's polling numbers , and the allegations didn't seem to draw the same questions about electability that Warren's campaign has. \n",
      " It does beg the question: are the factors by which we're determining electability even relevant? Polling data – as often as it is correct – has been catastrophically wrong in crucial moments . Fundraising – as necessary as it is – has become more scrutinized as more politicians reject corporate funds . And likability seems to be a factor that is only applied to political candidates who aren't men – making it not just an unfair metric, but an inaccurate one. \n",
      " As Moira Donegan wrote for the Guardian in January , \"the question of “likability” as it is applied to women candidates has become a kind of cipher through which pundits, strategists and ordinary Americans discuss our collective discomfort with women in power.\" \n",
      " Which is not to say that this coverage that McCain refers to, and that Warren deftly spoke around isn't impactful. By constantly pondering in the public forum if Elizabeth Warren is electable in a way that no other candidate is scrutinized, her entire campaign is thrown to the sidelines of that question. Other women running for president have been criticized for other things, but none have had \"electability\" thrown at them to the same extent as Warren. \n",
      " Treating men, and especially white men as inherently electable has allowed candidates like Beto O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg to approach their actual platforms and beliefs with less urgency. O'Rourke spoke about his first concrete policy proposal – concerning immigration reform – in the last week of May, even though he's been formally running for president since March 14. Buttigieg often uses vague rhetoric when talking about issues like abortion, taxes, and climate change , and while he believes a lot things, he didn't propose any specific solutions until after he was challenged in a town hall about his lack of policy proposals. \n",
      " A lack critical analysis of Warren and her policies is not only unfair to her, but also to voters. There are plenty of things she should regularly be challenged on: her stance on sex work , her linkage of fighting climate change to national security , that time she did a DNA test in response to Trump's taunts about her Native American heritage . \n",
      " Clearly, we're not going to reach a point where gender – or any other identity – is no longer a factor for candidates. Too few people who aren't white men have been elected to public office for that to be the case. But if press coverage of women who run remains reductive, media (and likely, also the country) runs the risk of permanently asking the question: \"Is this woman electable?\" instead of \"Should we elect this woman?\"\n",
      "87289 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren compared to Rachel Dolezal in interview \n",
      " Share: \n",
      " ABCNews \n",
      " By CHEYENNE HASLETT \n",
      " In an interview on \"The Breakfast Club\" Friday morning, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked a host of questions about her Native American ancestry claims and compared to Rachel Dolezal, the former NAACP leader who was outed as a white woman pretending to be black in 2015. \n",
      " \"I grew up in Oklahoma, I learned about my family, the same way most people learn about their family, from my momma and my daddy and my aunts and my uncles, and it's what I believed,\" Warren said about her previous claims to be of Native American heritage. \n",
      " \"But I'm not a person of color. I'm not a citizen of a tribe. And I shouldn't have done it,\" she said. \n",
      " Charlamagne Tha God, a co-host of the morning radio program that has become an increasingly popular platform for candidates looking to reach young, minority voters, asked Warren if she would choose not to take a DNA test to prove her heritage, which she did in October and which was largely criticized by tribes who said DNA was a separate discussion from tribal identity and citizenship. \n",
      " Warren revealed the DNA test after constant attacks from the president, who frequently calls Warren \"Pocahontas,\"  a nickname that some critics say amounts to a racial slur. \n",
      " Pocahontas was a historical figure often revered for her role as a Colonial-era emissary. \n",
      " Warren said she couldn't \"go back now,\" but that she can \"try to be a good partner\" moving forward. \"I'm not a person of color. I'm not a citizen of a tribe. And tribal citizenship is an important distinction. And not something I am,\" Warren said. \n",
      " Chalamagne then compared Warren to Dolezal who grew up identifying as white but, as an adult, changed her name and chose to identify as a black woman. Using that false racial identity, she rose through the ranks at her local NAACP chapter, taught African American studies at the collegiate level and once claimed to be the victim of a racially motivated hate crime. Her parents eventually told the media that she really was white. \n",
      " \"You're kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal, a little bit. Rachel Dolezal was a white woman pretending to be black,\" he said to Warren. \n",
      " \"Well, this is just what I learned from my family,\" she responded of her family's anecdotal claims of Native American ancestry. \n",
      " Warren's campaign did not respond to an ABC News request for comment. \n",
      " The host also asked her if she'd benefited from stating Native American as her heritage, such as writing \"American Indian\" on a State Bar of Texas registration card in 1986, which the Washington Post reported in February. DJ Envy, another co-host, asked if she had received a discount to go to college, referencing the government's program for Native American education grants. \n",
      " \"Nope. Boston Globe did a full investigation. It never affected - nothing about my family ever affected any job I ever got,\" Warren said. \n",
      " Warren was also asked about her past as a Republican, which she was registered as until the late 1990s. \n",
      " \"So what made you register as a Republican back then? Because that's the Reagan years, that's the War on Drugs,\" Charlamagne asked her. \n",
      " Warren, who has been a pacesetter for policy ideas in the 2020 cycle, said she wasn't \"politically active\" during those years and eventually broke into politics to get into \"the policy end of it.\" \n",
      " Charlamagne said that Warren had \"a lot of confusion back in the day\" between her Native American heritage and switching political allegiances. \n",
      " \"You know, a big part of it was when I got into the fights over - you gotta make the law reflect our values, you gotta have a law that doesn't just work for those at the top and that works for everyone else,\" Warren said, circling back to different policies she's proposed ahead of the 2020 election . \n",
      " In large part, the majority of the nearly hour-long interview was spent discussing Warren's plans for historically black colleges and universities, which she wants to give $50 billion in grants to, and addressing redlining that held black homeowners back until the 1960s with new affordable housing units. \n",
      " Warren also talked about her support for reparations, though she said she had yet to hear a conclusive decision from experts on the best way for the reparations to be paid to the descendants of those who were enslaved in the U.S. \n",
      " But hours later, it was Dolezal who was trending on Twitter. \n",
      " America Rising, a Republican opposition research PAC, posted the video on their YouTube and was using it to fundraise on Twitter. \n",
      " Warren isn't the first politician to land in hot water on the show. Earlier this year Sen. Kamala Harris drew criticism when she was asked directly if she ever smoked marijuana. Harris confirmed she smoked, and was asked what music she listened to at the time. \n",
      " Harris said she listened to rappers Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur while she was in college. Both rappers however were not producing music by the time she graduated in 1986. \n",
      " Former Sen. Hillary Clinton was asked on the show what item she always carries with her, her response was hot sauce. \n",

      " On Friday, Warren appeared on The Breakfast Club radio show, where she was interviewed by radio personality Charlamagne Tha God (real name: Lenard Larry McKelvey). She was asked by the host to explain why she once claimed to have had Native American ancestry, even though that claim is widely regarded as suspicious. \n",
      " As previously reported by The Inquisitr , a scandal of sorts erupted around Warren in 2012, when the Boston Herald revealed that Warren had claimed to have Native American ancestry on her employment paperwork for both the University of Pennsylvania and then Harvard. Whether or not her claims of Native American ancestry helped her in her career remain uncertain. \n",
      " What is certain, however, is that those claims have garnered her unwanted attention. Donald Trump, for example, has repeatedly called her “Pocahontas.” Making matters worse, Warren later took a commercial ancestry DNA test that revealed that she did have a Native American ancestor, but it was likely six to ten generations ago. \n",
      " Warren, for her part, tried to explain herself to Charlamagne Tha God. “I grew up in Oklahoma. I learned about my family the same way most people learn about their family, from my momma and my daddy and my aunts and my uncles, and it’s what I believed. But I’m not a person of color. I’m not a citizen of a tribe, and I shouldn’t have done it,” she said. \n",

She was “outed” by her parents in 2015 as being white and having no African ancestry; further, police found no evidence that she had been victimized criminally. To this day, she continues to claim that she “identifies” as black. \n",

      " In a surprise move, Nevada Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak on Thursday vetoed national popular vote legislation backed by his own party. \n",
      " The veto is the governor’s first since entering office this year. It also stands in contrast to the growing number of Democratic-controlled states that have recently passed similar legislation. \n",
      " Assembly Bill 186 would have added Nevada to the the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which requires the state’s six electoral college votes go to the presidential candidate who wins the national popular vote. \n",
      " The compact means Nevada’s electoral votes could potentially go to a presidential candidate that a majority of Nevada voters didn’t support, a point Sisolak made in a statement on his veto. \n",
      " “Over the past several weeks, my office has heard from thousands of Nevadans across the state urging me to weigh the state’s role in our national elections. After thoughtful deliberation, I have decided to veto Assembly Bill 186,” Sisolak  tweeted  on Thursday morning. “Once effective, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact could diminish the role of smaller states like Nevada in national electoral contests and force Nevada’s electors to side with whoever wins the nationwide popular vote, rather than the candidate Nevadans choose.” \n",
      " Sisolak also said he doesn’t believe joining the compact is in the state’s best interest. \n",
      " “I recognize that many of my fellow Nevadans may disagree on this point and I appreciate the legislature’s thoughtful consideration of this important issue,” he added. “As Nevada’s governor, I am obligated to make such decisions according to my own conscience. In cases like this, where Nevada’s interests could diverge from the interests of large states, I will always stand up for Nevada. \n",
      " The legislation found no support among Nevada’s Republican caucus. \n",
      " Nevada would have been the 15th state to join the compact, which only takes effect when enough states join to secure 270 out of 538 of electoral votes nationwide. \n",
      " Colorado recently passed a law joining the compact. The new Colorado law is being challenged by a group who hopes to put the question on the ballot. \n",
      " New Mexico  and Delaware  also joined the compact this year. \n",
      " “Since January, the National Popular Vote bill has been enacted in three states, passed 11 legislative chambers and continues to be under consideration in Oregon. We will continue our bipartisan work in every state until the National Popular Vote proposal takes effect and every American voter is politically relevant in every presidential election,” said Patrick Rosenstiel, a senior consultant to National Popular Vote, Inc. \n",

      " Erick Erickson Blocked on Twitter for 'Hate Speech' Over Liz Warren Joke \n",
      " On Twitter, no one is safe. Two weeks back, Twitter suspended the Heritage Foundation's director of media, Greg Scott. On Friday, the social media company suspended radio host, Resurgent founder, and former RedState editor-in-chief Erick Erickson — for a joke tweet about 2020 Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \n",
      " \"Elizabeth Warren set to introduce the Wrecking American Prosperity Under Marxism, or WAMPUM Act, wherein she gives everything away for free,\" Erickson tweeted, in a clear dig at Warren's support for big government programs aimed at alleviating poverty that would undermine America's free market. \n",
      " Twitter didn't get the joke. The social media platform blocked Erickson for allegedly \"violating our rules against hateful conduct.\" The company added, \"you may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.\" \n",
      " — Greg Scott (@GScottSays) May 31, 2019 \n",
      " Such restatements of Twitter's policy do not explain how the alleged offender actually \"violated\" the policy. Instead, companies like Twitter are expressly vague so that they can apply their policies as broadly and selectively as possible. \n",
      " In a response to PJ Media, Erick Erickson acknowledged that Twitter is a private company, but he did call out the company for its apparent bias against conservatives. \n",
      " \"I think Twitter is a private company and can do what it wants, but I think Twitter also clearly is more predisposed to punish conservatives than progressives,\" Erickson said. \" It’s somewhat ironic that they did this today about the time Elizabeth Warren was, again, having to revisit that controversy.\" \n",
      " Indeed, earlier on Friday, Warren appeared on the radio show The Breakfast Club, and co-host Charlamagne tha God pressed her on her DNA test fiasco . \n",
      " \"You're kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal, a little bit. Rachel Dolezal was a white woman pretending to be black,\" the co-host said. This was an incredibly clever quip, as Dolezal is a white woman who identified herself as black, and Warren is a white woman who identified herself as Native American, and arguably got ahead in her career through this posing. \n",
      " As the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign was getting started, Warren took a DNA test and published the results — 0.18 percent Native American. The Cherokee Nation attacked Warren, saying \"a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship.\" \n",
      " Warren's attempt to pose as Native America is an eminently mockable fact, and Erick Erickson was not \"harassing\" her with his joke tweet. Sadly, while Twitter blocks Greg Scott and Erick Erickson, the company still has not responded to PJ Media's inquiries as to whether Pennsylvania State Rep. Brian Sims violated Twitter's rules by harassing pro-life women or whether actor Jim Carrey violated Twitter's rules when he depicted Gov. Kay Ivey (R-Ala.) getting killed in an abortion . \n",

      " Jennifer Rubin, The Washington Post \n",
      " Published \n",
      " 6:21 am PDT, Friday, May 31, 2019 \n",
      " Former senators Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., lost their reelection races last year. Looking over the post-election data, Heitkamp told me in a phone interview that there was \"a steady but persistent erosion\" of support for Democratic candidates in the great swath of red America. \"When you look at the numbers, it's hard to win the Senate or potentially the president without getting votes in rural America.\" \n",
      " She stressed that Democrats need to expand their appeal. \"It will be easier to govern,\" she said. Heitkamp warned that no party should have a lock in one geographic area; the result would be polarization and the party with monopoly strength taking voters for granted. \n",
      " That was the genesis for Heitkamp and Donnelly's \"One Country Project,\" which, its website says, \"is dedicated to reopening the dialogue with rural communities, rebuilding trust and respect, and advancing an opportunity agenda for rural Americans.\" The project has three main purposes: building a data center \"on rural opinion, voter makeup, demographics, turnout, long-term trends, and issue salience\"; creating a network to engage rural voters; and developing policy aimed at rural America. \n",
      " Heitkamp rejected the notion that her party has a \"binary choice\" between appealing to rural voters or to urban, blue-state voters. As she put it, the New York cabdriver has the same concerns people in her state do when it comes to \"dwindling pay checks,\" health care and education. The particular solutions may be different - for example, in education, where long distances necessary to get to schools pose special challenges in rural America. \n",
      " She also talked about loss of grocery stores and \"food deserts\" in rural America. \n",
      " What does she recommend Democrats do to attract rural voters? \"You've got to show up, but you can't show up empty-handed,\" she said. Candidates better show up with policy ideas. \n",
      " I asked her if President Donald Trump's supporters feel betrayed by the broken promises on health care and tariff wars. \"I don't think they feel betrayed. The small manufacturing company has been facing cheap imports from China.\" Meanwhile, \"farmers are incredibly aware of trade [issues],\" she said, but they continue to think Trump will open up new markets and they'll be better off in the long run. Heitkamp said solemnly, \"There no proof that is going to happen.\" The real concern should be that when you lose markets, they're usually gone for good. When overseas demand drops, prices plummet. \"That's going to have ramifications for years to come,\" she said. As for trade assistance, farmers are skeptical that the current level of support will continue. Moreover, they'd rather be in business than \"sitting at home getting a check.\" \n",
      " On health care, Heitkamp identified two issues: access and workforce. Keeping rural facilities in place is critical and has everything to do with reimbursements. Medicaid expansion kept many rural health facilities in business; if that gets rolled back, these will disappear. She said that if you look at a map, the availability of rural health care services is highest where Medicaid expansion took place. When Trump's administration joins a lawsuit to destroy the Affordable Care Act, that will \"reverberate throughout rural America,\" she said. The second problem is attracting a skilled workforce that can provide needed services. She pointed to the lack of mental health professionals. A school with a suicidal child may find there is a two-month wait for that child to see a mental health professional, Heitkamp said. \"Rural health care is in crisis.\" \n",
      " Heitkamp was known in the Senate as intensely practical and ready to work across the aisle on issues that affected her state. Her political strategy is similarly down to earth. \"Democrats don't have to win in rural America, they just have to stop losing by so much,\" she said. \n",
      " Democratic contenders should heed her advice. What they may not be able to duplicate, however, is Heitkamp's obvious love and concern for her rural neighbors. She cares intensely about their well being. And empathy is hard to fake, especially when you rarely show up or come empty-handed. \n",
      " Finally, there is a great deal of talk about the need for diversity on the Democratic ticket. \"Diversity\" should also include geographic and professional diversity. If not at the top of the ticket, candidates from the \"heartland\" such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., should be in the mix. The so-called Republican lock on the electoral college and the Senate won't be a lock if Democrats can break the GOP's iron grip on states such as Iowa. Knowing a thing or two about rural broadband, soy bean prices and rural health care would sure help.\n",

Elizabeth Warren speaks to local residents during a meet and greet, Sunday, May 26, 2019, in Ottumwa, Iowa.   (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) \n",
      " (Newser) –                                          When Robert Mueller spoke publicly this week, he explained that \"long-standing\" policy of the Justice Department prohibits the indictment of a sitting president. On Friday, 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren said it's time to change that policy. In a post at Medium , she unveiled a plan to do just that, one that begins with passing a law that explicitly allows the Justice Department to indict the White House occupant. \"Congress should make it clear that it wants the President to be held accountable for violating the law, just like everyone else,\" writes Warren. She added that she would appoint Justice Department officials willing to \"reverse flawed policies so no President is shielded from criminal accountability.\" As the New York Times notes, Warren already had come out in favor of impeachment of Trump, and she doubled down on that Friday. \n",
      " \"Mueller's statement made clear what those of us who have read his report already knew: He’s referring Donald Trump for impeachment, and it's up to Congress to act,\" she writes. Meanwhile, Fox News notes that Warren appeared on the syndicated Breakfast Club radio show Friday and had to deal with an issue that won't seem to go away. \"You're kind of like the original Rachel Dolezal ,\" host \"Charlamagne tha God\" told her, referring to the controversy regarding Warren's past claims of Native American ancestry . Responded Warren: “I'm not a person of color, I'm not a citizen of a tribe. And I shouldn’t have done it.” (Warren and her fellow 2020 candidates have a long way to go to catch Joe Biden in the polls.)\n",
      "97701 Digital gap between rural and nonrural America persists \n",
      " By Andrew Perrin \n",
      " This is one in a series of posts about how different demographic groups in the U.S. have fared in the digital age. \n",
      " Rural Americans have made large gains in adopting digital technology over the past decade, but they generally remain less likely than urban or suburban adults to have home broadband or own a smartphone. \n",
      " Roughly two-thirds of rural Americans (63%) say they have a broadband internet connection at home, up from about a third (35%) in 2007, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in early 2019. Rural Americans are now 12 percentage points less likely than Americans overall to have home broadband; in 2007, there was a 16-point gap between rural Americans (35%) and all U.S. adults (51%) on this question. \n",
      " As is true for the nation as a whole, mobile technology use among rural adults has also risen rapidly, with the share of those owning smartphones and tablets increasing sharply since 2011. Ownership of desktop or laptop computers, by contrast, has only slightly risen since 2008. \n",
      " The gap between rural and urban adults has narrowed for some devices like traditional and tablet computers, but rural adults still remain less likely than suburban adults to own these technologies. \n",
      " Rural adults are also less likely than suburban adults to have multiple devices or services that enable them to go online: About three-in-ten adults who live in rural communities (31%) report that they own a desktop or laptop computer, a smartphone, a home broadband connection and a tablet computer. By contrast, 43% of suburban adults own all four of these technologies. \n",
      " Rural residents go online less frequently than their urban and suburban counterparts. Roughly three-quarters (76%) of adults who live in rural communities say they use the internet on at least a daily basis, compared with more than eight-in-ten of those in suburban (86%) or urban (83%) areas. Meanwhile, 15% of rural adults say they never go online, compared with less than one-in-ten of those who live in urban communities (9%) and those who live in the suburbs (6%). \n",
      " In a separate survey the Center conducted in 2018, adults who live in rural areas were more likely to say that getting access to high-speed internet is a major problem in their local community: 24% say this, compared with 13% of urban adults and 9% of rural adults. In contrast, a majority of adults say that high-speed internet is not a major problem in their local community. Similar rates of concern about access to high-speed internet are shared by rural adults in both lower- and higher-income households, as well as by those with various levels of educational attainment. \n",
      " These comparably low levels of adoption among rural residents may be due to a unique feature of rural life. Even though rural areas are more wired today than in the past, other research shows that substantial segments of rural America still lack the infrastructure needed for high-speed internet, and what access these areas do have tends to be slower than that of nonrural areas. The Federal Communications Commission is on Phase II of its Connect America Fund , a plan to expand broadband access and mobile coverage for rural communities in the U.S. \n",
      " Despite lower levels of technology ownership and use, only 36% of rural adults say the government should provide subsidies to help low-income Americans purchase high-speed home internet service, compared with 50% of urban residents and 43% of suburbanites, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey . \n",

      " MINDEN, Nev. (AP) — In California, Elizabeth Warren gazed into a laptop camera, resting her chin on her hand while recounting her working-class childhood for about 200 voters scattered hundreds of miles away across Nevada. \n",
      " In Minden, Nevada, about 40 Democrats watched on a small television as Warren delivered parts of her stump speech before fielding her first question, posed by a teacher dialing into the videoconference from a high school library seven hours away in West Wendover. \n",
      " Warren was one of four Democratic presidential candidates pioneering a virtual campaign trail Friday night in rural Nevada. The early voting state has struggled to attract presidential candidates to its far-flung and sparsely populated towns, spurring Nevada Democrats to set up videoconference town halls with candidates. \n",
      " \"This is a way for us to get to see them and let them see us and see that we are here,\" said Janet Walls, a 77-year-old Democrat from Minden. \"Don't forget us.\" \n",
      " Along with Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, author and spiritual leader Marianne Williamson and Massachusetts congressman Seth Moulton all participated in the cyber-campaigning Friday, speaking one after another to at least 17 locations around the state. \n",
      " Nevada, the third-in-line state to cast votes on the Democratic presidential nominee, isn't as compact or accessible as New Hampshire, Iowa or South Carolina, where candidates can more quickly and easily visit rural areas. \n",
      " Walls acknowledged the challenges that keep most Democratic presidential candidates from journeying to rural Nevada, where they might be met with a sparse crowd. \n",
      " \"I don't like it, but I understand it,\" she said. \n",
      " Kimi Cole, the chair of the Rural Nevada Democratic Caucus, organized the virtual visits to ensure voters in remote parts of the state can play a role in vetting the party's crowded field of White House hopefuls. \n",
      " It could be a nationwide model as presidential candidates expand the traditional campaign map to seek support in places where Democrats have struggled, including rural America. For the candidates struggling to break out of a crowded Democratic field, rural support could make a vital difference in Nevada's caucuses. \n",
      " Cole said about 200 people tuned in to the cyber-visits from libraries, schools, homes and even a pizza parlor. \n",
      " There were some technical complications, including a few instances where candidates' microphones were accidently muted or their words were drowned out by their own voice echoing across the other screen. But on the whole, voters who participated seemed enthusiastic about the opportunity and asked questions about issues like tribal sovereignty, natural resources and the opioid epidemic. \n",
      " Loretta Kuliawat, 56, compared Booker's cyber appearance to a campaign stop he made in her town last month — the only candidate to visit Minden in person. \n",
      " \"I don't feel any difference between watching him today and being in the room with him,\" she said. She called the virtual visits \"a really nice stopgap\" until the candidates show up in person. \n",
      " Before each candidate signed off, Cole pressed that point with them. \n",
      " \"That doesn't let you off the hook from coming out in person,\" Cole said to Warren. \n",

      " Lawrence Agcaoili (The Philippine Star) - June 2, 2019 - 12:00am \n",
      " MANILA, Philippines — The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has closed down another problematic bank, bringing to four the number of financial institutions shuttered last month and seven so far this year. \n",
      " The central bank’s Monetary Board issued MB Resolution 802 last Thursday prohibiting East Coast Rural Bank of Hagonoy Inc. from doing business in the Philippines and placing it under the supervision of the state-run Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. \n",
      " East Coast Rural Bank of Hagonoy is a single-unit rural bank located at HRBI Compound, G. Panganiban St., Brgy. Santo Niño Hagonoy, Bulacan. \n",
      " Latest available records showed EastCoast Rural Bank of Hagonoy has 1,412 deposit accounts with total deposit liabilities of P122 million as of the end of March, of which 91.36 percent or P111.4million are insured deposits. \n",
      " PDIC assured depositors that all valid deposits and claims shall be paid up to the maximum deposit insurance coverage of P500,000. Individual account holders of valid deposits with balances of P100,000 and below do not need to file deposit insurance claims, provided they have no outstanding obligations or have not acted as co-makers of obligations. \n",
      " Other banks closed down in May include the Rural Bank of Guihulungan (Negros Oriental), Rural Bank of Basey (Samar) and Iloilo-based Valiant Bank Inc. \n",
      " Banks also ordered closed by the central bank this year include Puerto Princesa-based Palawan Bank, Rural Bank of Mabitac (Laguna) and Bagong Bangko Rural ng Malabang (Lanao del Sur). \n",
      " Last year, BSP closed down 12 problematic banks. \n",
      " The government continues to provide incentives under the Consolidation Program for Rural Banks to encourage mergers and consolidations among small banks, particularly rural banks, to further strengthen and enhance the viability of the banking system.\n",
