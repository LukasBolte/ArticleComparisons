      " Baltimore Orioles' Dwight Smith Jr. celebrates his grand slam during the first inning of a baseball game against the San Francisco Giants, Friday, May 31, 2019, in Baltimore. Nick Wass / AP \n",
      " Share Adjust Comment Print \n",
      " BALTIMORE — Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the centre field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.’s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " “I feel like every time he is around I do something,” the younger Smith said. “He’s a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.” \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " “It’s been a rough couple of months,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “We’ve had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.” \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " “A great day by the kid,” Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. “He’s done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.” \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith’s grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz’s ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn’t allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " “It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,” Cashner said. “I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.” \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles’ bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year’s Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. “Nothing’s really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,” Elias said. … The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",
      " TRAINER’S ROOM \n",
      " Orioles: OF Mark Trumbo (knee surgery) had his third rehab assignment for Double-A Bowie. He went 2 for 4 with a strikeout and run. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Giants: Shaun Anderson (0-1, 4.80 ERA) will make his fourth major-league start. He allowed six runs (four earned) and nine hits over five innings in his last outing May 26 against Arizona. \n",
      " Orioles: David Hess (1-6, 6.71 ERA) has not won since carrying a no-hitter into the seventh inning April 1 against Toronto. He has given up a league-leading 18 homers over 11 appearances. \n",

      " Defending champ Beavers upset; No. 3s open 12-3 in regionals \n",
      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids - Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",
      " - Oregon State's Adley Rutschman, batting .420 and the likely No. 1 pick in next week's Major League Baseball draft, was intentionally walked with the bases loaded to pull the Beavers within 5-3 in the seventh inning. \n",
      " - Dallas Baptist knocked out Florida starter Tommy Mace after 1 1/3 innings and collected 17 hits against four pitchers in an 11-8 win. \n",
      " - Aaron Schunk hit two of Georgia's three home runs and had five RBIs in a 13-3 win over Mercer. \n",
      " - Florida State's Mike Salvatore had four of his team's 20 hits and Drew Mendoza joined Becker in homering twice against FAU. \n",
      " - Auburn 8-hole hitter Steven Williams had four hits, including a three-run homer, and five RBIs against Coastal Carolina. \n",
      " - Tristin English went 4 for 4 with five RBIs to lead Georgia Tech past Florida A&M 13-2. \n",
      " MOUND MARVELS \n",
      " - Vanderbilt's Drake Fellows earned his nation-leading 12th win, scattering seven hits and striking out nine in an 8-2 win over Ohio State. \n",

      " LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Matt Lloyd hit a three-run homer in the sixth inning, Cole Barr and Drew Ashley each added solo homers and Indiana avoided elimination from the NCAA Louisville Regional with a 9-5 victory over Illinois-Chicago on Saturday. \n",
      " A day after striking out 18 times in an 8-7 loss to Illinois State, the second-seeded Hoosiers (37-22) rebounded with four of their eight hits for extra bases. Lloyd's blast to right field made it 7-3 before Cole Barr and Drew Ashley each homered over the next two innings. \n",
      " Gabe Bierman (4-0) allowed just two hits and two walks and struck out two over 3 2/3 innings of relief for the victory. Tommy Sommer gave up one hit over the final 1 2/3 innings for his first save as Indiana ended a three-game postseason losing streak. The Hoosiers will face the Louisville-Illinois State loser on Sunday. \n",
      " Scott Ota's two-run homer in the bottom of the first gave No. 3 UIC (29-23) its only lead, though the Flames tied it at 3 on Joshua Figueroa's RBI double in the third. \n",

      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4.

Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",

He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",

      " Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter, and put four players on the right side of the infield.

      " Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles, achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a dental procedure) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. \n",

      " AP Sports Writer \n",
      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids - Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",
      " - Oregon State's Adley Rutschman, batting .420 and the likely No. 1 pick in next week's Major League Baseball draft, was intentionally walked with the bases loaded to pull the Beavers within 5-3 in the seventh inning. \n",
      " - Dallas Baptist knocked out Florida starter Tommy Mace after 1 1/3 innings and collected 17 hits against four pitchers in an 11-8 win. \n",
      " - Aaron Schunk hit two of Georgia's three home runs and had five RBIs in a 13-3 win over Mercer. \n",
      " - Florida State's Mike Salvatore had four of his team's 20 hits and Drew Mendoza joined Becker in homering twice against FAU. \n",
      " - Auburn 8-hole hitter Steven Williams had four hits, including a three-run homer, and five RBIs against Coastal Carolina. \n",
      " - Tristin English went 4 for 4 with five RBIs to lead Georgia Tech past Florida A&M 13-2. \n",
      " MOUND MARVELS \n",
      " - Vanderbilt's Drake Fellows earned his nation-leading 12th win, scattering seven hits and striking out nine in an 8-2 win over Ohio State. \n",

      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",

      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",

      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August.

He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",

      " NEW YORK (AP)  Gary Sanchez hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer in the fifth inning, Aroldis Chapman escaped trouble in the ninth and the New York Yankees bullpen held tight again to beat the Boston Red Sox 5-3 Saturday night. \n",
      " After starter Domingo German was chased early, six Yankee relievers combined for 5 1/3 scoreless innings to lock down another victory over the rival Red Sox - New York is 4-0 to start the season series, a first since 2012. \n",
      " Chapman walked Mookie Betts and allowed a single to Andrew Benintendi leading off the ninth, but J.D. Martinez hit a double-play grounder and Rafael Devers rolled the last out to first. \n",
      " Chapman got his 17th save in 18 tries, closing out a game where Chad Green (1-2) and Adam Ottavino stranded runners with timely strikeouts. The bullpen also pitched four shutout innings in a 4-1 win Friday. \n",
      " Boston went 2 for 14 with runners in scoring position, including seven strikeouts. The Red Sox tied a season high with 14 strikeouts and matched a season most with their fourth straight loss. \n",
      " The Yankees have won 15 of 18 and clinched their ninth straight series victory, a first for the franchise since 1998. \n",
      " Xander Bogaerts homered and had three hits for the Red Sox, who have lost 6 of 8 and fell 9 1/2 games behind New York for the AL East lead. That is Boston's biggest deficit in the division since finishing 15 games out in 2015. \n",
      " Sanchez threw his hands at Rick Porcello's 2-2 slider well outside the strike zone and poked it an estimated 403 feet to right-center. It was Sanchez's 18th homer, matching his total from an injury-spoiled 2018. \n",
      " Sanchez was in a five-way tie for the AL home run lead before connecting. \n",
      " DJ LeMahieu's two-run single put New York ahead 3-1 in the second, but Boston tied it in the fourth on Bogaerts' leadoff homer and Sandy Leon's second RBI single of the game. \n",
      " Leon was 3 for 3 before manager Alex Cora replaced him with pinch-hitter Christian Vazquez with a runner on in the eighth. Vazquez hit into an inning-ending double play. \n",
      " Porcello (4-5) faced New York for the first time since his series-clinching victory at Yankee Stadium in Game 4 of last year's AL Division Series. The right-hander entered with a hot hand, but left after allowing five runs in 4 2/3 innings. \n",
      " German allowed three runs in 3 2/3 innings, failing to qualify for what would have been his major league-leading 10th win. He struck out eight but gave up six hits and two walks. \n",
      " Yankees DH Kendrys Morales ended a 1-for-19 skid with three hits. Luke Voit also had three hits. \n",
      " BACK ON TOP \n",
      " Prior to the game, Cora informed Betts that he would be hitting leadoff for the rest of the season. Betts batted first throughout his MVP 2018 season, but Cora opened this year experimenting with Benintendi in the top spot with Betts at No. 2. \n",
      " Batting 1-2 atop the order, Betts and Benintendi combined to go 2 for 9 with three strikeouts and a walk. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Red Sox: Boston placed World Series MVP Steve Pearce on the 10-day IL with a low back strain. 1B/OF Sam Travis was recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket. ... RHP Nathan Eovaldi is set for a second simulated game Tuesday as he works back after having a loose body removed from his right elbow April 23. He threw 22 pitches in a sim game Friday. \n",
      " Yankees: OF Clint Frazier spoke with a trainer after being hit by a pitch in his left elbow in the fifth inning. He stayed in to run but was replaced in right field by Cameron Maybin in the sixth. ... Manager Aaron Boone said SS Didi Gregorius could join New York for its series at Cleveland from June 7-9.

      " 8:34 pm EDT, Saturday, June 1, 2019 \n",
      " LOS ANGELES (AP) — Baylor's Shea Langeliers set an NCAA Baseball Tournament record with 11 runs batted in as the Bears defeated Omaha 24-6 on Saturday and eliminated the Mavericks from the Los Angeles Regional. \n",
      " The previous record was 10 RBIs, which was shared by Vanderbilt's Connor Kaiser (2018) and Miami's Kevin Brown (2001). The junior catcher went 5 for 6, including three home runs. More than half of his RBIs came in the sixth and seventh inning with a three-run double and three-run homer. \n",
      " Baylor scored a run in every inning but the eighth and had 23 hits, 13 of which went for extra bases. Josh Bissonette added four hits while Andy Thomas, Richard Cunningham and Nick Loftin had three apiece as 10 Baylor players got at least one hit. \n",
      " Paul Dickens went 6 2/3 innings for Baylor and allowed six runs on seven hits with five strikeouts. Joey Machado started for Omaha and was one of six pitchers used. The sophomore surrendered three runs on three hits in 1 2/3 innings. \n",
      " Breyden Eckhout had three hits and Parker Smejkal drove in three runs for the Mavericks, who conclude their season 31-24-1. \n",
      " The Bears (35-18) will face the loser of the UCLA-Loyola Marymount game on Sunday. \n",

      " PITTSBURGH — Milwaukee Brewers starter Jhoulys Chacin’s command failed him in the third inning Friday night. And it proved costly. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the inning, three of them with the bases loaded during a 9-4 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. \n",
      " Chacin’s woes included a five-pitch walk to Pirates starter Chris Archer that pushed Pittsburgh’s lead to 5-1. Freddy Peralta replaced Chacin and Kevin Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh’s advantage to 7-1 and drop Chacin (3-7) to 1-7 in his past 10 starts. \n",
      " Chacin — a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series — saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2⅔ innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " “I just lost my focus in that inning,” Chacin said. “That never happened to me before, walking guys with the bases loaded like that. I need to start to do a better job if I want to keep pitching.” \n",
      " Something that might not be guaranteed. Asked if Chacin might need a break, Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said only: “We’ve got to figure out how to get him pitching the way he’s capable of.” \n",
      " Slugger Josh Bell had two of Pittsburgh’s 13 hits — all singles. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. His 94 total bases during the month are the most by any Pirate in any month ever. Heady territory considering Pittsburgh started playing baseball a century — and then some — before Bell was born. \n",
      " “I feel like I’m just riding the wave,” Bell said. \n",
      " One that doesn’t appear close to cresting. \n",
      " Bell’s total base mark broke Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner’s record of 92 set in June, 1947. Bell is also one of only three players in NL history to have 12 home runs and 12 doubles in the same month, joining Hall of Famers Frank Robinson and Hank Aaron. \n",
      " × \n",
      " {{featured_button_text}} \n",
      " “He pushes himself,” Archer (2-5) said of Bell after picking up his first victory since April 7. “If he gets out, he’s mad. He’s hitting .340 and he’s angry that he’s got out, which continues to keep him motivated. He’s not content. We’ve got four months left in the season and I expect to see big things from him going forward.” \n",
      " Bell didn’t provide any big blasts Friday night, but contributed to a flood of small ones as the Pirates won for just the fourth time in 11 games. Starling Marte had three hits and scored three times and Newman went 2-for-5 with two RBIs to extend his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games. \n",
      " Archer had seven strikeouts with two walks in seven innings. He gave up a solo home run to Jesus Aguilar in the third and a three-run shot to Keston Hiura in the fourth but settled down afterward. \n",
      " “I’m going to stay relentless,” Archer said. “I’ve been doing this a long time. I’m not going to let (a slump) define me.” \n",
      " From the infirmary \n",
      " Brewers catcher Manny Pina (right hamstring discomfort) is expected to rejoin Milwaukee over the weekend. Pina was hitting .300 (3-for-10) during a rehab stint with Class A Wisconsin entering Friday. \n",

      " Brewers righty Brandon Woodruff (7-1, 3.22 ERA) will look for his seventh straight win on Saturday. Woodruff entered the season with five career victories spread across 2017 and 2018. He limited the Phillies to one run in eight innings on Sunday. \n",
      " The Pirates’ Nick Kingham (1-1, 8.28) hasn’t won a game as a starter since last July. Kingham — who has bounced between the bullpen and the rotation this season — allowed three runs in 4⅔ innings against Cincinnati on Monday. \n",

      " The Orioles' bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",

      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year's Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J.

      " CINCINNATI — Few teams handle Patrick Corbin’s slider with such aplomb. From the outset, Curt Casali and the Cincinnati Reds knew what they were doing. \n",
      " Casali hit a three-run homer off Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and Cincinnati beat Washington 9-3 Friday night to end the Nationals’ streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " The Reds made quick work of one of the majors’ best pitchers. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2-3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. \n",
      " “It happened so quick,” said Corbin, who trailed 5-0 after only 21 pitches. \n",
      " Corbin was coming off one of his best performances, a four-hitter for his second career shutout against the Marlins on Saturday. His feared slider was a little off from the outset, and the Reds piled up six singles and Casali’s homer in a 30-pitch first inning. \n",
      " “That was a great first inning,” Reds manager David Bell said. “It was really a good offensive night for the entire team.” \n",
      " Casali’s homer was his first this season off a regular pitcher. He also connected off Cubs catcher Victor Caratini during a 10-2 win at Wrigley Field on May 26. Casali added a single and an RBI double as the Reds piled up 15 hits. \n",
      " “I’ve been waiting for a swing like that for a long time,” Casali said. “Getting that big early spot was nice.” \n",
      " Corbin hadn’t allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It’s only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",
      " “He threw some sliders they weren’t chasing,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. “Their approach was really good. They didn’t try to do too much.” \n",
      " Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto’s 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. \n",
      " Cincinnati’s Joey Votto returned after missing three games with a tight right hamstring and had three hits . Eugenio Suarez was back in the lineup after getting hit on the left hand by Clay Holmes’ pitch on Wednesday. \n",
      " DOMINATION \n",
      " The Nationals are 16-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " WORST OF TIMES \n",
      " Corbin gave up a career-high nine runs during a 9-5 loss at Philadelphia on Aug. 25, 2013. \n",
      " RARE, YOUNG COMPANY \n",
      " Soto’s 14-game hitting streak is the longest by a player younger than 21 since Manny Machado also put together a 14-game hitting streak in 2013. Soto turns 21 in October. He had a single, double and homer on Friday. \n",
      " MAY POWER \n",
      " The Reds hit 45 homers in May, one shy of their club record for the month from 2007. \n",
      " BREAKING OUT \n",
      " The Reds were last in the NL in hitting with a .207 team batting average in early May. They’ve scored eight or more runs in four of their last six games. \n",
      " REDS MOVES \n",
      " The Reds claimed right-hander R.J. Alaniz off waivers from the Mariners and optioned him to Triple-A Louisville. Left-handed reliever Zach Duke was reinstated from the 10-day injured list after recovering from a strained right calf. Right-handed reliever Robert Stephenson went on the injured list with a strained neck. \n",

Infielder Alex Blandino will begin a rehab assignment at Louisville on Monday. He is recovering from reconstructive surgery on his right knee last July. \n",

      " Anderson allowed two runs on five hits and threw a career-high 105 pitches to earn his first win in his fourth start -- and his first on the road -- for the Giants. The 24-year-old right-hander walked one and struck out four, lowering his ERA to 4.09. \n",

He became the first Giants starter to complete seven innings since \n",

      " “Strong kid,” manager Bruce Bochy said. “He maintained his stuff. He was still hitting 94 [mph] up there in that last inning. He had good stuff. Good movement on the fastball. Good slider. He just pitched well. It was good to see that. We haven’t had a lot of those, to be honest. The ’pen could have used a big break today, and he allowed us to do that. He just did a terrific job.” \n",
      " Anderson’s quality start came two days after fellow rookie \n",
      " Tyler Beede \n",
      " delivered six innings of one-run ball against the Marlins, an encouraging sign for the Giants, who are increasingly looking toward the future after their 23-34 start to the season. \n",
      " Those performances have helped stoke optimism that the Giants’ rotation can turn it around after logging an ugly 7.32 ERA in May, the highest for the club in any single month since it moved to San Francisco in 1958. It also marked the highest monthly ERA by a team’s starting staff since the A’s rotation posted an 8.25 ERA in September 2015. \n",
      " Anderson wasn’t immune to those struggles, yielding six runs (four earned) over five innings against the D-backs in his previous start on Sunday. \n",
      " After the rough showing, Anderson sat down with pitching coaches Curt Young and Matt Herges and catcher Posey to work on refining his location. (Posey, who homered in the third inning as the designated hitter, left the game after developing right hamstring soreness in the seventh. Bochy said Posey is considered day to day.) \n",
      " “I had a couple [of] missed locations last outing,” Anderson said. “We broke it down and talked about why they were missed, and why the result was how it was. Going into this game, I just knew I had to locate.” \n",
      " Anderson looked sharp from the outset against the Orioles, retiring the first six batters he faced. He opened his start with three scoreless innings before Renato Nunez drove a first-pitch fastball over the left-field fence to put Baltimore on the board in the fourth. The Orioles scored their only other run off Anderson in the fifth after Stevie Wilkerson drew a leadoff walk and scored on Austin Wynns’ two-out RBI single. \n",
      " Anderson had never thrown more than 102 pitches in his professional career, but Bochy chose to send him out for the seventh with his pitch count at 84. He subsequently found himself locked in an 11-pitch battle against Wilkerson, who fouled off six pitches before striking out swinging on a 92-mph fastball. \n",
      " “I knew my pitch count was going up, and I knew I wanted to get through that seventh,” Anderson said. “He was taking me away from that. I knew I had to bear down and make sure I made pitches. I located that last fastball, and he swung through it.” \n",
      " Anderson then struck out Rio Ruiz swinging on another fastball and coaxed a groundout from Hanser Alberto to cap his outing. \n",
      " “I thought he had a good look about him in that seventh inning,” Bochy said. “He wasn’t looking for help. I do think he has an edge to him. You can tell, he’s a really good competitor.” \n",

      " Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Tanner Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Washington Nationals to a 5-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in a stadium where they've dominated. \n",
      " Washington has won nine of its last 10 at Great American Ball Park. Overall, the Nationals are 17-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason. Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 35 1/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. \n",
      " Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",

      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Eric Fedde, who escaped a pair of bases-loaded threats in his four-plus innings. The Nationals turned double plays in the first, third and fifth innings to blunt rallies. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Tanner Rainey, the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " Rainey (1-1) got into the game in the fifth inning and fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. He hadn't allowed a pair of homers in his last 13 starts. \n",

      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The Minnesota Twins are a hit — and getting hit. \n",
      " Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and the Twins beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-3 Friday night in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game lead in the AL Central. \n",
      " \"We don't want our guys getting nicked up or anything, but sometimes you take the baserunners any way you can,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"And sometimes it takes a base hit with men on base to kind of wake everyone up and get things going.\" \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",
      " \"It's something we've seen this year. In the games that we have not played our best or lost, we've come back the day after and really pulled together and played good baseball,\" Baldelli said. \"It's what we've come to expect. I think we have the type of guys that regardless of what happens today, they'll be ready to play tomorrow.\" \n",
      " Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " The Twins have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. They trailed 3-1 in the fifth before Polanco drove in a run with his second double and scored on a single by Willians Astudillo. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout. Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo plunked Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " Kolarek, a left-hander, relieved to face the left-handed hitting Rosario, and Rosario grounded an opposite-field single to left, past the spot vacated when third baseman Christian Arroyo shifted toward shortstop. \n",
      " Rogers (2-1) retired his first six batters, allowed Daniel Robertson's two-out single in the ninth, then retired Mike Zunino on a groundout. \n",
      " Berríos struck out eight in 6 2/3 innings, allowing three runs and three hits. \n",
      " Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. \n",
      " Astudillo had an RBI single in the first, but Kevin Kiermaier's two-run homer in the second put the Rays ahead. Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",
      " Astudillo was thrown out at the plate by Kiermaier while trying to score on C.J. Cron's two-out double to center. \n",
      " SCARY \n",
      " Rays pitcher Emilio Pagán was hit on the right cheek by a line drive off Schoop's bat in the sixth but remained in the game. \n",
      " \"I was lucky,\" Pagan said. \"Probably my No. 1 fear, most pitchers will agree, that a ball coming back at you is not a fun situation to be in. It could have gotten me on my hand a lot more serious, and it definitely could have hit me in the face a lot harder.\" \n",
      " SHORT BENCH \n",
      " Tampa Bay played with C Travis d'Arnaud as the only healthy backup. Outfielders Tommy Pham (right leg cramp) and Avisail Garcia (overall body soreness/hamstrings) were limited to pinch hitting. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Twins: Polanco was at DH after missing Thursday's game due to illness. \n",
      " Rays: C Zunino (strained left quadriceps) was reinstated from the 10-day IL and C Erik Kratz was designated for assignment. ... INF Yandy Díaz (bruised left hand) was sent to extended spring training. ... INF Matt Duffy, out all season with a strained left hamstring, said a specialist he saw this week found no structural damage. Duffy could resume jogging Monday. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " RHP Kyle Gibson (5-2, 4.08) is to start Saturday for the Twins and RHP Yonny Chirinos (6-1. 2.91) for the Rays. \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",

      " BALTIMORE (AP) — Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the center field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.’s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " “I feel like every time he is around I do something,” the younger Smith said. “He’s a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.” \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " “It’s been a rough couple of months,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “We’ve had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.” \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " “A great day by the kid,” Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. “He’s done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.” \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith’s grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz’s ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn’t allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " “It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,” Cashner said. “I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.” \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles’ bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year’s Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. “Nothing’s really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,” Elias said. ... The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",

      " NSRI Richards Bay duty crew were activated just before 8am on Friday following reports of a 21-foot commercial fishing ski-boat capsized 1.5 nautical miles off-shore of Mtunzini main beach with six crew members on board, NSRI Richards Bay duty coxswain Norman Rautenbach said. \n",
      " The NSRI sea rescue craft Spirit of Round Table II was launched, while the NSRI rescue vehicle, ambulance services, police and a police search and rescue unit, and fire and rescue services responded, he said. \n",
      " \"On arrival on the scene, it was initially suspected [that] two of six crew who were on the boat when it reportedly capsized were still missing and four crew were on the shore, where sadly, one crew member, a 41-year-old local man, was confirmed to be deceased.\" \n",
      " It was then confirmed that the two men reported to be missing were both safe ashore, bringing all crew on board accounted for. Two of the five survivors were transported to hospital by ambulance and were in a stable condition, Rautenbach said. \n",

      " The NSRI, police, and the emergency services expressed condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of the deceased fisherman. The NSRI righted the capsized boat at sea and towed it ashore, where it had been taken into the care of police and Samsa officials, he said. \n",

      " The Marlins sent 11 batters to the plate in the fourth, with Garrett Cooper hitting two singles, driving in one run and scoring one run. The first six Marlins batters reached to knock out rookie lefty Nick Margevicius and give the Marlins a 4-2 lead. Ramirez's two-run double was followed by RBI singles by Martin Prado and Miguel Rojas. Luis Perdomo came on and got two outs before first baseman Eric Hosmer's error loaded the bases. Cooper followed with an RBI single. \n",

      " “Not trying to do too much,” he explained. \n",
      " And yet he’s doing plenty. \n",
      " Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and the host Colorado Rockies beat the slumping Toronto Blue Jays 13-6 on Friday for their sixth straight win. \n",
      " It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, whose 15 homers tied him with J.J. Hardy (2007) for the most by an NL shortstop before June in a single season, according to the Rockies. \n",
      " Story also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. Arenado batted .425 in May. \n",
      " “We do have a good lineup,” said manager Bud Black, whose team’s 183 runs in May is tied for the fourth-most for a month in team history. “I think it’s deep. It has speed. It has power. It has average.” \n",
      " For a change, Colorado didn’t have to fret late in the game after jumping out to an early 10-2 lead. The Rockies have four walk-off wins in going 7-1 so far on this season-high, 10-game homestand. \n",

      " BLOOMINGTON — In a heavyweight bout between state-ranked teams, Edwardsville’s Drake Westcott delivered the two biggest blows and it knocked out Normal West’s season. \n",
      " Westcott hit a grand slam in the second inning and added a two-run shot in the sixth inning for good measure to send the state’s second-ranked Tigers to a 12-8 victory over the 12th-ranked Wildcats on Saturday at Illinois Wesleyan’s Horenberger Field in the championship game of the Bloomington Class 4A Sectional. \n",
      " “Each time they were able to put up runs we were able to battle right back. This was a hard-fought win,” said Westcott, who finished 2 for 3 with the two homers and six RBIs. \n",
      " It is the second sectional championship in three seasons for Edwardsville, which defeated Normal West 7-0 in 2017’s sectional title game. It is the state-record 18th sectional championship for the Edwardsville program. \n",
      " “It’s all about winning and advancing. This wasn’t the prettiest game. It was a knockdown, drag-out battle,” Tigers coach Tim Funkhouser said. \n",
      " Winners of seven straight, Edwardsville (34-5) plays seventh-ranked Chicago Marist (27-10) at 6 p.m. Monday in the Springfield Super-Sectional at Lincoln Land Community College. Marist won the Lockport Sectional with a 9-5 victory over Providence Catholic. \n",
      " Normal West ends its season at 30-7, a win shy of its first sectional championship since 2005. The Wildcats have lost in three straight sectional championship games. \n",
      " “Both teams delivered punches. It was a heavyweight bout for a while. Tim has a great program over there and I have the ultimate respect for him,” Normal West coach Chris Hawkins said. \n",
      " Saturday’s game featured 20 runs, 20 hits and 10 walks. The two biggest hits belonged to Westcott, who entered Saturday’s game hitting .370 with six home runs and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " After Edwardsville rallied from a two-run deficit to take a 3-2 lead with a two-run double from Joe Copeland in the first and an RBI double from Logan Cromer in the second, Westcott walked to the plate with the bases loaded with one out in the second. \n",
      " “I don’t know if it takes guts or intelligence or nerve to walk him with the bases loaded, but it has always crossed my mind. Everybody says don’t pitch to Westcott. With the bases loaded, that’s tough to do,” Hawkins said. “When it comes down to it, we’re 30-6 for a reason and I’ll go down with the ship because we’re going to fight and claw.” \n",
      " On a 1-1 pitch, Westcott lined a grand slam over the 365-foot sign in right center to put the Tigers ahead 7-2. It was the second grand slam of Westcott’s career. He hit a walk-off slam against Granite City on March 28, 2018. \n",
      " “I got a pitch on the outside half of the plate — it was a fastball - and I hit it a long way,” Westcott said. “That was a huge momentum shift for the team.” \n",
      " After rallying for its previous two wins, Normal West didn’t go away. The Wildcats pulled to within 7-6 after scoring two runs in the third and fourth innings. \n",
      " In the bottom of the fourth, Edwardsville plated three runs on an RBI single from Copeland and a two-run single from Dalton Wallace, who battled back from an 0-2 count with two outs, for the 10-6 lead. \n",
      " “We had contributors throughout the way,” Funkhouser said. “This was a great team effort.” \n",
      " Normal West scored two more runs in the fifth, but couldn’t get any closer as reliever Collin Salter shut the Wildcats down in the sixth. Westcott delivered the nail in the coffin with a two-run home run to deep right field for the 12-8 lead. \n",
      " “It was a hanging curveball on the inner-half and I put a good swing on it and hit it a long way. Once we got that, you could kind of tell that they were down,” Westcott said. \n",
      " Finishing with six RBIs, Westcott tied a career high. It was his second multi-homer game of the season. \n",
      " “He put a good swing on a couple of pitches and we were able to get rewarded. That was a big punch we needed,” Funkhouser said. \n",
      " Salter finished off the win in the seventh, getting a double play to end it. After watching Normal West score eight runs on seven hits off starting pitcher Grant Schaefer and reliever Dawson Taylor, Salter threw two scoreless innings with two hits allowed. \n",
      " “They’re a good hitting team. If you leave the ball up, they are going to hit it. I had to keep the ball down. I was just doing my job and going out there and trying to close out the game,” Salter said. \n",
      " It was Salter’s third save of the season. \n",
      " Schaefer earned the win. He allowed six runs (four earned) on five hits with four strikeouts and four walks in 3.1 innings. His defense made two errors behind him, leading to the two first-inning runs. \n",
      " “Grant pitched better than what showed. Our defense was giving them more outs. He probably threw six innings worth of outs,” Funkhouser said. \n",
      " The Tigers banged out 11 hits, including five for extra bases. Copeland was 2 for 4 with three RBIs, while Burris, Wallace and Westcott added two hits apiece. The top of the order — Hayden Moore, Burris and Westcott — combined to score nine of the team’s 12 runs. They went 5 for 8 with two homers and a double. \n",
      " Austin Collinson had three hits and Sean Shook added two hits and two RBIs for the Wildcats. \n",

      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Tanner Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Washington Nationals to a 5-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in a stadium where they've dominated. \n",
      " Washington has won nine of its last 10 at Great American Ball Park. Overall, the Nationals are 17-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason. Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 35 1/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. \n",
      " Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Eric Fedde, who escaped a pair of bases-loaded threats in his four-plus innings. The Nationals turned double plays in the first, third and fifth innings to blunt rallies. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Tanner Rainey, the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " Rainey (1-1) got into the game in the fifth inning and fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. He hadn't allowed a pair of homers in his last 13 starts. \n",
      " Washington's Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. \n",

      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - The Minnesota Twins are a hit - and getting hit. \n",
      " Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and the Twins beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-3 Friday night in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " AlertMe \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game lead in the AL Central. \n",
      " \"We don't want our guys getting nicked up or anything, but sometimes you take the baserunners any way you can,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"And sometimes it takes a base hit with men on base to kind of wake everyone up and get things going.\" \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",
      " \"It's something we've seen this year. In the games that we have not played our best or lost, we've come back the day after and really pulled together and played good baseball,\" Baldelli said. \"It's what we've come to expect. I think we have the type of guys that regardless of what happens today, they'll be ready to play tomorrow.\" \n",
      " Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " The Twins have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. They trailed 3-1 in the fifth before Polanco drove in a run with his second double and scored on a single by Willians Astudillo. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout. Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo plunked Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " Kolarek, a left-hander, relieved to face the left-handed hitting Rosario, and Rosario grounded an opposite-field single to left, past the spot vacated when third baseman Christian Arroyo shifted toward shortstop. \n",
      " Rogers (2-1) retired his first six batters, allowed Daniel Robertson's two-out single in the ninth, then retired Mike Zunino on a groundout. \n",
      " Berríos struck out eight in 6 2/3 innings, allowing three runs and three hits. \n",
      " Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. \n",
      " Astudillo had an RBI single in the first, but Kevin Kiermaier's two-run homer in the second put the Rays ahead. Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",
      " Astudillo was thrown out at the plate by Kiermaier while trying to score on C.J. Cron's two-out double to center. \n",
      " SCARY \n",
      " Rays pitcher Emilio Pagán was hit on the right cheek by a line drive off Schoop's bat in the sixth but remained in the game. \n",
      " \"I was lucky,\" Pagan said. \"Probably my No. 1 fear, most pitchers will agree, that a ball coming back at you is not a fun situation to be in. It could have gotten me on my hand a lot more serious, and it definitely could have hit me in the face a lot harder.\" \n",
      " SHORT BENCH \n",
      " Tampa Bay played with C Travis d'Arnaud as the only healthy backup. Outfielders Tommy Pham (right leg cramp) and Avisail Garcia (overall body soreness/hamstrings) were limited to pinch hitting. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Twins: Polanco was at DH after missing Thursday's game due to illness. \n",
      " Rays: C Zunino (strained left quadriceps) was reinstated from the 10-day IL and C Erik Kratz was designated for assignment. ... INF Yandy Díaz (bruised left hand) was sent to extended spring training. ... INF Matt Duffy, out all season with a strained left hamstring, said a specialist he saw this week found no structural damage. Duffy could resume jogging Monday. \n",

Not only did he collect three hits for the third time this season, but Smith also homered for the second time in three games. The 2017 fourth rounder impressed last year during his first full season and hit .302 with 25 homers over two levels and was promoted to Double-A for the 2019 campaign. \n",

The 20-year-old has pitched to a 4.11 ERA through 35 innings in his first season with Frederick and has 59 strikeouts compared to 22 walks. Hall was one of the top high school lefties in the 2017 Draft, and the Orioles kept him on pitch counts in his 2018 full-season debut. The organization is likely to manage his workload again this season, which is the five innings matches his season high. \n",

      " Houck has struggled in May. The 22-year-old had given up 17 runs over five starts (24 1/3 innings) in the month entering play, but everything changed on Friday night. Houck put together his best starts since throwing back-to-back scoreless gems in late April. Houck, a first-round pick from the 2017 Draft, actually looked like he was in store for another rough outing. Binghamton loaded the bases with no outs in the first, but Houck was able to get a strikeout and then induce a ground-ball double play to get out of the jam. He went on to throw 60 of his 99 pitches for strikes and pick up his fifth win of the season. Dalbec, who is hitting .247 this season, hit .257 with 32 homers in 2018. \n",

      " Abreu retired 12 of the final 13 batters he faced, but it was clear way earlier in the game that the 23-year-old had everything working. Abreu threw 55 of his 84 pitches for strikes in what his first scoreless start of the year. Abreu, whom the Yankees acquired in a 2016 trade with the Astros, has plus stuff, but struggles with consistency and command. In fact, in his start prior to Friday, he walked six and gave up six runs over five innings. After a couple of stints with the Yankees, Adams made his first Triple-A start since May 7 and picked up his third win of the season.

The 19-year-old, a 2018 first-round pick, is hitting .223 through his first 38 games after hitting .274 in his professional debut. While Naylor has struggled at the plate this season, he was considered one of the better high school hitters in last year's Draft, so it's expected he'll turn it around. \n",

Back with the Blue Rocks, Hicklen got off to a slow start this season, but has begun to pick things up. After hitting .204 in April, Hicklen hit .279 in May.

Hernandez, whom the Rangers signed in 2013, has electric stuff and clearly has no problem generating strikeouts, but has struggled with command this season and throughout his career.

      " The Baltimore Orioles can clinch their first series win in more than a month when they host the San Francisco Giants on Saturday. \n",
      " The Orioles took the opening game 9-6 on Friday night and will send right-hander David Hess (1-6, 6.71 ERA) out for the middle game in the series. Their last series win came April 22-24 against the Chicago White Sox . \n",
      " Hess, who will face the Giants for the first time in his career, is looking for his first win since April 1 and has allowed four earned runs or more in six of his past nine starts. In his most recent outing, he gave up five runs (four earned) on nine hits in 5 2/3 innings of a no-decision against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday. He struck out Nolan Arenado twice and Trevor Story three times. \n",
      " \"That's a confidence boost to me,\" Hess told MLB.com regarding his work against the pair of hard-hitting Rockies. \"Those are two guys that are really good, quality hitters, so to go out there to get that result was really big in the situation it happened in as well.\" \n",
      " Hess, who bounced back from a disastrous May 21 outing against the New York Yankees in which he gave up nine runs on eight hits over five innings, has given up 18 homers, tied for the major league lead, over 11 games. \n",
      " San Francisco right-hander Shaun Anderson (0-1, 4.80 ERA) will make his fourth major league start and first against the Orioles on Saturday. \n",
      " Anderson, 24, has gone five innings in each of his first three outings. In his latest start, he took the loss after allowing six runs (four earned) and nine hits against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday. \n",
      " \"They're a really aggressive team,\" Anderson told MLB.com. \"I made some bad pitches early, and they got to them.\" \n",
      " Most of the damage was done in the first two innings, when the Diamondbacks scored five runs. \n",
      " \"Anderson was up today early,\" manager Bruce Bochy told reporters after the game. \"Along with the hits, the mistakes he made, now you throw in bad defense, and that's a recipe for what happened today.\" \n",
      " The Giants' first game at Camden Yards since 2004 got off to a fast start Friday night as the teams combined for 11 first-inning runs. The Orioles rallied from a 5-0, first-inning deficit to win their eighth home game in 29 tries. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr . clubbed his first career grand slam for the Orioles in a six-run bottom of the first, and Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered. \n",
      " \"It's been a rough couple of months,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde told reporters. \"We've had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.\" \n",

It’s only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",
      " Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto’s 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. \n",
      " Cincinnati’s Joey Votto returned after missing three games with a tight right hamstring and had three hits. Eugenio Suarez was back in the lineup after getting hit on the left hand by Clay Holmes’ pitch on Wednesday. \n",
      " Twins 5, Rays 3 \n",
      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. – Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking, two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and Minnesota beat Tampa Bay in a matchup of two of the major leagues’ hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10  1/2-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " Jose Berrios and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " Rockies 13, Blue Jays 6 \n",
      " DENVER – Trevor Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and the Colorado Rockies beat the slumping Toronto Blue Jays for their sixth straight win. \n",
      " It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. \n",
      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",
      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2  1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who’ve dropped eight of their last nine games. \n",
      " Orioles 9, Giants 5 \n",
      " BALTIMORE – Dwight Smith’s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home as the teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith’s grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " Richard Bleier got five outs for his second save. \n",
      " White Sox 2, Indians 1 \n",
      " CHICAGO – Dylan Covey pitched six effective innings for his first win since August, and the White Sox beat sloppy Cleveland for their season-high fifth straight win. \n",
      " Charlie Tilson hit a two-run double to get Chicago’s offense rolling. Tilson, Yoan Moncada, Yonder Alonso and Yolmer Sanchez each had two hits. The win moved the White Sox into a second-place tie in the AL Central with Cleveland. \n",
      " The Indians committed four errors. Four of Chicago’s six runs against slumping Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer were unearned. \n",
      " Covey (1-4) settled down after allowing a leadoff homer to Francisco Lindor and scattered eight hits and ended a personal six-game losing streak. Josh Osich and Juan Minaya followed with three innings of one-hit relief. \n",
      " Bauer (4-5) allowed nine hits and struck out eight in seven innings, but shaky fielding doomed the right-hander. \n",
      " Tigers 8, Braves 2 \n",
      " ATLANTA – Niko Goodrum homered twice and had a career-high five hits, Nicholas Castellanos and Grayson Greiner also went deep, and the Detroit Tigers romped past the Braves. \n",
      " Spencer Turnbull (3-4) pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just five hits and one earned run in dealing the Braves their third straight loss at SunTrust Park. \n",
      " Goodrum, who came into the night hitting just .208, launched a 419-foot drive that nearly went into the Chop House restaurant above the right-field seats in the third inning. He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",
      " After two straight strong starts, Atlanta’s Mike Foltynewicz (1-4) had another rough night. Foltynewicz surrendered seven hits and five runs in five innings. \n",
      " Atlanta has been outscored 22-6 in its last two defeats. \n",
      " Rangers 6, Royals 2 \n",
      " ARLINGTON, Texas – Joey Gallo’s first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth-inning outburst as the Rangers rallied past the Kansas City Royals. \n",
      " Gallo’s home run, his team leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. He allowed two runs on five hits and three walks and had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks – both in the sixth. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17  1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City’s other run. Adalberto Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base, giving the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",
      " Cardinals 2, Cubs 1, 10 innings \n",
      " ST. LOUIS – Matt Carpenter hit a game-ending single against an unusual defensive alignment in the 10th to lead the Cardinals past the Chicago Cubs. \n",
      " The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage for May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). They went 8-18 in May 1980. \n",
      " Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter’s clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team’s lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter, and put four players on the right side of the infield. But Carpenter drove in Wong with a fly ball that found the grass in the left field corner. \n",
      " Carlos Martinez pitched a perfect eighth for St. Louis, and Jordan Hicks (2-2) worked two scoreless innings. The last pitch Hicks threw in the ninth registered at 104.3 mph, which is the fastest in baseball this season. \n",
      " Mariners 4, Angels 3 \n",
      " SEATTLE – Jay Bruce hit his 300th career home run, Tom Murphy had a two-run shot and an RBI double, and the Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels. \n",
      " Bruce’s seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles, achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a dental procedure) and the Angels’ Albert Pujols. \n",
      " The win snapped the Angels’ three-game winning streak and wasted a fairly strong start by the Angels’ Tyler Skaggs (4-5), who gave up just five hits but made a handful of costly mistakes while giving up four runs in seven innings. \n",
      " The Angels briefly got to Mike Leake (4-6) in the sixth inning when Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani hit back-to-back home runs to left field with two outs. It was the first time Los Angeles has hit consecutive home runs this season, but it wasn’t enough for the Angels. \n",
      " Padres 5, Marlins 2 \n",
      " SAN DIEGO – Franmil Reyes, Hunter Renfroe and Ian Kinsler homered, and left-hander Joey Lucchesi combined with two relievers on a four-hitter for his first victory in six starts to lead the Padres past the Miami Marlins. \n",
      " Lucchesi (4-3) hadn’t won since beating Cincinnati at home on April 21. He retired his first seven batters before allowing a double by Miguel Rojas in the third. He then retired eight straight before allowing a home run by pinch-hitter Rosell Herrera with one out in the sixth. Lucchesi struck out five and walked one. \n",
      " Craig Stammen pitched 1  2/3 hitless innings, Phil Maton allowed two singles to open the Marlins’ ninth and Kirby Yates came on to get the final three outs for his 22nd save, best in the majors. \n",
      " Herrera was pinch-hitting for lefty Caleb Smith (3-3), who lost his third straight decision after allowing two runs and three hits in five innings. \n",
      " Dodgers 6, Phillies 3 \n",
      " LOS ANGELES – Max Muncy, Joc Pederson, Corey Seager and Enrique Hernandez homered, powering Los Angeles past Philadelphia in the opener of a series matching the National League’s best teams. \n",
      " The West-leading Dodgers improved to a major league-best 23-7 at home and have won 11 of their last 15 at Chavez Ravine against the East-leading Phillies. The Dodgers’ 39 victories lead the NL. Los Angeles rapped out 12 hits while limiting the Phillies to five, including two in the ninth. \n",
      " Kenta Maeda (7-2) allowed two runs and three hits in six innings and won his fourth straight start. He struck out six and walked none. Kenley Jansen earned his 17th save. \n",
      " Muncy and Seager belted two-run shots and Pederson had a solo homer off Jake Arrieta (5-5), who gave up five runs and 10 hits in five innings, striking out three and walking one. \n",
      " Philadelphia’s Bryce Harper, Andrew McCutchen and Rhys Hoskins combined to go 2 for 12. McCutchen homered to lead off the fourth. \n",
      " Astros 3, Athletics 2 \n",
      " OAKLAND, Calif. – Derek Fisher hit a tiebreaking homer to lead off the eighth inning for his first long ball of the season and the short-handed Houston Astros rallied to beat the Athletics. \n",
      " The Astros trailed the A’s 2-0 heading into the seventh inning on a night they were missing injured stars Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and George Springer. But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A’s their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. \n",
      " Hector Rondon (3-1) pitched out of a jam in the seventh with help from a diving stop at shortstop by defensive replacement Jack Mayfield that held Ramon Laureano at third base with the infield drawn in. Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. \n",
      " Houston’s Josh Reddick snapped an 0-for-15 rut with a solo homer. \n",
      " Mets 5, Diamondbacks 4 \n",
      " PHOENIX – Carlos Gomez snapped a tie with a pinch-hit double during New York’s bizarre two-run eighth inning, sending the Mets past the Arizona Diamondbacks. \n",
      " Todd Frazier and Adeiny Hechavarria sparked New York’s winning rally with consecutive two-out singles off Matt Andriese (3-4), putting runners on first and third. Pinch hitter J.D. Davis then hit a chopper toward the mound that bounced off Andriese’s glove as he reached up. Marte could not handle the ball cleanly as the tying run scored. Gomez followed with a grounder inside the bag at third that drove in Hechavarria, but the ball boy stationed down the line – Arizona uses seniors dubbed “Golden Glovers” – fielded the ball thinking it was foul, and Davis was not permitted to score. \n",
      " Zack Wheeler (5-3) struck out nine in seven innings, and Robert Gsellman got three outs for his first save. \n",
      " Arizona lost its fifth straight game, matching a season high. Christian Walker and Ketel Marte homered for the Diamondbacks. \n",

      " The Quinnipiac baseball team hasn’t been in the NCAA Division I baseball tournament since 2005, but the Bobcats might be staying around for a while as the Bobcats upset No. 10 national seed East Carolina 5-4 in its tourney opener. It was Quinnipiac’s first NCAA tournament win since winning two games in the 1984 Division II tournament. \n",
      " Colin Donnelly got ECU’s dangerous No. 3 hitter Alec Burleson to ground out with two runners on for the game’s final out as Quinnipiac advances to meet Campbell in the winner’s bracket. \n",
      " Liam Scafariello’s tape-measure two-run homer in the top of the seventh inning on a 3-0 pitch gave the visiting Bobcats the 5-3 lead. \n",
      " Chris Enns pitched into the seventh inning. He allowed one earned run, struck out six and walked one in an impressive 111-pitch effort. \n",
      " Quinnipiac had a chance to add to the lead as the Bobcats loaded the bases with nobody out in the eighth inning, but reliever Burleson struck out the side to keep it a two-run game. The Pirates then pulled within a run on pinch hitter Bryson Worrell’s solo homer in the bottom of the eighth. Andre Marrero came a couple of inches short of restoring the two-run lead as his two-out fly ball in the top of the ninth was caught at the wall. \n",
      " Ian Ostberg’s ground out drove in Marrero for Quinnipiac’s first run and then Evan Vulgamore homered to put the Bobcats up 2-0 in the first inning. \n",

      " ECU made it 3-3 with Thomas Francisco’s RBI single in the fourth. The Bobcats had a chance to go back in front when Vulgamore led off the sixth with a triple. He did not attempt to score on a ground out to first base and was thrown out at home by Burleson after a fly out by Kevin Huscher. \n",

Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn, who is projected as the No. 3 overall pick in the upcoming Major League Baseball draft according to a mock draft posted on the www.mlb.com site on Friday, was held hitless by Curtin and Gallagher. \n",
      " Matthews had three of the 10 hits while Chandler Debrosse and Dewaine had two hits each for CCSU which was 0-11 in the NCAA Division I tournament including Friday’s 11-5 loss to host Arkansas.

      " The second day of NCAA regionals brought an early exit for the defending national champion, one of the greatest individual performances in tournament history and an upset that put upstart Illinois State a win away from its first super regional. \n",
      " Oregon State was eliminated on its home field with a 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton, marking the first time the Beavers have gone 0-2 in regionals in 14 appearances since 1985. They were knocked out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",
      " \"It was a matter of us not playing good baseball. That's the bottom line,\" OSU interim coach Pat Bailey said. \n",
      " The Beavers lost 10 of their last 15 games and finished 36-20-1 a season after they completed a two-year run in which it won 111 of 130 games under former coach Pat Casey. \n",
      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman's last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " In Los Angeles, Baylor's Shea Langeliers hit three home runs and doubled while going 5 for 6 and driving in a tournament-record 11 runs in a 24-6 win over Omaha in an elimination game. \n",
      " \"When I was a little kid, I liked to think I was a pretty good hitter, but I think this game will probably be one of the most meaningful games for me as a hitter probably for the rest of my career,\" Langeliers said. \"Our backs were up against the wall and we needed a big game from our offense and we got it. It was a lot of fun.\" \n",
      " Langeliers, who likely will be the second catcher drafted behind Rutschman, broke the NCAA postseason record of 10 RBIs in a game shared by Vanderbilt's Connor Kaiser (2018) and Miami's Kevin Brown (2001). \n",
      " Langeliers' homers were for two, one and three runs. He also had a two-run single and three-run double. \n",
      " Illinois State sprung a surprise by beating No. 7 national seed Louisville 4-2 on the Cardinals' home field to move within one win of making its first super regional. \n",
      " The Redbirds (36-24) continued their surge under first-year coach Steve Holm, who took over a team that went 22-30 a year ago and led them to a share of the Missouri Valley Conference title. \n",
      " Other national seeds that lost and face elimination Sunday: No. 3 Georgia Tech, No. 4 Georgia, No. 10 East Carolina and No. 15 West Virginia. \n",
      " HE DID IT AGAIN \n",
      " Down to his last strike with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Steven Williams hit a three-run homer to give Auburn a 6-5 walk-off win over Georgia Tech. Williams, the Tigers' 8-hole hitter, homered and drove in five runs Friday against Coastal Carolina. \n",
      " HE DID IT AGAIN, TOO \n",
      " Florida State's Tim Becker, the graduate student who walked on after playing three seasons on the school's club team, homered for the third time in two games in a 12-3 win over Georgia. \n",
      " FSU is a win away from super regionals in Mike Martin's 40th and final season. The Seminoles, a No. 3 regional seed for the first time under Martin and one of the last four teams selected for the tournament, have scored 25 runs in two games. \n",
      " THAT'S QUINNIPIAC, MAC \n",
      " No. 4 regional seed Quinnipiac upset East Carolina 5-4 in a first-round game postponed until Saturday. The Bobcats of Hamden, Connecticut, play third-seeded Campbell in a winners' bracket game Sunday. Quinnipiac went 0-2 in its only previous tournament appearance in 2005. \n",

      " Dolphins downed by Dunedin 7-4 in state semis \n",
      "  \n",
      " DUSTIN KENT Sports Editor   @PCNHDustinKent \n",
      " Friday \n",
      " May 31, 2019 at 4:39 PM May 31, 2019 at 4:39 PM \n",
      " Mosley’s quest for a state championship came to an end Friday with a 7-4 defeat at the hands of Dunedin in the Class 6A state semifinals in Fort Myers. \n",
      " The Dolphins’ season ended at 25-4, while the Falcons (23-8) advanced to Saturday’s state title game against Jesuit, which defeated Miami Springs in Friday’s other semifinal. \n",
      " It was a relatively even game statistically between the Dolphins and Falcons, with Dunedin managing just one more hit while committing one more error. \n",
      " But it was a two-out, three-run rally in the bottom of the fifth inning that proved to be the difference for the Falcons, who held off a late Mosley rally by limiting a bases-loaded with one out situation in the seventh to just a single run. \n",
      " Missed opportunities were a theme for the Dolphins on Friday, as they left 10 runners on base for the game. \n",
      " \"It’s just one of those games where every time it seemed like we had a big inning going something came along and stopped it,\" Mosley coach Jon Hudson said. \"We had three or four line drives that were caught. It was one thing or another that seemed like it wasn’t going our way. \n",
      " \"I really feel like if we had a nine-inning game it might be a different story, but in a seven-inning game when things like that don’t go your way it makes it tough.\" \n",
      " Mosley had two runners on with less than two outs in the first and third innings but couldn’t get a run in either instance. \n",
      " Dunedin took advantage in the home half of the third with three runs on another two-out rally, as a bases-loaded walk issued by Mosley starter Ryan Pettys to Connor Russell forced the first run of the game in, and Marcus Brodil followed with a two-RBI single to centerfield to make it 3-0. \n",
      " Clete Hartzog got the Dolphins on the board with an RBI double to score Brayden Gainey in the top of the fourth, but the Falcons took a commanding 6-1 lead with three more runs in a fifth inning featuring RBI hits by Brock Cunningham and Chris Johnson. \n",
      " A two-out, two-RBI double by Mason Smith in the sixth got Mosley back to within striking distance at 6-3. \n",
      " Dunedin tacked on an insurance run in the bottom of the sixth on a double steal that saw Noah Bukolt take home as Brodil swiped second. \n",
      " In the top of the seventh, Mosley loaded the bases with one out thanks to singles from Drew Yeager, Blake Vineyard, and Trent Justice off of Dunedin reliever Dominic Baratta. \n",
      " After a fly ball to centerfield by Gainey for the second out, Yeager scored on a passed ball to cut the margin to three. \n",
      " Pinch hitter Anderson Brooks represented the tying run at the plate, but Baratta struck him out swinging to end the game. \n",
      " \"We had a chance early in the game and some opportunities to score, and then they turn around and get the lead and we were battling from behind the rest of the game,\" Hudson said. \"We didn’t quit. The guys really fought hard. We fought as hard as we could and really gave ourselves a chance to get back in it even in the seventh inning. \n",
      " \"I’m proud of the fight when things didn’t seem to be going our way today.\" \n",
      " Tyler Vogel got the win for Dunedin for 5 2/3 innings in which he allowed three earned runs on six hits and five walks with one strikeout. \n",
      " Pettys took the loss for Mosley, surrendering three earned runs on four hits and five walks with two strikeouts in three innings. \n",
      " Johnson led the Dunedin offense, finishing 3 for 3 with a walk, a double, and an RBI, while Brodil was 2 for 3 with a walk, a run, and an RBI. \n",
      " Smith was the top hitter for the Dolphins, going 2 for 4 with a double and two RBI. Christian Lasecki also had two hits and a run. Gainey was 1 for 3 with a walk and a run. \n",
      " The loss brings to a close what looked to be another promising Mosley season that fell just short of the ultimate goal, though Hudson said it doesn’t put a damper for him on what these Dolphins accomplished in 2019. \n",
      " \"We won 25 games this year and found ways to win, and just their will to win was really as strong as any team I’ve ever had,\" he said. \"But you get to the final four and funny things happen. I really feel like we would beat (the Falcons) more than they’d beat us in a 10-game series, but that’s not what happens here. \n",
      " \"It’s one game and it just didn’t go our way. We ran out of innings to get the job done. It was a great game and we fought hard, we just couldn’t seem to get over the hump to open the floodgates for the runs I felt like we could’ve put on the board.\" \n",

      " Defending national champion Oregon State was among the first teams eliminated from the NCAA Tournament on Saturday, marking the first time the Beavers have gone 0-2 in regionals in 14 appearances since 1985. \n",
      " The Beavers' 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton, which followed a 7-6 loss to American Athletic Conference champ Cincinnati on Friday, knocked them out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",
      " Baylor's Shea Langeliers turned in one of the greatest individual postseason performances, hitting three home runs and doubling while going 5 for 6 and driving in a tournament-record 11 runs in the Bears' 24-6 win over Omaha in an elimination game. \n",
      " \"It's a pretty cool,\" Langeliers said. \"It's a team accolade. I was up in the right situations and happened to come through.\" \n",
      " Langeliers' homers were for two, one and three runs. He also had a two-run single and three-run double. \n",

      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman's last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " Illinois State continued its surge under first-year coach Steve Holm, who took over a Redbirds team that went 22-30 a year ago and led them to a share of the Missouri Valley Conference title. \n",
      " Illinois State made the most of its three hits against Louisville starter Reid Detmers. Joe Aeilts doubled in a run in the first inning and Jeremy Gaines's two-run double in the sixth broke a 2-2 tie. Matt Walker scattered six hits, walked two and struck out seven in a complete game. \n",

After the men produced some money, Hadnot opened fire, killing one man as he knelt on the ground and two other men as they fled. He wounded one man and fired at the two remaining men, who escaped unharmed. \n",
      " The three men who were murdered were David Jermaine Galmore, 23, and Jermiskian Jovan Arvie, and Fitzgerald Tremayne Guillory, both 20. \n",

      " \"They hit the mistakes,\" Kingham said. \"I feel like I got ahead early and dictated the way the counts went. They hit my mistakes. Moustakas hit a breaking ball right down the middle.

(Photo by Joe Robbins/Getty Images) \n",
      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Tanner Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Washington Nationals to a 5-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in a stadium where they've dominated. \n",
      " Washington has won nine of its last 10 at Great American Ball Park. Overall, the Nationals are 17-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason. Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 35 1/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. \n",
      " Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Eric Fedde, who escaped a pair of bases-loaded threats in his four-plus innings. The Nationals turned double plays in the first, third and fifth innings to blunt rallies. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Tanner Rainey, the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " Rainey (1-1) got into the game in the fifth inning and fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. He hadn't allowed a pair of homers in his last 13 starts. \n",
      " Washington's Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. \n",

      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. \n",
      " \"It happened so quick,\" said Corbin, who trailed 5-0 after only 21 pitches. \n",
      " Corbin was coming off one of his best performances, a four-hitter for his second career shutout against the Marlins on Saturday. His feared slider was a little off from the outset, and the Reds piled up six singles and Casali's homer in a 30-pitch first inning. \n",
      " \"That was a great first inning,\" Reds manager David Bell said. \"It was really a good offensive night for the entire team.\" \n",
      " Casali's homer was his first this season off a regular pitcher. He also connected off Cubs catcher Victor Caratini during a 10-2 win at Wrigley Field on May 26. Casali added a single and an RBI double as the Reds piled up 15 hits. \n",
      " \"I've been waiting for a swing like that for a long time,\" Casali said. \"Getting that big early spot was nice.\" \n",
      " Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",

The Indians' No. 4 prospect and first-round pick from last year's Draft scored every time he reached -- a season high --  and clubbed his first homer in three weeks. He's hitting .237/.338/.305 as a 19-year-old in his first full season of professional ball with two homers and 20 RBIs. Behind the plate, Naylor has a .983 fielding percentage and has thrown out 19 of 29 would-be basestealers. Gameday box score \n",
      " Dodgers SS Jacob Amaya, Class A Great Lakes: 3-for-4, 2 RBIs, 2B, R, BB -- After notching a pair of three-hit games in April, Amaya posted his first three-hit game of May on the month's final day. His big knock came in the fourth inning, when the 20-year-old laced a two-run double to left field. Overall, the Dodgers' 11th-ranked prospect batted .231 this month and is hitting .239 overall with three homers and 29 RBIs. Gameday box score \n",
      " Yankees P Chance Adams, Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre: 6 IP, 0 R, 3 K, 4 H, 0 BB -- Newly returned from the Major Leagues, the right-hander shoved in his first start for the RailRiders since May 7. He threw 47 of 73 pitches for strikes to improve to 3-1 on the International League season with a 4.00 ERA and 1.25 WHIP. Over Adams' last four starts, New York's No. 20 prospect has allowed three earned runs over 24 2/3 innings.  Gameday box score \n",
      " Rays SS Wander Franco, Class A Midwest League: 2-for-4, HR, 2B, 2 RBIs, R -- Already riding a seven-game hitting streak, the top Tampa Bay prospect delivered a two-hit night. After a seven-pitch at-bat in the first inning, Franco cranked a two-run homer to right field, his fifth long ball of the season. In the fifth, he went to right again and legged out his 13th double. The 18-year-old is showing no signs of slowing down in his first full professional season, boasting a .324/.391/.517 slash line.  Gameday box score \n",
      " Braves OF Trey Harris, Class A Rome: 4-for-5, 2 RBIs, R -- Harris has torn up South Atlantic League pitching all season, but Friday marked a different type of dominance for him. The Braves' No. 28 prospect stroked four hits -- all singles -- for the first time in his professional career. In the process, the University of Missouri product raised his average to .377 and his OPS to an SAL-leading 1.054.

      " Dodgers SS Gavin Lux, Double-A Tulsa: 3-for-5, R -- Lux raked seemingly from start to finish in May, so it's only fitting Los Angeles' second-ranked prospect ended the month on a high note. He collected three singles and scored once to help the Drillers get past Arkansas, 6-5. Lux has recorded six games with at least three hits this season, including four in May alone. Overall, the shortstop ranks in the top three in the Texas League with 11 homers, a .317 average and .556 slugging percentage.  Gameday box score \n",

Aside from that, Harvey was strong in throwing 58 of a season-high 89 pitches for strikes.

      " Gordon’s triple in the fifth inning turned around centerfielder Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway centre, scoring Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. \n",

      " BATON ROUGE. – With his third hit of the night, senior outfielder Antoine Duplantis tied Eddy Furniss for the LSU career hits record with 352 hits as the LSU baseball team stormed pat Stony Brook, 17-3 in the opening round of the Baton Rouge Regional Friday night in Alex Box Stadium, Skip Bertman Field. \n",
      " For the eighth consecutive year, LSU has won its regional opener. The 14-run win is the largest margin of victory in a regional opener since the Tigers opened the 2000 regional opener with a 19-1 win against Jackson State and is the fifth double-digit regional opening victory since 1996 (’97, ’98, ’00, ’08, ’19). \n",
      " LSU will meet Southern Miss at 6 p.m. CT Saturday in The Box. TV for the game is TBD, and fans can listen to the game on the LSU Sports Radio Network, including 98.1 FM in Baton Rouge. \n",
      " Freshman Landon Marceaux improved to 5-2 on the season after throwing only 53 pitches in five innings. He limited Stony Brook to two runs—one earned—on seven hits, walked one and struck out three. \n",
      " Ma’Khail Hilliard was the first Tiger out of the bullpen and he allowed one run on one hit and struck out two in the sixth. Trent Vietmeier made his first appearance back on the mound since May 10 at Arkansas. He, Chase Costello and Rye Gunter combined for the final three innings, blanking the Seawolves after allowing two hits and striking out three. \n",
      " Right-hander Greg Marino suffered the loss and fell to 5-5 after allowing seven runs—two earned—on three hits, walked three and struck out two in 1.1 innings. \n",
      " Stony Brook was first on the board in the top of the first inning. First baseman Chris Hamilton singled through the left side and moved to second on a wild pitch before scoring on an error by the shortstop. \n",
      " The Tigers erupted for five runs on two hits and one error in the bottom of the inning to make it a 5-1 game. With the bases loaded and two outs, first baseman Chris Reid drew a walk before catcher Saul Garza cleared the bases with a double down the right field line. Second baseman followed with a RBI single to center field to round out the five-run first inning. \n",
      " In the bottom of the second inning with shortstop Josh Smith on second base after a single and a stolen base, Duplantis slapped an RBI single up the middle. With runners in scoring position after a base hit by left fielder Daniel Cabrera, designated hitter Cade Beloso hit a sacrifice fly to left field to bring in Duplantis. Center fielder Zach Watson then hit a moon shot to left field for his sixth home run of the year, a two-run blast, to put the Tigers up 9-1. \n",
      " Duplantis drove in two runs in the bottom of the third with his single through the right side to extend the LSU lead to 11-1. \n",
      " With runners on first and second in the fourth, second baseman Brandt Broussard unloaded his first career home run to right field to put LSU up 13-1. \n",
      " In the top of the fifth inning, center fielder Michael Wilson drove in second baseman Brandon Janofsky on a fielder’s choice. \n",
      " With the bases in the fifth inning, Watson was hit by a pitch, Reid hit a sacrifice fly and Garza reached on a fielding error, which resulted in three runs for the Tigers to make it a 17-2 game. \n",

      " SEATTLE -- \n",
      " turned in a second straight strong outing and \n",
      " Kole Calhoun \n",
      " smacked a go-ahead two-run homer in the eighth inning to lift the Angels to a 6-3 win over the Mariners on Saturday at T-Mobile Park. The Halos have now won six of their last eight games. \n",
      " Heaney, making his second start of the season after missing the first two months with left elbow inflammation, was impressive, striking out 10 without issuing a walk over six strong innings. But he had trouble facing Edwin Encarnacion, as he gave up a solo homer to him in the fourth and a game-tying two-run blast to him in the sixth on a full count. \n",
      " • Box score \n",
      " \"I had good stuff,\" Heaney said. \"You want to get more out of days like today. Obviously, in the situation of the game, that's not what I'm trying to do there with the 3-2 pitch. He capitalized on it. Obviously, he was seeing it well. It's something I'll take a look at and going forward, I'll have to make some adjustments.\" \n",
      " That stuck Heaney with a no-decision, but Calhoun came to the rescue with his two-run homer off lefty Roenis Elias with two outs in the eighth. It was Calhoun’s 12th of the year and his fifth off a left-hander. He's been heating up, as he hit .299/.394/.552 in 25 games in May after batting .194/.281/.435 in 28 games in March/April. \n",
      " “He took a couple of good swings on fastballs prior to the home run,” manager Brad Ausmus said. “Kole has swung the bat pretty well overall recently, even against lefties. He hangs in there well.” \n",
      " Calhoun’s clutch blast helped make up for the two homers surrendered by Heaney to Encarnacion. The first one came on a 1-0 changeup, while the second was on a hanging curveball on a 3-2 count. Heaney's curveball was otherwise his best pitch, as he recorded eight of his strikeouts with it. \n",
      " “It was good today,\" Heaney said of his curve. \"I think the fastball sets it up. So I think being in the zone and getting some swing-throughs definitely puts some pressure on them to make a decision.” \n",
      " Heaney registered an impressive 22 swings and misses, including 15 with his curve and seven with his sinker. It was tied for the fifth-most swinging strikes induced by an Angels pitcher since Statcast was introduced in 2015. It set a career best for Heaney; the best by an Angels pitcher since 2015 is 25, by both Matt Shoemaker (May 27, 2016) and Shohei Ohtani (April 9, 2018). \n",

      " — Los Angeles Angels (@Angels) June 2, 2019 \n",
      " It was a similar showing to his season debut against the Rangers on Sunday, when he struck out eight over five solid innings but was hurt by a pair of solo homers. Heaney has struck out 18 in 11 innings this year, but has also allowed four homers. \n",
      " “If I keep the ball in the yard, I think I have two completely different starts,” Heaney said. “It goes from being two kinda mediocre starts to maybe two really good ones. That's obviously kind of the name of the game now, keep the ball in the yard. It's something I'll take a look at and see if there are any adjustments I need to make to do that better.\" \n",

      " in the third off lefty Tommy Milone. It was the 10th homer of the year for Pujols, marking the 19th straight year he’s hit at least that many. \n",
      " Pujols joins Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski, Eddie Murray and Barry Bonds as the only players to hit at least 10 homers in each of their first 19 seasons. No player has ever reached 20 consecutive. \n",

      " added an insurance run in the ninth on a solo shot off reliever Chasen Bradford. It was Trout’s team-leading 14th blast of the year and his second this series.

      " PITTSBURGH -- Orlando Arcia made sure the Milwaukee Brewers went home with a win after a long day. \n",
      " Arcia hit his second homer of the game, a two-run drive in the 13th inning that sent the Brewers over the Pittsburgh Pirates 12-10 on Saturday night. \n",
      " \"You don't want to play that long and not get a win,\" said Arcia, who also hit a two-run homer in the second to notch his first multi-HR game in the majors. \n",
      " Arcia's go-ahead drive came off Alex McRae (0-1), who had pitched two scoreless innings before his one mistake cost Pittsburgh. \n",
      " \"He gave us his heart,\" Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. \"He gave us his soul. He gave us everything he had.\" \n",
      " Adrian Houser (1-1) pitched two scoreless innings to help the Brewers win a gae that featured 21 total hits and lasted more than five hours. \n",
      " Milwaukee tied it in the ninth on Keston Hiura 's two-run homer with one out off Pirates closer Felipe Vazquez , who had been perfect in 14 save chances this season. \n",
      " \"Everyone knows he throws hard,\" Hiura said. \"He throws with the best of them. ... When somebody throws that hard, if you put the barrel on it, it ends to come off pretty hard as well.\" \n",
      " The 22 year-old connected on a 98-mph fastball and crushed it over the left field wall. \n",
      " \"As soon as I lifted up my leg, I knew something was going to be wrong because he hit it yesterday,\" Vazquez said. \"He hit that one. For me to go back at him, he was waiting on it. ... It was just that pitch. It was supposed to be inside and ended up in the middle.\" \n",
      " Starling Marte had four hits for Pittsburgh, including a three-run homer off Josh Hader in the eighth for a 10-8 lead. It was Hader's first blown save in 14 chances this season. \n",
      " Christian Yelich ended a 1-for-14 slump over his last six games in a big way. He hit his major league-leading 22nd homer, tripled and drove in four runs for Milwaukee. \n",
      " Mike Moustakas hit his third home run in three games for the Brewers when his 16th of the year -- a solo shot to right -- plunged into the Allegheny River in the third inning. Moustakas left in the ninth inning after suffering a right-hand bruise from being hit by a pitch. Brewers manager Craig Counsell confirmed x-rays were negative. \n",
      " Pinch-hitter Jose Osuna homered for the Pirates while Elias Diaz got three hits and drove in four runs. \n",
      " Milwaukee starting pitcher Brandon Woodruff was charged with six runs over four innings, allowing a season-high 10 hits with two walks and five strikeouts. \n",
      " KINGHAM STRUGGLES AGAIN \n",
      " Milwaukee's lineup capitalized on struggling Nick Kingham , who lasted just three innings and gave up five runs and six hits, including two home runs. The Brewers scored twice in the first, twice in the second -- on Arcia's two-run homer -- and once in the third on Moustakas' solo shot. \n",
      " \"They hit the mistakes,\" Kingham said. \"I feel like I got ahead early and dictated the way the counts went. They hit my mistakes. Moustakas hit a breaking ball right down the middle. That first pitch by Arcia I was trying to get ahead in the count, and there were a couple of other things that didn't go my way.\" \n",
      " Kingham worked out of the bullpen to begin the season but was called into a starting role due to Pittsburgh's depleted rotation. He has now failed to make it past the fourth inning in each of his four starts. The Pirates dropped to 1/3 in those games. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Brewers: LHP Gio Gonzalez (2-1, 3.19) was placed on the 10-day injured list with what manager Craig Counsell labeled \"a dead arm.\" Gonzalez was scheduled to pitch the series finale on Sunday. In a corresponding move, C Manny Pina was activated from the IL. \n",
      " Pirates: Tom Tomczyk, Pittsburgh's director of sports medicine, elaborated on the nature of RHP Keone Kela 's right shoulder discomfort that will shut him down for 10 days. \"It's general wear and tear from a thrower's shoulder,\" Tomczyk said before the game. \"There are changes within the structures that are causing him tightness, causing him discomfort that he just doesn't feel as if he can let it go and be Keone right now.\" \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",

      " LinkedIn \n",
      " BALTIMORE — Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the centre field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.’s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " “I feel like every time he is around I do something,” the younger Smith said. “He’s a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.” \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " “It’s been a rough couple of months,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “We’ve had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.” \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " “A great day by the kid,” Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. “He’s done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.” \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith’s grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz’s ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn’t allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " “It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,” Cashner said. “I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.” \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles’ bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year’s Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. “Nothing’s really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,” Elias said. … The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",

Not only did he collect three hits for the third time this season, but Smith also homered for the second time in three games. The 2017 fourth rounder impressed last year during his first full season and hit .302 with 25 homers over two levels and was promoted to Double-A for the 2019 campaign. \n",

The 20-year-old has pitched to a 4.11 ERA through 35 innings in his first season with Frederick and has 59 strikeouts compared to 22 walks. Hall was one of the top high school lefties in the 2017 Draft, and the Orioles kept him on pitch counts in his 2018 full-season debut. The organization is likely to manage his workload again this season, which is the five innings matches his season high. \n",

      " Houck has struggled in May. The 22-year-old had given up 17 runs over five starts (24 1/3 innings) in the month entering play, but everything changed on Friday night. Houck put together his best starts since throwing back-to-back scoreless gems in late April. Houck, a first-round pick from the 2017 Draft, actually looked like he was in store for another rough outing. Binghamton loaded the bases with no outs in the first, but Houck was able to get a strikeout and then induce a ground-ball double play to get out of the jam. He went on to throw 60 of his 99 pitches for strikes and pick up his fifth win of the season. Dalbec, who is hitting .247 this season, hit .257 with 32 homers in 2018. \n",

Abreu threw 55 of his 84 pitches for strikes in what his first scoreless start of the year. Abreu, whom the Yankees acquired in a 2016 trade with the Astros, has plus stuff, but struggles with consistency and command. In fact, in his start prior to Friday, he walked six and gave up six runs over five innings. After a couple of stints with the Yankees, Adams made his first Triple-A start since May 7 and picked up his third win of the season.

The 19-year-old, a 2018 first-round pick, is hitting .223 through his first 38 games after hitting .274 in his professional debut. While Naylor has struggled at the plate this season, he was considered one of the better high school hitters in last year's Draft, so it's expected he'll turn it around. \n",

Back with the Blue Rocks, Hicklen got off to a slow start this season, but has begun to pick things up. After hitting .204 in April, Hicklen hit .279 in May.

The 23-year-old, a 2017 second-round pick, is getting his first taste of the Double-A level this year and it took him a little bit of time to adjust.

The 10 strikeouts marked a season high for Hernandez, who fanned 134 over 121 1/3 innings a season ago. Hernandez, whom the Rangers signed in 2013, has electric stuff and clearly has no problem generating strikeouts, but has struggled with command this season and throughout his career. The zero walks were a first for Hernandez this season and certainly gave a glimpse into how dominant he can be when he's locating his pitches. \n",

      " SEATTLE – This was not the kind of matchup that has generally favored the Angels this season. \n",
      " First, there was a left-hander on the mound. The Angels entered Saturday with a .228 average, which ranked 26th in the major leagues, and a .703 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, which ranked 22nd, against left-handers. \n",
      " Then, there was a left-handed-batter at the plate in Kole Calhoun, who was hitting .180 (11 for 61) against left-handers and was two for 11 with two strikeouts and two walks all time against Seattle reliever Roenis Elias. \n",
      " With one vicious swing at a full-count pitch, Calhoun stuffed those odds in a shredder. The Angels right fielder drove an up-and-away 94-mph fastball over the wall in right-center field for a tiebreaking two-run home run in the eighth inning of a 6-3 victory over the Mariners in front of 28,128 in T-Mobile Park. \n",

I battled back and forth, laid off some good pitches. I got a good pitch to hit and put a good swing on it.\" \n",
      " The score was tied 3-3 when Cesar Puello led off the eighth with an infield single and Tommy La Stella singled to right. Up stepped catcher Jonathan Lucroy, who was hitless in three at-bats but has dropped all of seven sacrifice bunts in 10 big league seasons. \n",
      " \"It crossed my mind,\" manager Brad Ausmus said of bunting Lucroy, \"but he hasn't bunted much in his life. That's usually a recipe for disaster.\" \n",

      " Mike Trout homered in the ninth for a 6-3 lead, his team-leading 14th and 22nd in T-Mobile Park, the most by a visiting player. Cam Bedrosian, Ty Buttrey and Hansel Robles each threw an inning of scoreless relief behind Andrew Heaney, who delivered a second strong start after sitting out the first two months of the season because of elbow inflammation. \n",
      " Heaney gave up three runs and five hits in six innings, striking out 10 batters – eight on curveballs – and didn't walk anyone. The left-hander got swinging strikes on 22 of the 92 pitches he threw, 15 of them on his 36 breaking balls and seven on his 53 sinking fastballs. \n",
      " But Heaney made at least two glaring mistakes that were crushed by Edwin Encarnacion, who drove a 1-and-0 changeup 400 feet over the left-field wall for a home run in the fourth inning and a full-count curveball 438 feet to center field for a two-run shot that tied the score 3-3 in the sixth. \n",
      " The Angels scored twice in the first inning when David Fletcher walked and Albert Pujols hit a towering two-run home run to left for his 10th home run. \n",
      " \"Going down 1 and 0 and throwing a fastball to him is probably not a good idea,\" starter Tommy Milone said. \n",
      " The Angels pushed the lead to 3-0 in the third inning when Fletcher doubled to left field, Pujols was intentionally walked with two out and Puello hit a run-scoring double to left. \n",
      " \"Getting a win, that's all that matters,\" said Heaney, who used the words \"kind of mediocre\" to describe his first two starts, in which he has given up five runs and 10 hits – four of them home runs – struck out 18 and walked one in 11 innings. \n",
      " \"They spotted me some early runs and I kind of let them creep back into it. Not what I was trying to do, obviously. But that swing that Kole put on it ... that was awesome. That was the fatal blow, so that was good.\" \n",

      " Save \n",
      " Chatham’s potent bats were handcuffed for nearly six innings by Appomattox sophomore Cam Smith’s two-seam fastball on the outer half of the plate. \n",
      " It was a devastating pitch the Cavaliers repeatedly chased out of the zone, leaving them feeling frustrated heading back to the dugout. \n",
      " Once Smith exited the game with two outs in the sixth inning, Chatham found its opportunity to strike. And the Cavaliers didn’t miss in an electric seventh inning. \n",
      " Chatham scored four times on four hits, highlighted by Hunter Adkins’ walkoff single off the left-field wall, to rally for a dramatic 6-5 victory over the Raiders in the Region 2C championship game at Liberty Christian Academy. \n",
      " Chatham (21-4) is scheduled to host Region 2D runner-up John Battle at 6 p.m. Tuesday, while Appomattox (13-11) will play at Region 2D champion Lebanon on Tuesday. \n",
      " “I was just looking to drive something back side,” said Adkins, who went 2 for 4. “With no outs, trying to get the run in from third, go ahead, get up and win the region championship.” \n",
      " The Chatham dugout spilled onto the field and began the celebration before pinch-runner Henry Hurt could cross the plate for the thrilling triumph, a victory that seemed in doubt thanks to Smith’s dynamic pitching performance. \n",
      " The southpaw allowed two runs (one earned) on three hits and struck out nine over 5 2/3 innings. He allowed two hits in the first inning and did not surrender another hit until Adkins’ one-out single to third base in the sixth. \n",
      " Smith was lifted after throwing 112 pitches, 71 for strikes. \n",
      " “It’s been a process with him all year,” Appomattox coach Joe Caruso said. “We’ve battled some control issues at times, but to do that against that good of a team, that’s awfully impressive. Couldn’t ask for more.” \n",
      " Smith utilized his two-seam fastball on the outer half of the plate and forced the Cavaliers to chase out of the zone. That allowed him to attack the zone with his secondary pitches for the majority of his nine strikeouts. \n",
      " “It’s huge,” Smith said of his performance. “I was in a slump toward the beginning, but I’ve found it the past two or three games.” \n",
      " The Cavaliers’ first two batters of the seventh — Graham Dalton and Grayson Reed — reached against Jacob Johnson, forcing Caruso to bring in Dennis Ward to pitch. \n",
      " Matt Arnold reached on an error to load the bases and Brae Adkins drove in his 55th run of the season with a sharp-hit single to right field that scored Dalton to cut the deficit to 5-3. \n",
      " Andrew Potojecki, who also took the mound and allowed one hit over the final two innings to record the victory, flared a single to right field that scored Reed and Arnold to tie the game at 5-all. Hurt moved from first to third on the play. \n",
      " “I wasn’t really looking to hit a dink single, but whatever works honestly,” Potojecki said of his only hit of the game. “At that point, everybody’s just trying to fight, we’re trying to keep that mentality and just keep going. Just to see it drop, that’s what we needed to keep us fired up right there. That was best scenario possible.” \n",
      " The Cavaliers tallied two hits in the first inning and took a 1-0 lead after Reed tripled and scored on Arnold’s groundout to second. \n",
      " Appomattox responded with three runs on two hits and four walks in the third to take a 3-1 lead. Ward’s single drove in the first run, and Luke Olimpio and Tristan Lovins drew back-to-back bases-loaded walks. \n",
      " Adkins scored when Dalton was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded in the second to cut the Raiders’ lead to 3-2. \n",
      " Olimpio’s sacrifice fly drove in Johnny Hamlett in the fourth, and Lovins scored on Patterson’s single in the fifth to take a three-run lead that held until the fateful seventh inning. \n",
      " “It stings. It stings. You come out and you play to win,” Caruso said. “The one thing I never question is the heart our kids put into it. That’s all you can ask. After running through the tournament to get to this point, you knew pitching might be a little thin, and I think our pitching ran out of a little bit of gas. It took the whole regional tournament and six innings of the championship game, but it finally happened.” \n",

      " AP \n",
      " CINCINNATI (AP)  Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Tanner Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Washington Nationals to a 5-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in a stadium where they've dominated. \n",
      " Washington has won nine of its last 10 at Great American Ball Park. Overall, the Nationals are 17-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason. Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 36 2/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. \n",
      " Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Eric Fedde, who escaped a pair of bases-loaded threats in his four-plus innings. The Nationals turned double plays in the first, third and fifth innings to blunt rallies. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Tanner Rainey, the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " Rainey (1-1) got into the game in the fifth inning and fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. He hadn't allowed a pair of homers in his last 13 starts. \n",
      " Washington's Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. \n",

      " BALTIMORE -  (AP) -- Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the center field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.'s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",

      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games.  \n",
      " \"It's been a rough couple of months,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We've had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.\" \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " \"A great day by the kid,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.\" \n",

      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz's ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn't allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " \"It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,\" Cashner said. \"I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.\" \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles' bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year's Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J.

      " Roenis Elias whipped his head around only to watch something he didn't want to see. The echoing sound off the bat and the sheer violence of the swing from Kole Calhoun and his cartoon-sized forearms should have been enough. \n",
      " Even the announced crowd of 28,128 knew the outcome, letting out a collective gasp and groan immediately after the ball connected with Calhoun's maple bat. \n",
      " And yet, Elias couldn't help it. He glared at the baseball-sized comet until it landed in the seats in right-center. His irritated gaze had no effect on its flight path or the inevitable outcome it would yield – yet another loss for the Mariners. \n",

      " The Mariners' quest for back-to-back wins will have to start again. They are now 25-36 and sinking. \n",
      " Calhoun's 12th homer of the season broke a 3-3 tie in the eighth inning. And since he'd been relatively quiet by his standards for most of the game, Mike Trout hit a laser of a solo homer into the upper deck of left field off Chasen Bradford in the ninth inning. \n",
      " For Elias, it was the fifth time in six outings where he's allowed at least one run. He looked strong while pitching a mop-up inning Thursday, but his command issues, which have been a problem throughout his career, have arisen again. Over his past six outings and a total of 5 1/3 innings pitched, Elias has allowed eight runs (six earned) on a whopping 11 hits, including two homers. \n",
      " \"Ro was so good for us for a big chunk of April and May, and the last couple of weeks, he just hasn't been the same,\" manager Scott Servais said. \"His change-up is his go-to pitch, but he's struggled to get his curveball going and having other options against left-handed hitters.\" \n",
      " After Cesar Puello was able to beat out his soft infield ground ball off Brandon Brennan for a single, Servais brought in Elias to finish the rest of the inning. He immediately gave up a single to Tommy La Stella that moved the go-ahead run into scoring position. It appeared as though Elias would escape the situation when he got Jonathan Lucroy to ground into a 5-4-3 double play. But with two outs and Puello on third, Elias left a 3-2 fastball up over the middle of the plate. Left-on-left matchup or not, Calhoun wasn't going to miss that pitch. \n",
      " \"He competes really well,\" Servais said. \"I thought he was going to get through it when he got the big double-play ball but he couldn't get through Calhoun and it cost us.\" \n",
      " Seattle's offense, which consisted of Edwin Encarnacion, couldn't rally again. He hit a solo homer in the fourth inning and a two-run homer in the seventh – both off Angels starter Andrew Heaney to provide Seattle's runs. Not bad for a guy who had an emergency root canal. \n",
      " \"It's OK,\" he said of the tooth. \"It's still sore, but I can still play. I've been feeling it the last couple of days, but the night before was the worst part. It's still bothering me. We'll see how I feel tomorrow.\" \n",
      " But he was one of the few Mariners to figure out Heaney, who pitched six innings, allowing the three runs on five hits with no walks and 10 strikeouts. \n",
      " \"Heaney threw the ball really well today,\" Servais said. \"We knew coming into the ballgame it was going to be a challenge against him. He's deceptive. He's got a lot of ride on the ball. He's not the typical left-hander we're used to seeing. Have to give him some credit. Eddie picked us up big time.\" \n",
      " The Mariners got an uneven start from Tommy Milone. The veteran left-hander pitched 4 1/3 innings, allowing three runs (two earned) on seven hits with two walks and six strikeouts. He wasn't particularly efficient and didn't have quite the command of his previous outings. But Milone still found a way to pitch into the fifth and keeping the damage to a minimum. \n",
      " The first inning was a little shaky. Milone walked David Fletcher to start the inning and with two outs he served up a two-run homer to Albert Pujols. \n",
      " \"Early on, it took a little bit to get going,\" Milone said. \"It was a bit of a battle. After that first inning, I was able to settle down a little bit to make some better pitches.\" \n",
      " Pujols came into the game hitting .440 with (11 for 25) against Milone. \n",
      " \"Going down 1-0 on him and throwing a fastball up in the middle of the plate probably isn't a good idea, especially to him,\" Milone said. \"Career-wise, he's had me pretty good. So it's not a surprise.\" \n",

      " “You know, it’s an offensive game,” FAU coach John McCormack said. “It’s no secret we needed to pitch better. Credit to Florida State’s hitters because they did a really nice job. When they use the elements, we use the elements. We just have to pitch better.” \n",
      " The warm conditions and wind blowing out certainly aided Florida State’s output, but coach Mike Martin, retiring at the end of the season as college’s all-time winning coach, didn’t mind the help. \n",
      " “That was certainly something that we did not expect,” Martin said. “These two young men to my right [Mendoza & Becker] came up big in the RBI department and that is what we look at as competitors in getting it done in run scoring situations. This was certainly helped by a little wind, but who cares. That is called baseball.” \n",

      " Abreu goes seven in Thunder shutout \n",
      " Yankees No. 3 prospect strikes out six, gives up two hits \n",
      " Friday's start marked the second time this season Albert Abreu has walked two batters or fewer. (Michael Dill/Trenton Thunder) \n",
      " By Chris Bumbaca / MiLB.com | May 31, 2019 10:35 PM \n",
      " Feel good, pitch good. It sounds simple, but it's the truth for Albert Abreu. \n",
      " In his longest outing of the season, the Yankees' third-ranked prospect fired seven scoreless innings. He allowed two hits and two walks, striking out six, as Double-A Trenton blanked Harrisburg, 2-0, on Friday at Arm & Hammer Park. \n",
      " \"He's been getting after it,\" Thunder pitching coach Tim Norton said. \"He's been ready for the first pitch of every inning, not easing into it, just kind of getting after it right from the get-go. He settled in and got in a good rhythm.\" \n",
      " Video: Trenton's Abreu whiffs sixth \n",
      " Nationals No. 2 prospect Luis Garcia led off the game with a single to center field. From there, it was all Abreu (2-4). \n",
      " The native of the Dominican Republic didn't allow another hit until his final inning. After issuing a leadoff walk to Austin Davidson in the fourth, Abreu retired nine in a row. Nats No. 20 prospect Tres Barrera opened the seventh with a double off the wall in center, but the 23-year-old recorded three straight outs to strand Barrera at third and protect a 1-0 lead. \n",
      " Gameday box score \n",
      " Finding a way to pitch out of trouble in key spots is a vital step in his development. \n",
      " \"You're starting to see it coming out of him in big spots, making big pitches and limiting damage, which is huge,\" Norton said. \"Once in a while, you're going to have those big innings. He's getting closer and closer to consistently leave guys out there in big spots. He came off the mound fired up, and he should have been, tight game like that. It was huge.\" \n",
      " Abreu threw 55 of 84 pitches for strikes in his first scoreless start of the season. The two free passes were the fewest he's allowed since walking a pair against New Hampshire on April 24. In his previous two starts, the 6-foot-2 righty issued 10 free passes over 10 2/3 innings, including a six-walk outing on May 24 at Binghamton, where he surrendered a season-high six runs in five frames. \n",
      " \"He's put together a really good stretch the last six or seven games,\" Norton said. \"The last one was a dud, of course, with the walks and everything. But he's been in a great spot.\" \n",
      " Abreu has begun rounding into form this month. Prior to the Binghamton outing, he yielded five runs -- four earned -- over 24 2/3 innings in his previous four outings. \n",
      " Throwing the ball over the plate is always an emphasis, and Norton described Friday's performance \"a comeback start\" in that regard. \n",
      " \"Everything he has is good,\" the pitching coach said. \"He has a terrific arm, two plus off-speed pitches. They just need to show up more consistently, and they're starting to. He's not far away. It's just about being consistent. I know that's the everyday answer, but he has what it takes so that when he needs to make a pitch, he makes a pitch.\" \n",
      " Abreu lowered his ERA to 4.11 and has 43 strikeouts over 50 1/3 innings. On Friday, his 65-grade fastball reached 100 mph as late as the fourth inning and his curveball was particularly sharp. The uptick in velocity is something Norton has seen more of this season. His fastball sat typically in the mid-90s last year. \n",
      " \"He came to us with that [velocity],\" the pitching coach said. \"Like a lot of guys, it fluctuates over two to three years. \n",
      " \"I think his arm just feels better this year, and you're starting to see him sit at 97, 98 in some starts.\" \n",
      " Abreu's health also has improved. He had three separate stints on the injured list in 2018, when all but one of his non-rehab starts were with Class A Advanced Tampa. Certain pitchers, Norton said, pitch differently when their arm feels better. \n",
      " \"It might be for a few months, it might be for a year,\" he said. \"I think that's just kind of the life of a pitcher, where it just doesn't feel 100 percent for a pitcher. He's coming out of the gates every game getting after it, and it's coming out hot. I'm sure it feels a little better, overall.\" \n",

      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The Minnesota Twins are a hit — and getting hit. \n",
      " Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and the Twins beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-3 Friday night in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game lead in the AL Central. \n",
      " \"We don't want our guys getting nicked up or anything, but sometimes you take the baserunners any way you can,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"And sometimes it takes a base hit with men on base to kind of wake everyone up and get things going.\" \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",
      " \"It's something we've seen this year. In the games that we have not played our best or lost, we've come back the day after and really pulled together and played good baseball,\" Baldelli said. \"It's what we've come to expect. I think we have the type of guys that regardless of what happens today, they'll be ready to play tomorrow.\" \n",
      " Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " The Twins have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. They trailed 3-1 in the fifth before Polanco drove in a run with his second double and scored on a single by Willians Astudillo. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout. Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo plunked Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " Kolarek, a left-hander, relieved to face the left-handed hitting Rosario, and Rosario grounded an opposite-field single to left, past the spot vacated when third baseman Christian Arroyo shifted toward shortstop. \n",
      " Rogers (2-1) retired his first six batters, allowed Daniel Robertson's two-out single in the ninth, then retired Mike Zunino on a groundout. \n",
      " Berríos struck out eight in 6 2/3 innings, allowing three runs and three hits. \n",
      " Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. \n",
      " Astudillo had an RBI single in the first, but Kevin Kiermaier's two-run homer in the second put the Rays ahead. Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",
      " Astudillo was thrown out at the plate by Kiermaier while trying to score on C.J. Cron's two-out double to center. \n",
      " SCARY \n",
      " Rays pitcher Emilio Pagán was hit on the right cheek by a line drive off Schoop's bat in the sixth but remained in the game. \n",
      " \"I was lucky,\" Pagan said. \"Probably my No. 1 fear, most pitchers will agree, that a ball coming back at you is not a fun situation to be in. It could have gotten me on my hand a lot more serious, and it definitely could have hit me in the face a lot harder.\" \n",

      " Derek Fisher hit a tiebreaking homer to lead off the eighth inning for his first long ball of the season and the short-handed Houston Astros rallied to beat the Athletics. \n",
      " The Astros trailed the A's 2-0 heading into the seventh inning on a night they were missing injured stars Jose Altuvé, Carlos Correa and George Springer. But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A's their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. \n",
      " Héctor Rondón (3-1) pitched out of a jam in the seventh with help from a diving stop at shortstop by defensive replacement Jack Mayfield that held Ramón Laureano at third base with the infield drawn in. Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. \n",
      " Houston's Josh Reddick snapped an 0-for-15 rut with a solo homer. \n",
      " White Sox 2, Indians 1 \n",
      " Dylan Covey pitched six effective innings for his first win since August, and the White Sox beat sloppy Cleveland for their season-high fifth straight win. \n",
      " Charlie Tilson hit a two-run double to get Chicago's offense rolling. Tilson, Yoán Moncada, Yonder Alonso and Yolmer Sánchez each had two hits. The win moved the White Sox into a second-place tie in the AL Central with Cleveland. \n",
      " The Indians committed four errors. Four of Chicago's six runs against slumping Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer were unearned. \n",
      " Covey (1-4) settled down after allowing a leadoff homer to Francisco Lindor and scattered eight hits and ended a personal six-game losing streak. Josh Osich and Juan Minaya followed with three innings of one-hit relief. \n",
      " Bauer (4-5) allowed nine hits and struck out eight in seven innings, but shaky fielding doomed the right-hander. \n",
      " Rangers 6, Royals 2 \n",
      " Joey Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth-inning outburst as the Rangers rallied past the Kansas City Royals. \n",
      " Gallo's home run, his team leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. He allowed two runs on five hits and three walks and had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks — both in the sixth. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Adalberto Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base, giving the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",
      " Mariners 4, Angels 3 \n",
      " Jay Bruce hit his 300th career home run, Tom Murphy had a two-run shot and an RBI double, and the Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels. \n",
      " Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles, achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a dental procedure) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. \n",
      " The win snapped the Angels' three-game winning streak and wasted a fairly strong start by the Angels' Tyler Skaggs (4-5), who gave up just five hits but made a handful of costly mistakes while giving up four runs in seven innings. \n",
      " The Angels briefly got to Mike Leake (4-6) in the sixth inning when Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani hit back-to-back home runs to left field with two outs. It was the first time Los Angeles has hit consecutive home runs this season, but it wasn't enough for the Angels. \n",
      " National League \n",
      " Dodgers 6, Phillies 3 \n",
      " Max Muncy, Joc Pederson, Corey Seager and Enriquè Hernàndez homered, powering Los Angeles past Philadelphia in the opener of a series matching the National League's best teams. \n",
      " The West-leading Dodgers improved to a major league-best 23-7 at home and have won 11 of their last 15 at Chavez Ravine against the East-leading Phillies. The Dodgers' 39 victories lead the NL. Los Angeles rapped out 12 hits while limiting the Phillies to five, including two in the ninth. \n",
      " Kenta Maeda (7-2) allowed two runs and three hits in six innings and won his fourth straight start. He struck out six and walked none. Kenley Jansen earned his 17th save. \n",
      " Muncy and Seager belted two-run shots and Pederson had a solo homer off Jake Arrieta (5-5), who gave up five runs and 10 hits in five innings, striking out three and walking one. \n",
      " Philadelphia's Bryce Harper, Andrew McCutchen and Rhys Hoskins combined to go 2 for 12. McCutchen homered to lead off the fourth. \n",
      " Cardinals 2, Cubs 1 (10) \n",
      " Matt Carpenter hit a game-ending single against an unusual defensive alignment in the 10th to lead the Cardinals past the Chicago Cubs. \n",
      " The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage for May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). They went 8-18 in May 1980. \n",
      " Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter and put four players on the right side of the infield. But Carpenter drove in Wong with a fly ball that found the grass in the left field corner. \n",
      " Carlos Martínez pitched a perfect eighth for St. Louis, and Jordan Hicks (2-2) worked two scoreless innings. The last pitch Hicks threw in the ninth registered at 104.3 mph, which is the fastest in baseball this season. \n",
      " Pirates 9, Brewers 4 \n",
      " Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",
      " Reds 9, Nationals 3 \n",
      " Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",
      " Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto's 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. \n",
      " Cincinnati's Joey Votto returned after missing three games with a tight right hamstring and had three hits. Eugenio Suarez was back in the lineup after getting hit on the left hand by Clay Holmes' pitch on Wednesday. \n",
      " Padres 5, Marlins 2 \n",
      " Franmil Reyes, Hunter Renfroe and Ian Kinsler homered, and left-hander Joey Lucchesi combined with two relievers on a four-hitter for his first victory in six starts to lead the Padres past the Miami Marlins. \n",
      " Lucchesi (4-3) hadn't won since beating Cincinnati at home on April 21. He retired his first seven batters before allowing a double by Miguel Rojas in the third. He then retired eight straight before allowing a home run by pinch-hitter Rosell Herrera with one out in the sixth. Lucchesi struck out five and walked one. \n",
      " Craig Stammen pitched 1 2/3 hitless innings, Phil Maton allowed two singles to open the Marlins' ninth and Kirby Yates came on to get the final three outs for his 22nd save, best in the majors. \n",
      " Herrera was pinch-hitting for lefty Caleb Smith (3-3), who lost his third straight decision after allowing two runs and three hits in five innings. \n",
      " Interleague \n",
      " Rockies 13, Blue Jays 6 \n",
      " Trevor Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and Colorado beat slumping Toronto for its sixth straight win. \n",
      " It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. \n",
      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",
      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. \n",
      " Orioles 9, Giants 5 \n",
      " Dwight Smith's first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Núñez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home as the teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. Núñez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " Richard Bleier got five outs for his second save. \n",
      " Tigers 8, Braves 2 \n",
      " Niko Goodrum homered twice and had a career-high five hits, Nicholas Castellanos and Grayson Greiner also went deep, and the Detroit Tigers romped past the Braves. \n",
      " Spencer Turnbull (3-4) pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just five hits and one earned run in dealing the Braves their third straight loss at SunTrust Park. \n",
      " Goodrum, who came into the night hitting just .208, launched a 419-foot drive that nearly went into the Chop House restaurant above the right-field seats in the third inning. He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",
      " After two straight strong starts, Atlanta's Mike Foltynewicz (1-4) had another rough night. Foltynewicz surrendered seven hits and five runs in five innings. \n",

      " ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Joey Gallo hit a tie-breaking home run for the second straight game before leaving in the fifth inning due to injury as the Texas Rangers beat the Kansas City Royals 6-2 Saturday. \n",
      " Gallo was removed because of tightness in his left oblique while batting. He initially felt the injury while in the outfield and then again on a check swing during a plate appearance. He will undergo treatment and further evaluation. \n",
      " Lance Lynn (7-4) allowed both runs. He yielded six hits and a hit batter, striking out seven for his fifth straight quality start. \n",
      " The Rangers have won four of five, improved to 19-9 at home and moved two games over .500 at 29-27. \n",
      " Gallo broke a scoreless tie in the fourth inning, hitting a 1-0 pitch from Homer Bailey (4-6) over the home bullpen in right-center for his 17th homer of the season, good enough for a tie with four others for the American League lead. On Friday night, Gallo hit a grand slam in the sixth inning in a 6-2 win over the Royals. \n",
      " Bailey gave up four runs on six hits and two walks in 3 2/3 innings for his fourth straight start without a victory. He allowed only a first-inning single to Nomar Mazara before Hunter Pence led off the fourth with an opposite-field ground single to right ahead of Gallo's homer. \n",
      " The Royals have lost five of their last six games and have the worst road record in the majors at 8-22. Kansas City left seven runners on base and was 2 for 11 with runners in scoring position. \n",
      " Martin Maldonado and Cam Gallagher, who replaced Maldonado behind the plate in the sixth inning, had RBI doubles. Maldonado was pulled as a precaution with right forearm tightness. \n",
      " Pence and Kansas City's Whit Merrifield each had two hits for the second straight game. \n",
      " SHORT HOPS \n",
      " Rangers C Jeff Mathis had a sacrifice fly for his third RBI of the season in 31 games, his first since April 24. ... Five of Texas' six hits off Bailey were by left-handed hitters. The 33-year-old right-hander entered the game holding left-handed batters to a .213 batting average. ... Merrifield has hits in 10 of his last 11 games. ... Maldonado has a .327 career batting average at Globe Life Park. ... Texas placed RHP Jeanmar Gómez on unconditional release waivers after designating him for assignment last Sunday. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Royals: 3B Hunter Dozier (right thorax tightness), who left Thursday's series opener in the fifth inning, probably won't return before Tuesday. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Royals: RHP Brad Keller (3-6, 4.56) leads the AL with 42 walks. Keller allowed only one last time out — but also 10 hits — in giving up four runs in six innings in a loss to the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday. \n",
      " Rangers: RHP Adrian Sampson (3-3, 4.53) has won his last three outings, each following an opener. Sampson will make his first true start since May 12 and sixth of the season. \n",

      " LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Matt Lloyd hit a three-run homer in the sixth inning, Cole Barr and Drew Ashley each added solo homers and Indiana avoided elimination from the NCAA Louisville Regional with a 9-5 victory over Illinois-Chicago on Saturday. \n",
      " A day after striking out 18 times in an 8-7 loss to Illinois State, the second-seeded Hoosiers (37-22) rebounded with four of their eight hits for extra bases. Lloyd's blast to right field made it 7-3 before Cole Barr and Drew Ashley each homered over the next two innings. \n",
      " Gabe Bierman (4-0) allowed just two hits and two walks and struck out two over 3 2/3 innings of relief for the victory. Tommy Sommer gave up one hit over the final 1 2/3 innings for his first save as Indiana ended a three-game postseason losing streak. The Hoosiers will face the Louisville-Illinois State loser on Sunday. \n",
      " Scott Ota's two-run homer in the bottom of the first gave No. 3 UIC (29-23) its only lead, though the Flames tied it at 3 on Joshua Figueroa's RBI double in the third. \n",

      " By The Associated Press \n",
      " May 31, 2019 \n",
      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — The Minnesota Twins are a hit — and getting hit. \n",
      " Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and the Twins beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-3 Friday night in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game lead in the AL Central. \n",
      " \"We don't want our guys getting nicked up or anything, but sometimes you take the baserunners any way you can,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"And sometimes it takes a base hit with men on base to kind of wake everyone up and get things going.\" \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",
      " \"It's something we've seen this year. In the games that we have not played our best or lost, we've come back the day after and really pulled together and played good baseball,\" Baldelli said. \"It's what we've come to expect. I think we have the type of guys that regardless of what happens today, they'll be ready to play tomorrow.\" \n",
      " Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " The Twins have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. They trailed 3-1 in the fifth before Polanco drove in a run with his second double and scored on a single by Willians Astudillo. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout. Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo plunked Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " Kolarek, a left-hander, relieved to face the left-handed hitting Rosario, and Rosario grounded an opposite-field single to left, past the spot vacated when third baseman Christian Arroyo shifted toward shortstop. \n",
      " Rogers (2-1) retired his first six batters, allowed Daniel Robertson's two-out single in the ninth, then retired Mike Zunino on a groundout. \n",
      " Berríos struck out eight in 6 2/3 innings, allowing three runs and three hits. \n",
      " Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. \n",
      " Astudillo had an RBI single in the first, but Kevin Kiermaier's two-run homer in the second put the Rays ahead. Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",
      " Astudillo was thrown out at the plate by Kiermaier while trying to score on C.J. Cron's two-out double to center. \n",
      " SCARY \n",
      " Rays pitcher Emilio Pagán was hit on the right cheek by a line drive off Schoop's bat in the sixth but remained in he game. \n",
      " \"I was lucky,\" Pagan said. \"Probably my No. 1 fear, most pitchers will agree, that a ball coming back at you is not a fun situation to be in. It could have gotten me on my hand a lot more serious, and it definitely could have hit me in the face a lot harder.\" \n",
      " SHORT BENCH \n",
      " Tampa Bay played with C Travis d'Arnaud as the only healthy backup. Outfielders Tommy Pham (right leg cramp) and Avisail Garcia (overall body soreness/hamstrings) were limited to pinch hitting. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Twins: Polanco was at DH after missing Thursday's game due to illness. \n",
      " Rays: C Zunino (strained left quadriceps) was reinstated from the 10-day IL and C Erik Kratz was designated for assignment. ... INF Yandy Díaz (bruised left hand) was sent to extended spring training. ... INF Matt Duffy, out all season with a strained left hamstring, said a specialist he saw this week found no structural damage. Duffy could resume jogging Monday. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " RHP Kyle Gibson (5-2, 4.08) is to start Saturday for the Twins and RHP Yonny Chirinos (6-1. 2.91) for the Rays. \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids - Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",
      " - Oregon State's Adley Rutschman, batting .420 and the likely No. 1 pick in next week's Major League Baseball draft, was intentionally walked with the bases loaded to pull the Beavers within 5-3 in the seventh inning. \n",
      " - Dallas Baptist knocked out Florida starter Tommy Mace after 1 1/3 innings and collected 17 hits against four pitchers in an 11-8 win. \n",
      " - Aaron Schunk hit two of Georgia's three home runs and had five RBIs in a 13-3 win over Mercer. \n",
      " - Florida State's Mike Salvatore had four of his team's 20 hits and Drew Mendoza joined Becker in homering twice against FAU. \n",
      " - Auburn 8-hole hitter Steven Williams had four hits, including a three-run homer, and five RBIs against Coastal Carolina. \n",
      " - Tristin English went 4 for 4 with five RBIs to lead Georgia Tech past Florida A&M 13-2. \n",
      " MOUND MARVELS \n",
      " - Vanderbilt's Drake Fellows earned his nation-leading 12th win, scattering seven hits and striking out nine in an 8-2 win over Ohio State. \n",
      " - Brendan Beck and Cody Jensen combined on a four-hitter in Stanford's 11-0 win over Sacramento State. \n",
      " - Codie Paiva and Nick Frasso combined on a four-hitter in Loyola Marymount's 3-1 win over Baylor. \n",
      " - Micah Dallas limited Army to three hits and a run in seven innings in Texas Tech's 11-2 win. \n",
      " - Clemson's Davis Sharpe pitched the final 6 2/3 innings against Illinois in his first career relief appearance. \n",
      " - Illinois State starter Brent Headrick struck out 14 in six innings against Indiana. \n",

      " The second day of NCAA regionals brought an early exit for the defending national champion, one of the greatest individual performances in tournament history and an upset of No. 1 national seed UCLA. \n",
      " Oregon State was eliminated on its home field with a 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton on Saturday, marking the first time the Beavers have gone 0-2 in regionals in 14 appearances since 1985. They were knocked out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",
      " \"It was a matter of us not playing good baseball. That's the bottom line,\" OSU interim coach Pat Bailey said. \n",
      " The Beavers lost 10 of their last 15 games and finished 36-20-1 a season after they completed a two-year run in which they won 111 of 130 games under former coach Pat Casey. \n",
      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman's last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " Baylor's Shea Langeliers hit three home runs and doubled while going 5 for 6 and driving in a tournament-record 11 runs in a 24-6 win over Omaha in an elimination game. \n",
      " \"When I was a little kid, I liked to think I was a pretty good hitter, but I think this game will probably be one of the most meaningful games for me as a hitter probably for the rest of my career,\" Langeliers said. \"Our backs were up against the wall and we needed a big game from our offense and we got it. It was a lot of fun.\" \n",
      " Langeliers, who likely will be the second catcher drafted behind Rutschman, broke the NCAA postseason record of 10 RBIs in a game shared by Vanderbilt's Connor Kaiser (2018) and Miami's Kevin Brown (2001). \n",
      " Langeliers' homers were for two, one and three runs. He also had a two-run single and three-run double. \n",

      " From CCU reports \n",
      " Save \n",
      " ATLANTA, Ga. – Coastal Carolina baseball saw a 2-2 tie disappear in the fourth inning as the Auburn Tigers scored 14 runs over its last five at-bats to pull away with a 16-7 win over the Chanticleers in the first game of the 2019 NCAA Atlanta Regional on Friday afternoon at Russ Chandler Stadium. \n",
      " The loss snaps Coastal's (35-25-1) winning streak at five-straight games and puts the Chants one game away from elimination. Auburn (34-25) will now be in the winner's bracket with the win. \n",
      " The CCU offense got two hits from shortstop Scott McKeon (2-for-5, RBI) while eight other Chants had one hit apiece in the loss. Sophomore Parker Chavers (1-for-5, HR, RBI, run) and senior Zach Biermann (1-for-4, HR, 3 RBI, run) each had a home run and combined to drive in four RBI for the game. \n",
      " Auburn's offensive breakout was led by sophomore outfielder Steven Williams (4-for-5, HR, 5 RBI, 2 runs) as he drove in a game-high five RBI in the win, while the top of the order in Judd Ward (3-for-5, BB, RBI, 2 runs) and Ryan Bliss (3-for-5, BB, 3 RBI, 2 runs) combined to go 6-for-10 with four RBI and four runs scored. \n",
      " Coastal starter Anthony Veneziano (5-3) suffered the loss, as the left-handed junior hurler gave up six runs on seven hits, two walks and five strikeouts over four complete innings. \n",
      " The Chants' offense drove Auburn starter Jack Owen out of the game after just 3 2/3 innings; however, the win went to the Tigers' Elliott Anderson (6-2) as he gave up three runs on one hit, two walks and four strikeouts over 2 2/3 innings out of the bullpen. \n",
      " Auburn got on the scoreboard first, as the Tigers led off the bottom of the first inning with back-to-back singles. After a strikeout and a fly ball moved the lead runner up to third, a called balk allowed the Tigers' Ward to score from third and put the first run up in the game. \n",
      " A wild pitch followed by a Matt Scheffler line drive into left field for an RBI single extended the Tigers' lead out to 2-0 after just one inning of play. \n",
      " The Chants got one run back in the top of the third, as Cory Wood led off the inning with a double, advanced to third on a ground out and then eventually scored on a wild pitch to cut the Auburn lead in half at 2-1 midway through the third. \n",
      " Chavers, an Alabama native, tied the game up in the top of the fourth inning with one swing of the bat with a solo home run to right-center field to put the score at 2-2. It was Chaver's 14th home run on the year. \n",
      " However, the Tigers retook the lead in the bottom half of the inning on a Rankin Woley RBI single and a three-run home run to right field from Williams to give the home team a 6-2 lead heading into the fifth inning. \n",
      " Auburn added to its lead with back-to-back RBI singles in the bottom of the fifth to push its lead out to six at 8-2 with four innings to play. \n",
      " More Sports \n",
      " After an Auburn solo home run by Conor Davis in the bottom of the sixth put the Tigers up 9-2, Biermann hit a three-run home run to right-center field that took the Auburn outfielder's glove with it to put the Chants within four at 9-5. The home run was his team-leading 18th dinger of the season. \n",
      " Yet the Chants couldn't get a shutdown inning, as Auburn plated two in the bottom of the seventh on three hits, including a Bliss two-run single to pull back out in front at 11-5. \n",

      " Kole Calhoun beats the odds, homers against a left-hander to lift Angels \n",
      " Jun 01, 2019 | 9:20 PM \n",
      " | SEATTLE \n",
      " Angels' Kole Calhoun is congratulated by third base coach Mike Gallego after hitting a go-ahead two-run home off Seattle Mariners' Roenis Elias during the eighth inning on Saturday in Seattle. (John Froschauer / Associated Press) \n",
      " This was not the kind of matchup that has generally favored the Angels this season. \n",
      " First, they faced a left-hander on the mound. The Angels entered Saturday with a .228 average, ranked 26th in the major leagues, and a .703 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, ranked 22nd, against left-handers. \n",
      " Advertisement \n",
      " Then, at the plate stood Kole Calhoun, a left-handed batter who was hitting .180 against left-handers this season and was two for 11 with two strikeouts and two walks lifetime against Seattle Mariners reliever Roenis Elias. \n",
      " With one vicious swing at a full-count pitch, Calhoun stuffed those odds in a shredder. The Angels right fielder drove an up-and-away 94-mph fastball over the wall in right-center field for a tie-breaking two-run home run in the eighth inning of a 6-3 victory before 28,128 in T-Mobile Park. \n",
      " By Mike DiGiovanna \n",
      " Jun 01, 2019 | 7:25 PM \n",
      " “I’ve had some at-bats off him, and I guess that helps,” Calhoun said after the Angels won for the sixth time in eight games. “I’ve seen him before, and I know what he’s got. I battled back and forth, laid off some good pitches. I got a good pitch to hit and put a good swing on it.” \n",
      " The score was tied 3-3 when Cesar Puello led off the eighth with an infield single and Tommy La Stella singled to right. Up stepped catcher Jonathan Lucroy, who was hitless in three at-bats but has dropped all of seven sacrifice bunts in 10 big-league seasons. \n",
      " “It crossed my mind,” Angels manager Brad Ausmus said of bunting Lucroy, “but he hasn’t bunted much in his life. That’s usually a recipe for disaster.” \n",
      " Lucroy grounded into a double play before Calhoun, who hit .299 with a .946 OPS in May after hitting .194 with a .716 OPS in March and April, came through. \n",
      " Mike Trout added a solo homer in the ninth for a 6-3 lead, his team-leading 14th of the season and 22nd in T-Mobile Park, the most by a visiting player in stadium history. Cam Bedrosian, Ty Buttrey and Hansel Robles each threw an inning of scoreless relief behind Andrew Heaney, who delivered a second strong start after missing the first two months of the season because of elbow inflammation. \n",
      " Sign up for our daily sports newsletter » \n",
      " Heaney allowed three runs and five hits in six innings, striking out 10—eight with his curveball—and walking none. The left-hander got swinging strikes on 22 of the 92 pitches he threw, 15 on his 36 breaking balls and seven on his 53 sinking fastballs. \n",
      " But Heaney made at least two glaring mistakes that were crushed by Edwin Encarnacion, who drove a 1-and-0 changeup 400 feet over the left-field wall for a solo homer in the fourth and a full-count curve 438 feet to center for a two-run shot in the sixth that tied the score 3-3. \n",
      " The Angels scored twice in the first when David Fletcher walked and Albert Pujols hit a towering two-run homer to left, his 10th this season. \n",
      " “Going down 1-and-0 and throwing a fastball to him is probably not a good idea,” Seattle starter Tommy Milone said. \n",
      " The Angels pushed the lead to 3-0 in the third when Fletcher doubled to left, Pujols was intentionally walked with two out and Puello hit an RBI double to left. \n",
      " “Getting a win—that’s all that matters,” said Heaney, who used the words “kind of mediocre” to describe his first two starts, in which he’s allowed five runs and 10 hits—four of them homers—struck out 18 and walked one in 11 innings. \n",
      " “They spotted me some early runs and I kind of let them creep back into it. Not what I was trying to do, obviously. But that swing that Kole put on it … that was awesome. That was the fatal blow, so that was good.” \n",

      " Oregon State was eliminated on its home field with a 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton on Saturday, marking the first time the Beavers have gone 0-2 in regionals in 14 appearances since 1985. They were knocked out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",

      " BALTIMORE \n",
      " Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the center field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.'s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " \"I feel like every time he is around I do something,\" the younger Smith said. \"He's a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.\" \n",

      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " \"It's been a rough couple of months,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We've had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.\" \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " \"A great day by the kid,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.\" \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz's ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn't allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " \"It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,\" Cashner said. \"I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.\" \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles' bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year's Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. \"Nothing's really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,\" Elias said. ... The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Orioles: OF Mark Trumbo (knee surgery) had his third rehab assignment for Double-A Bowie. He went 2 for 4 with a strikeout and run. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Giants: Shaun Anderson (0-1, 4.80 ERA) will make his fourth major-league start. He allowed six runs (four earned) and nine hits over five innings in his last outing May 26 against Arizona. \n",
      " Orioles: David Hess (1-6, 6.71 ERA) has not won since carrying a no-hitter into the seventh inning April 1 against Toronto. He has given up a league-leading 18 homers over 11 appearances. \n",

      " The second day of NCAA regionals brought an early exit for the defending national champion, one of the greatest individual performances in tournament history and an upset that put upstart Illinois State a win away from its first super regional. \n",
      " Oregon State was eliminated on its home field with a 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton, marking the first time the Beavers have gone 0-2 in regionals in 14 appearances since 1985. They were knocked out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",
      " \"It was a matter of us not playing good baseball. That's the bottom line,\" OSU interim coach Pat Bailey said. \n",
      " The Beavers lost 10 of their last 15 games and finished 36-20-1 a season after they completed a two-year run in which it won 111 of 130 games under former coach Pat Casey. \n",
      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman's last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " In Los Angeles, Baylor's Shea Langeliers hit three home runs and doubled while going 5 for 6 and driving in a tournament-record 11 runs in a 24-6 win over Omaha in an elimination game. \n",
      " \"When I was a little kid, I liked to think I was a pretty good hitter, but I think this game will probably be one of the most meaningful games for me as a hitter probably for the rest of my career,\" Langeliers said. \"Our backs were up against the wall and we needed a big game from our offense and we got it.

      " The Redbirds (36-24) continued their surge under first-year coach Steve Holm, who took over a team that went 22-30 a year ago and led them to a share of the Missouri Valley Conference title. \n",
      " Other national seeds that lost and face elimination Sunday: No. 3 Georgia Tech, No. 4 Georgia, No. 10 East Carolina and No. 15 West Virginia. \n",

      " BATON ROUGE, La. (WDAM) - A fly ball that became a home run by the width of outfield wall padding and a handrail set off Friday afternoon one of the more remarkable offensive displays in University of Southern Mississippi baseball history. \n",
      " Shortstop Storme Cooper led off the top of the fifth inning with his first home run of the season and fourth of his career, not only tying the game but setting off a 12-run scoring spree as the Golden Eagles went on to bury Arizona State University 15-3 at Alex Box Stadium in the opening game of the Baton Rouge (La.) Regional. \n",
      " Third-seeded USM (39-19) will meet host and top-seeded Louisiana State University (38-24) at 6 p.m. Saturday. The Tigers won Friday’s nightcap 17-3 over Stony Brook University. \n",
      " Second seeded ASU (37-18) will face fourth-seeded Stony Brook (31-22) in an elimination game at noon Saturday. \n",
      " Cooper, who had just seven hits during the regular season, was one of three Golden Eagles with two hits in an inning that saw USM send 15 batters to the plate, mash nine hits, knock ASU ace Alec Marsh from the game and open NCAA Regional play with a victory for the fourth consecutive year. \n",
      " “Pleased the way our guys showed up on a hot day to go out and compete,” USM coach Scott Berry said. “if you look at the body of work, you can’t help but notice the 12 runs that were scored in the fifth inning. \n",
      " “Before that, in the third, we missed an opportunity with runners at first and second and nobody out and the top of the order up and we did not get any runs. But (starting pitcher) Gabe Shepard went back out did what he had to do to keep the momentum with us. Very proud of his outing (Friday).” \n",
      " Shepard, who tossed 7 1/3 innings of no-hit ball in his last outing in the semifinal round of the 2019 Conference USA baseball tourney, shut down one of the country’s top offenses on two runs and six hits over 5 2/3 innings. \n",
      " He struck out four and walked three. \n",
      " “I had a ton of confidence going out there, just they believed in me and trusted me to go out there and get the job done. \n",
      " “I feel like my teammates have confidence in me, and that makes me feel good, going out there and knowing they have my back.” \n",
      " Shephard (3-0) allowed a run for the first time in three starts, when Arizona State center fielder Hunter Bishop singled to lead off the bottom of the fourth inning, moved to second on an infield dribbler, went to third base on a wild pitch and scored on catcher Lyle Lin’s sacrifice fly. \n",
      " But after USM had managed just three hits over the first four innings, Cooper led off the fifth by turning a 3-2 offering from Marsh (9-4) into a fly ball to left field that just cleared the top of the wall, bouncing off the backside of the railing and into the first rows of the bleachers. \n",
      " “It’s been a while,” said Cooper, whose last home run came against Old Dominion University in 2017. “I felt like we were playing with a lot of emotion, and I got the guys fired up.” \n",
      " That hit indeed seemed to open the floodgates, as the baseball gods donned black-and-gold for the next 20 minutes or so. \n",
      " Montenegro ripped a first-pitch double into the left-center field gap before Matt Guidry smoked a line drive into the glove of Spencer Torkelson at first base for the inning’s first out. \n",
      " Hunter Slater coaxed a walk off Marsh and Matt Wallner lined a single off the wall past diving right fielder Carter Aldrete to score Montenegro for a 2-1 USM lead. \n",
      " After a strikeout for the second out, Marsh uncorked a pair of wild pitches. The first scored Slater for a 3-1 USM lead and sent Wallner to second. The second put Wallner on third. \n",
      " Cole Donaldson walked and Fred Franklin followed with a seeing-eye single into right field for a 4-1 lead. \n",
      " That ended Marsh’s day and brought in reliever Blake Burzell, who did not retire any of the four batters he faced. \n",
      " Danny Lynch greeted him with a flyball that plopped just inside the foul line for a double that scored Donaldson for a 5-1 lead. \n",
      " Cooper then hustled down the line to beat out an infield single that scored both Donaldson and Lynch for a 7-1 lead. \n",
      " Montenegro was generously credited with a single into the hole, ending Burzell’s day and bringing in Erik Tolman, who promptly walked Guidry to load the bases. \n",
      " Slater slipped a single into right field, scoring Cooper and Montenegro for a 9-1 bulge and Wallner followed with his 22nd home run of the season, a three-run blast that nearly cleared the outfield bleachers in right-center field. \n",
      " That capped the largest inning in USM baseball annals since the Golden Eagles scored 13 runs in the fifth inning against the University of Houston on March 24, 2012. \n",
      " “What did they get? Ten runs with two outs?” asked Arizona State Tracy Smith. “One ball hits the line, one beats the shift, the others creep through. It’s just one of those innings. I don’t know if you have a description for it, other than they put balls in play (Friday) and found holes. \n",
      " “We weren’t kicking it around. Outside maybe a walk, we weren’t really giving it to them. Give credit to them. They put the bat on the ball and found the space. Sometimes that happens and you just can’t shut it off.” \n",
      " Indeed. Lynch added his own three-run homer in the eighth inning, and USM logged five hits over the final four innings. All told, USM racked up 17 hits and scored the fourth-most runs by a USM team in a regional game and the most sine a 19-6 win over Jacksonville State in the 2010 Auburn Regional. \n",
      " “It helps when you get into a rhythm as an offense,” said Wallner, who is a home run shy of tying USM’s single-season record shared by four others. “That is how we were in the fifth inning. It made it easy just to go up to the plate and have a solid approach.” \n",
      " Spotted an 11-run lead, Guidry worked a 1-2-3 fifth inning, but then couldn’t get out of the bottom of the sixth. \n",
      " Torkelson led off the inning with his 22nd homer of the year, and, eventually, the Sun Devils had runners on first and second with two outs and Guidry at a 2-0 count and 112 pitches. \n",
      " Guidry was relieved by Sean Tweedy, who finished the walk to Aldrete to load the bases, but then struck out Cole Austin to end the inning. \n",
      " J.C. Keys worked two scoreless, walking one on the seventh inning only to roll a double-play grounder. He then struck the next four men he faced over the seventh and eighth innings. \n",
      " ASU added a run in the ninth inning off Mason Strickland on a pinch-hit single by Nick Cheema. \n",
      " Cooper and Lynch each had three hits for the Golden Eagles. Cooper drove in a season-high three runs and scored twice, while Lynch drove in four runs and scored twice. \n",
      " Wallner, Franklin, Montenegro and Slater had two hits apiece, while Montenegro, Slater, Wallner and Cole Donaldson scored two runs each. \n",
      " The Sun Devils finished with eight hits, with third baseman Gage Workman coming up with two singles. \n",
      " Freshman Danny Lynch tacked on three runs with a two-out, three-run home run in the top of the eighth to give Southern Miss a 15-2 lead. \n",
      " Keys returned to the mound in the eighth inning and struck out the side. Mason Strickland came on for Southern Miss to close out the ninth inning, allowing one run before ending the game on a double play. \n",
      " Cooper finished the day with three hits and four RBI, while Wallner contributed two hits and four RBI. Lynch finished with three hits and four RBI. \n",

      " BALTIMORE (AP) — Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the center field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.'s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " \"I feel like every time he is around I do something,\" the younger Smith said. \"He's a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.\" \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " \"It's been a rough couple of months,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We've had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.\" \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " \"A great day by the kid,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.\" \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz's ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn't allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " \"It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,\" Cashner said. \"I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.\" \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles' bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year's Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. \"Nothing's really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,\" Elias said. ... The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Orioles: OF Mark Trumbo (knee surgery) had his third rehab assignment for Double-A Bowie. He went 2 for 4 with a strikeout and run. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Giants: Shaun Anderson (0-1, 4.80 ERA) will make his fourth major-league start. He allowed six runs (four earned) and nine hits over five innings in his last outing May 26 against Arizona. \n",
      " Orioles: David Hess (1-6, 6.71 ERA) has not won since carrying a no-hitter into the seventh inning April 1 against Toronto. He has given up a league-leading 18 homers over 11 appearances. \n",

      " The Beavers' 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton, which followed a 7-6 loss to American Athletic Conference champ Cincinnati on Friday, knocked them out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",
      " Baylor's Shea Langeliers turned in one of the greatest individual postseason performances, hitting three home runs and doubling while going 5 for 6 and driving in a tournament-record 11 runs in the Bears' 24-6 win over Omaha in an elimination game. \n",

      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman's last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " Illinois State continued its surge under first-year coach Steve Holm, who took over a Redbirds team that went 22-30 a year ago and led them to a share of the Missouri Valley Conference title. \n",

      " ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Joey Gallo stood in center field trying not to beat himself up after misplaying two fly balls into triples as he and the Texas Rangers trailed the Kansas City Royals by two runs going into the sixth inning. \n",
      " Soon enough, Gallo took out his frustrations on the baseball. \n",
      " Gallo ’s first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth inning outburst as the Rangers rallied past the Royals 6-2 Friday night. \n",
      " The Rangers have won five of their last six home games while the Royals have lost of four of their last five overall. \n",
      " Gallo ’s home run, his team-leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet and landed in the second seating area beyond the center-field wall. \n",
      " “Things turned around quick,” Gallo said. In his first season playing regularly in center, he also redeemed himself defensively by finishing the game with a diving catch in left-center on a ball hit by Billy Hamilton. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. Jurado allowed two runs on five hits and three walks. The second-year right-hander, who was recalled from Triple-A Nashville on April 26, had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " All of that on a night when his parents, Ariel Sr. and Yizel, had traveled from Panama to see him pitch in the majors for the first time. \n",
      " “That was something special,” Jurado said through an interpreter. \n",
      " With Jurado outpitched by veteran Royals left-hander Danny Duffy through five innings, Rangers manager Chris Woodward thought his youngster deserved a better fate given the circumstances. \n",
      " “I’m saying a little prayer ‘cause the baseball gods should be with us on this one,” Woodward said. “Like, I was hoping for three (runs).” \n",
      " Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26, his first start of the season after recovering from last year’s shoulder injury. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, he allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks - both in the sixth. \n",
      " “This game will rip your heart out sometimes,” Duffy said. “But I’ve got to turn the page after tonight and go back out there, try to be better next time.” \n",
      " Texas loaded the bases in the sixth inning on outfield singles by Shin-Soo Choo and Elvis Andrus and a chopper hit between third base and the mound by Hunter Pence. Duffy fielded Pence’s grounder, but his throw to first base was late. \n",
      " Duffy walked Nomar Mazara with the bases loaded to tie the score 2-2. Gallo then launched a 1-1 fastball to end a six-game homerless streak, which matched his longest this season. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City’s other run. Cuthbert, who earlier Friday had his contract selected from Triple-A Omaha, hit an opposite-field homer that just cleared the right-field wall in the second and also made a standout play at third base. \n",
      " “He’s always been a really good defender at third base for us,” Royals manager Ned Yost said of Cuthbert. “That’s kind of expected.” \n",
      " Gordon’s triple in the fifth inning turned around Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway center, scoring Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. \n",
      " All of that was forgotten in the bottom of the sixth. \n",
      " SHORT HOPS \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. … The Royals lead the majors with 24 triples. … Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base to give the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",

      " Matt Lloyd hit a three-run homer in the sixth inning, Cole Barr and Drew Ashley each added solo homers and Indiana avoided elimination from the NCAA Louisville Regional with a 9-5 victory over Illinois-Chicago on Saturday. \n",
      " A day after striking out 18 times in an 8-7 loss to Illinois State, the second-seeded Hoosiers (37-22) rebounded with four of their eight hits for extra bases. Lloyd's blast to right field made it 7-3 before Cole Barr and Drew Ashley each homered over the next two innings. \n",
      " Gabe Bierman (4-0) allowed just two hits and two walks and struck out two over 3 2/3 innings of relief for the victory. Tommy Sommer gave up one hit over the final 1 2/3 innings for his first save as Indiana ended a three-game postseason losing streak. The Hoosiers will face the Louisville-Illinois State loser on Sunday. \n",
      " Scott Ota's two-run homer in the bottom of the first gave No. 3 UIC (29-23) its only lead, though the Flames tied it at 3 on Joshua Figueroa's RBI double in the third. \n",

      " NEW YORK (AP)  DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay  and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",
      " Rafael Devers homered early for the third-place Red Sox, who fell 8½ games back in the division. That's the furthest they've been behind the Yankees since finishing the 2015 season nine games in the dust. \n",
      " PIRATES 9, BREWERS 4 \n",
      " PITTSBURGH (AP)  Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",
      " REDS 9, NATIONALS 3 \n",
      " CINCINNATI (AP)  Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs  one shy of his career high  in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",
      " Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto's 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. \n",
      " Cincinnati's Joey Votto returned after missing three games with a tight right hamstring and had three hits. Eugenio Suarez was back in the lineup after getting hit on the left hand by Clay Holmes' pitch on Wednesday. \n",
      " TWINS 5, RAYS 3 \n",
      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP)  Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking, two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and Minnesota beat Tampa Bay in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " ROCKIES 13, BLUE JAYS 6 \n",
      " DENVER (AP)  Trevor Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and the Colorado Rockies beat the slumping Toronto Blue Jays for their sixth straight win. \n",
      " It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. \n",
      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",
      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. \n",
      " ORIOLES 9, GIANTS 5 \n",
      " BALTIMORE (AP)  Dwight Smith's first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Núñez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home as the teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. Núñez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " Richard Bleier got five outs for his second save. \n",
      " WHITE SOX 2, INDIANS 1 \n",
      " CHICAGO (AP)  Dylan Covey pitched six effective innings for his first win since August, and the White Sox beat sloppy Cleveland for their season-high fifth straight win. \n",
      " Charlie Tilson hit a two-run double to get Chicago's offense rolling. Tilson, Yoán Moncada, Yonder Alonso and Yolmer Sánchez each had two hits. The win moved the White Sox into a second-place tie in the AL Central with Cleveland. \n",
      " The Indians committed four errors. Four of Chicago's six runs against slumping Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer were unearned. \n",
      " Covey (1-4) settled down after allowing a leadoff homer to Francisco Lindor and scattered eight hits and ended a personal six-game losing streak. Josh Osich and Juan Minaya followed with three innings of one-hit relief. \n",
      " Bauer (4-5) allowed nine hits and struck out eight in seven innings, but shaky fielding doomed the right-hander. \n",
      " TIGERS 8, BRAVES 2 \n",
      " ATLANTA (AP)  Niko Goodrum homered twice and had a career-high five hits, Nicholas Castellanos and Grayson Greiner also went deep, and the Detroit Tigers romped past the Braves. \n",
      " Spencer Turnbull (3-4) pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just five hits and one earned run in dealing the Braves their third straight loss at SunTrust Park. \n",
      " Goodrum, who came into the night hitting just .208, launched a 419-foot drive that nearly went into the Chop House restaurant above the right-field seats in the third inning. He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",
      " After two straight strong starts, Atlanta's Mike Foltynewicz (1-4) had another rough night. Foltynewicz surrendered seven hits and five runs in five innings. \n",
      " Atlanta has been outscored 22-6 in its last two defeats. \n",
      " RANGERS 6, ROYALS 2 \n",
      " ARLINGTON, Texas (AP)  Joey Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth-inning outburst as the Rangers rallied past the Kansas City Royals. \n",
      " Gallo's home run, his team leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. He allowed two runs on five hits and three walks and had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks  both in the sixth. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Adalberto Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base, giving the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",
      " CARDINALS 2, CUBS 1, 10 INNINGS \n",
      " ST. LOUIS (AP)  Matt Carpenter hit a game-ending single against an unusual defensive alignment in the 10th to lead the Cardinals past the Chicago Cubs. \n",
      " The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage for May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). They went 8-18 in May 1980. \n",
      " Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter, and put four players on the right side of the infield. But Carpenter drove in Wong with a fly ball that found the grass in the left field corner. \n",
      " Carlos Martínez pitched a perfect eighth for St. Louis, and Jordan Hicks (2-2) worked two scoreless innings. The last pitch Hicks threw in the ninth registered at 104.3 mph, which is the fastest in baseball this season. \n",
      " MARINERS 4, ANGELS 3 \n",
      " SEATTLE (AP)  Jay Bruce hit his 300th career home run, Tom Murphy had a two-run shot, and the Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels. \n",
      " Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles, achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a dental procedure) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. \n",
      " The win snapped the Angels' three-game winning streak and wasted a fairly strong start by the Angels' Tyler Skaggs (4-5), who gave up just five hits but made a handful of costly mistakes while giving up four runs in seven innings. \n",
      " The Angels briefly got to Mike Leake (4-6) in the sixth inning when Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani hit back-to-back home runs to left field with two outs. It was the first time Los Angeles has hit consecutive home runs this season, but it wasn't enough for the Angels. \n",
      " PADRES 5, MARLINS 2 \n",
      " SAN DIEGO (AP)  Franmil Reyes, Hunter Renfroe and Ian Kinsler homered, and left-hander Joey Lucchesi combined with two relievers on a four-hitter for his first victory in six starts to lead the Padres past the Miami Marlins. \n",
      " Lucchesi (4-3) hadn't won since beating Cincinnati at home on April 21. He retired his first seven batters before allowing a double by Miguel Rojas in the third. He then retired eight straight before allowing a home run by pinch-hitter Rosell Herrera with one out in the sixth. Lucchesi struck out five and walked one. \n",
      " Craig Stammen pitched 1 2/3 hitless innings, Phil Maton allowed two singles to open the Marlins' ninth and Kirby Yates came on to get the final three outs for his 22nd save, best in the majors. \n",
      " Herrera was pinch-hitting for lefty Caleb Smith (3-3), who lost his third straight decision after allowing two runs and three hits in five innings. \n",
      " DODGERS 6, PHILLIES 3 \n",
      " LOS ANGELES (AP)  Max Muncy, Joc Pederson, Corey Seager and Enriquè Hernàndez homered, powering Los Angeles past Philadelphia in the opener of a series matching the National League's best teams. \n",
      " The West-leading Dodgers improved to a major league-best 23-7 at home and have won 11 of their last 15 at Chavez Ravine against the East-leading Phillies. The Dodgers' 39 victories lead the NL. Los Angeles rapped out 12 hits while limiting the Phillies to five, including two in the ninth. \n",
      " Kenta Maeda (7-2) allowed two runs and three hits in six innings and won his fourth straight start. He struck out six and walked none. Kenley Jansen earned his 17th save. \n",
      " Muncy and Seager belted two-run shots and Pederson had a solo homer off Jake Arrieta (5-5), who gave up five runs and 10 hits in five innings, striking out three and walking one. \n",
      " Philadelphia's Bryce Harper, Andrew McCutchen and Rhys Hoskins combined to go 2 for 12. McCutchen homered to lead off the fourth. \n",
      " ASTROS 3, ATHLETICS 2 \n",
      " OAKLAND, Calif. (AP)  Derek Fisher hit a tiebreaking homer to lead off the eighth inning for his first long ball of the season and the short-handed Houston Astros rallied to beat the Athletics. \n",
      " The Astros trailed the A's 2-0 heading into the seventh inning on a night they were missing injured stars Jose Altuvé, Carlos Correa and George Springer. But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A's their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. \n",
      " Héctor Rondón (3-1) pitched out of a jam in the seventh with help from a diving stop at shortstop by defensive replacement Jack Mayfield that held Ramón Laureano at third base with the infield drawn in. Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. \n",
      " Houston's Josh Reddick snapped an 0-for-15 rut with a solo homer. \n",
      " METS 5, DIAMONDBACKS 4 \n",
      " PHOENIX (AP)  Carlos Gómez snapped a tie with a pinch-hit double during New York's bizarre two-run eighth inning, sending the Mets past the Arizona Diamondbacks. \n",
      " Todd Frazier and Adeiny Hechavarria sparked New York's winning rally with consecutive two-out singles off Matt Andriese (3-4), putting runners on first and third. Pinch hitter J.D. Davis then hit a chopper toward the mound that bounced off Andriese's glove as he reached up. Marte could not handle the ball cleanly as the tying run scored. Gómez followed with a grounder inside the bag at third that drove in Hechavarría, but the ball boy stationed down the line  Arizona uses seniors dubbed \"Golden Glovers\"  fielded the ball thinking it was foul, and Davis was not permitted to score. \n",
      " Zack Wheeler (5-3) struck out nine in seven innings, and Robert Gsellman got three outs for his first save. \n",
      " Arizona lost its fifth straight game, matching a season high. Christian Walker and Ketel Marte homered for the Diamondbacks. \n",

      " So he called his neighbor to help out. The neighbor said \"You know, you could just snip a little bit of one horse's tail and leave the other one's intact, that way you can tell them apart by the length of the tail\". The man liked that idea and he took some scissors and snipped a bit of the first horse's tail. But the horse recoiled in pain and in a frenzy bit off the tip of the second horse's tail. Now they both had shortened tails. The two men looked and the neighbor got another idea: \"If you just snip a bit of the first one's ear, you could tell them apart that way\". So the man took his scissors and snipped a little part of the first horse's left ear but of course he began trashing around and in a frenzy bit off a small part of the other horse's left ear. The two men were really annoyed, but they wouldn't give up. \"Alright, do the other ear, you could still tell them apart that way\". But sure as hell, as the man snipped the first horse's other ear, he trashed around in pain and bit off a bit of the second horse's ear. They now both had snipped ears and tail. As the two men looked intensely for ideas, the neighbour said: \"Well you know, I think you could tell them apart by height. The brown one is a bit taller than the white one\" \n",

      " MORGANTOWN, W. Va. – A pair of four-run innings propelled the Duke baseball team to an 8-5 victory over second-seeded Texas A&M Friday afternoon at Monongalia County Ballpark. With the win, the Blue Devils improve to 31-25 on the season and advance into the NCAA Morgantown Regional winner’s bracket. \n",
      " The Blue Devils scored tallied their eight runs in the contest with four-run frames in both the fourth and the eighth to sandwich a Texas A&M run in the fifth. The Aggies rallied for four runs in the ninth, and brought the tying run to the plate, but Duke would hold on for the 8-5 victory. \n",
      " “I’m incredibly proud of our club,” said head coach Chris Pollard . “I thought we had a tremendous offensive approach against one of the best arms in the country. We kept our foot on the gas pedal after we had the big four-run inning and we were able to create some separation. The job by Ben Gross was tremendous. I can’t say enough about it.” \n",
      " Duke received a standout effort from its starter Ben Gross (7-4) who earned his team-leading seventh win of the season. The graduate student right-hander went 7.0 innings, allowing only one earned runs on four hits and two walks while collecting five strikeouts. The sophomore duo of Thomas Girard and Matt Dockman combined to work the final two innings, with Girard covering 1.1 frames, allowing four earned runs on two hits and one walk. Dockman picked up his first save of the season, working the final two-thirds of the ninth to secure the win. \n",
      " The Blue Devils struck first in the regional matchup, gaining the advantage with four runs in the fourth. With one down, sophomore Michael Rothenberg and graduate student Kyle Gallagher reached on back-to-back singles. In the next at-bat, junior Erikson Nichols connected on a deep drive to left field for a three-run shot to cross the first runs of the day. \n",
      " Sophomore Chris Crabtree continued the inning with a double to center field before advancing to third on a wild pitch. Crabtree came across to score in the next at-bat on a RBI groundout from freshman RJ Schreck to give Duke a 4-0 lead heading into the bottom of the fourth. \n",
      " The Aggies began to chip away at the deficit with one run in the fifth to make it a 4-1 contest. The Texas A&M leadoff man began things with a double to left field, before advancing to third on a fly out. A sacrifice fly in the next at-bat allowed the runner to score, giving the Aggies their first run of the day. \n",
      " Duke broke things open with another four-run inning in the eighth. Rothenberg led off the inning with a double to center field before Gallagher followed with a single to center. With runners on the corners, Rothenberg came across to score on a wild pitch for the first run of the frame. Nichols used the next at-bat to send a single through the right side, marking his third hit of the ballgame. In a pinch-hit attempt, freshman Rudy Maxwell launched his third home run of the season with a three-run shot to left to set the score at 8-1. \n",
      " Texas A&M made things interesting with four runs in the bottom of the ninth, while eventually bringing the tying run to the plate. With one down, a hit-by-pitch followed by a walk placed runners on first and second. A single through the right side in the next at-bat allowed one run to cross for the Aggies. After a hit-by-pitch loaded the bases, a wild pitch followed by a passed ball resulted in a pair of runs crossing for Texas A&M. The Aggies plated one more in the ninth with a single up the middle before the Blue Devils turned to Dockman for the final two outs to close out the 8-5 ballgame. \n",
      " Offensively, the Blue Devils were led by three-hit contests from Nichols and Gallagher, with the two also contributing two runs scored apiece. Nichols and Maxwell each tied for the team-high in RBI, each adding three apiece. \n",
      " With the win, Duke advances into the winner’s bracket of the NCAA Morgantown Regional. The Blue Devils are set for a 7 p.m. matchup Saturday night at Monongalia County Ballpark, and will face the winner of the West Virginia and Fordham contest.   \n",

      " GRANVILLE, W.Va. – Alek Manoah wanted to see and hear the atmosphere before pitching in it. \n",
      " West Virginia University baseball coach Randy Mazey said as much after the Mountaineers' NCAA Baseball Tournament Regional win over Fordham on Friday night. \n",
      " “We talked before (Friday’s) game and when he saw the crowd filing in he said, ‘I’m glad I’m not pitching in this first game. I needed to see this first before I pitched in it so I know what to expect,’” Mazey said. \n",
      " Nothing Manoah could have witnessed would have even prepared him for the third inning Saturday night. \n",
      " With multiple replays extending the inning, ejections to Mazey and a fan that climbed atop the West Virginia dugout and held onto protective netting to yell at the umpires, it all unraveled for the Mountaineers in a 4-0 loss to No. 3-seed Duke in a winners’ bracket game at Monongalia County Ballpark. \n",
      " “I thought we got a little bit outside ourselves,” said West Virginia assistant coach Steve Sabins. “It was like we couldn’t get our footing early on because it was so choppy.” \n",
      " The exasperating loss drops West Virginia (38-21) to an elimination game against second-seeded Texas A&M today at noon. The Aggies defeated Fordham 11-2 in the first elimination game earlier Saturday. The Mountaineers will need to defeat Texas A&M and win a pair of games against Duke (33-25), the first of two possible games tonight at 6 p.m., to advance to the Super Regionals for the first time in program history. \n",
      " The madness in the third inning started when Duke’s Erikson Nichols tapped a weak ground ball to the left side of the pitcher’s mound with the bases loaded. Off balance, Manoah fielded the ball and threw home for a force out that at first ended the inning. \n",
      " However, after a long review, it was determined West Virginia catcher Ivan Gonzalez didn’t have his foot on home plate and the run extended the Blue Devils’ lead to 3-0 and brought a pacing Macey into a face-to-face argument with the umpires, which led to his ejection. \n",
      " “I definitely thought it was an out,” Gonzalez said. “I thought I had possession and stepped on the plate. The call didn’t go our way and you just have to keep moving forward.” \n",
      " As the inning continued, Chris Crabtree sent a shallow, run-scoring line drive into center field to give Duke what seemed like an insurmountable 4-0 lead. \n",
      " “When the play happened (at home plate) I thought (Joey Loperfido) was out,” Duke coach Chris Pollard said. “Any time there is a play at the plate that is an automatic review, if requested. I felt like we had nothing to lose. We got the overturn. The separation we got was big because had we not pushed those two runs across, now every time West Virginia gets a guy on base the tying run is standing at the plate. With this crowd tonight, that would have been even tougher of an environment for our kids to push through.” \n",
      " The Blue Devils first took an early lead on a scary play in center field in the bottom of the first inning. A deep fly ball sent Mountaineers outfielder Brandon White sprinting for the warning track and the third out. The ball deflected off White’s glove as he dove and collided head-first with the padded wall. He laid motionless for several minutes. A cart was brought onto the field and White received medical attention but remained in the game. \n",
      " The two-run first inning — the other run scored on a wild pitch — was all Duke starting pitcher Bryce Jarvis needed. Relying mostly on pitches other than his fastball, Jarvis dominated the Mountaineers in his longest outing of the season. In eight innings, he scattered six hits, stranded seven runners on base and struck out 11. \n",
      " “Offspeed (pitches) have been a big part of my game this year,” Jarvis said. “The changeup has been my favorite pitch for a long time and that’s the best it has felt all season. That was just a big key in keeping guys off balance.” \n",
      " Manoah battled through six innings but was pulled after reaching 102 pitches. A projected top-15 pick in the first-round of the Major League Baseball draft that starts Monday, Manoah gave up all four runs but had nine strikeouts. He walked four. \n",
      " “I tried getting the team together in the fourth inning to tell guys to slow down. What we had done up to that point was not working,” Sabins said. “It was a tough game. It was an unusual game. I haven’t been a part of a game like that before. It didn’t go our way tonight.” \n",
      " Texas A&M 11, Fordham 2: \n",
      " Hunter Coleman hit a pair of home runs and starting pitcher Asa Lacy dominated with a substantial lead for the entirety as No. 2-seed Texas A&M cruised to an 11-1 victory over fourth-seeded Fordham in an elimination game Saturday afternoon. \n",
      " Lacy never stepped onto the mound without a lead as the Aggies scored five runs in the first inning and never looked back. Bryce Blaum hit a solo home run to left field and Coleman hit his first homer of the day, a three-run shot to the same part of the ballpark. \n",
      " Texas A&M (38-22-1) continued to add by scoring at least one run in four of the final six innings, including a two-run home run from Coleman in the seventh, to take a 10-1 lead. \n",
      " Unlike in the opener against West Virginia, Fordham (38-24) struggled to find offense early against Lacy. The Aggies’ left-handed sophomore surrendered his first hit when Andy Semo singled through the left side of the infield with two outs in the bottom of the fifth inning. \n",
      " Lacy went seven strong innings, allowed three hits, one run and struck out seven. \n",

      " AP Sports Writer \n",
      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",

He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man.

      " STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Davis Moore pitched a two-hitter over 6 2/3 innings, Emilio Nogales had three hits and drove in three runs and Fresno State advanced into Sunday's championship game of the Stanford Regional with a 7-2 victory over the top-seeded Cardinal on Saturday. \n",
      " McCarthy Tatum added a two-run double and Nolan Dempsey homered for the third-seeded Bulldogs (40-14-1), who have won nine straight and 14 of 15 overall. \n",
      " The last time Fresno State won its first two regional games was in 2008, when the Bulldogs went on to win the national title. \n",
      " Brandon Wulff gave Stanford (42-12) the early lead with his 18th home run, a solo shot with two outs in the first. \n",
      " Dempsey, who grew up about 10 miles from Sunken Diamond, tied the game with a monstrous home run in the fourth. \n",
      " Stanford starter Will Matthiessen went five innings, giving up a run on six hits. He struck out three and did not walk a batter. \n",
      " The Bulldogs took a 4-1 lead in the sixth against Stanford's bullpen. Jacob Palisch (4-2) faced two batters and both scored on Nogales' double. \n",
      " After giving up the home run in the first, Moore (10-1) did not allow a runner to venture past second base and did not give up a hit after Kyle Stowers singled in the third. He retired 10 of the final 11 hitters he faced. \n",
      " Moore pitched 6 2/3 innings, giving up a run on two hits. He walked three, hit two batters and struck out eight. Oscar Carvajal pitched the final 2 1/3 innings for the save. \n",

      " Print \n",
      " Nick Margevicius came back for his second big-league stint as the same pitcher he was at the beginning of his first big-league stint. \n",
      " But what he had been for three starts earlier this season, he was for just three innings on Saturday. \n",
      " Then suddenly, the 22-year-old left-hander couldn’t get an out, as a number of his poorly placed pitches helped launch the Marlins to a 9-3 victory at Petco Park. \n",
      " Six straight Marlins batters reached base to start the fourth inning before Padres manager Andy Green came out to remove the rookie. \n",
      " Margevicius retired nine of the first 10 batters he faced. Among the 35 pitches he took to get through those three innings were just a handful as meaty as the several fat pitches he offered up in the fourth inning. \n",
      " Margevicius threw 18 pitches in the fourth, including three fastballs and a curve up in the zone and one fastball on the inside edge that turned into three singles and a pair of doubles. He also issued a four-pitch walk. \n",
      " Luis Perdomo replaced Margevicius and got two outs before a line drive in and out of first baseman Eric Hosmer’s glove loaded the bases. Garrett Cooper’s single made it 5-2 before Perdomo ended the inning by striking out Brian Anderson. \n",
      " Bryan Holaday’s two-run homer off Adam Warren put the Marlins up 7-2 in the sixth inning. They added two runs off Robbie Erlin in the ninth. \n",
      " The Padres struggled with Marlins starter Jose Urena’s fastball, which routinely topped 95 mph and occasionally hit 97. They had just one hit through five innings and three hits in Urena’s six innings. \n",
      " Josh Naylors’ first career home run provided a 2-0 lead in the second inning. The Padres’ next hit would be Greg Garcia’s single leading off the sixth, and Garcia scored from third on Hosmer’s two-out single. \n",
      " Ian Kinsler’s one-out single in the seventh was their only other hit. \n",
      " Margevicius allowed just one run in each of his first three starts but posted a 6.75 ERA over his next six outings. He was sent down to Double-A on May 18 for the dual purpose of getting some rest and working on his command. \n",
      " After Saturday, the question becomes whether his next start is for the Padres or the Amarillo Sod Poodles. \n",

      " NEW YORK (AP) — DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",

      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",
      " REDS 9, NATIONALS 3 \n",
      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",
      " Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto's 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. \n",

      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking, two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and Minnesota beat Tampa Bay in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",

      " DENVER (AP) — Trevor Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and the Colorado Rockies beat the slumping Toronto Blue Jays for their sixth straight win. \n",
      " It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. \n",
      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",
      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. \n",

Núñez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",

      " Charlie Tilson hit a two-run double to get Chicago's offense rolling. Tilson, Yoán Moncada, Yonder Alonso and Yolmer Sánchez each had two hits. The win moved the White Sox into a second-place tie in the AL Central with Cleveland. \n",
      " The Indians committed four errors. Four of Chicago's six runs against slumping Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer were unearned. \n",
      " Covey (1-4) settled down after allowing a leadoff homer to Francisco Lindor and scattered eight hits and ended a personal six-game losing streak. Josh Osich and Juan Minaya followed with three innings of one-hit relief. \n",
      " Bauer (4-5) allowed nine hits and struck out eight in seven innings, but shaky fielding doomed the right-hander. \n",

      " Spencer Turnbull (3-4) pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just five hits and one earned run in dealing the Braves their third straight loss at SunTrust Park. \n",
      " Goodrum, who came into the night hitting just .208, launched a 419-foot drive that nearly went into the Chop House restaurant above the right-field seats in the third inning. He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",

      " Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks — both in the sixth. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Adalberto Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base, giving the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",
      " CARDINALS 2, CUBS 1, 10 INNINGS \n",
      " ST. LOUIS (AP) — Matt Carpenter hit a game-ending single against an unusual defensive alignment in the 10th to lead the Cardinals past the Chicago Cubs. \n",
      " The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage for May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). They went 8-18 in May 1980. \n",
      " Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter, and put four players on the right side of the infield. But Carpenter drove in Wong with a fly ball that found the grass in the left field corner. \n",
      " Carlos Martínez pitched a perfect eighth for St. Louis, and Jordan Hicks (2-2) worked two scoreless innings. The last pitch Hicks threw in the ninth registered at 104.3 mph, which is the fastest in baseball this season. \n",

      " SEATTLE (AP) — Jay Bruce hit his 300th career home run, Tom Murphy had a two-run shot, and the Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels. \n",
      " Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles, achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a dental procedure) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. \n",
      " The win snapped the Angels' three-game winning streak and wasted a fairly strong start by the Angels' Tyler Skaggs (4-5), who gave up just five hits but made a handful of costly mistakes while giving up four runs in seven innings. \n",
      " The Angels briefly got to Mike Leake (4-6) in the sixth inning when Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani hit back-to-back home runs to left field with two outs. It was the first time Los Angeles has hit consecutive home runs this season, but it wasn't enough for the Angels. \n",

      " Lucchesi (4-3) hadn't won since beating Cincinnati at home on April 21. He retired his first seven batters before allowing a double by Miguel Rojas in the third. He then retired eight straight before allowing a home run by pinch-hitter Rosell Herrera with one out in the sixth. Lucchesi struck out five and walked one. \n",
      " Craig Stammen pitched 1 2/3 hitless innings, Phil Maton allowed two singles to open the Marlins' ninth and Kirby Yates came on to get the final three outs for his 22nd save, best in the majors. \n",

      " The West-leading Dodgers improved to a major league-best 23-7 at home and have won 11 of their last 15 at Chavez Ravine against the East-leading Phillies. The Dodgers' 39 victories lead the NL. Los Angeles rapped out 12 hits while limiting the Phillies to five, including two in the ninth. \n",

      " The Astros trailed the A's 2-0 heading into the seventh inning on a night they were missing injured stars Jose Altuvé, Carlos Correa and George Springer. But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A's their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. \n",
      " Héctor Rondón (3-1) pitched out of a jam in the seventh with help from a diving stop at shortstop by defensive replacement Jack Mayfield that held Ramón Laureano at third base with the infield drawn in. Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. \n",
      " Houston's Josh Reddick snapped an 0-for-15 rut with a solo homer. \n",

Davis then hit a chopper toward the mound that bounced off Andriese's glove as he reached up. Marte could not handle the ball cleanly as the tying run scored. Gómez followed with a grounder inside the bag at third that drove in Hechavarría, but the ball boy stationed down the line — Arizona uses seniors dubbed \"Golden Glovers\" — fielded the ball thinking it was foul, and Davis was not permitted to score. \n",

      " By Todd KarpovichThe Associated Press \n",
      " BALTIMORE — Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the center field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.'s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " \"I feel like every time he is around I do something,\" the younger Smith said. \"He's a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.\" \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " \"It's been a rough couple of months,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We've had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.\" \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " \"A great day by the kid,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.\" \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz's ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn't allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " \"It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,\" Cashner said. \"I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.\" \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles' bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year's Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. \"Nothing's really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,\" Elias said. ... The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Orioles: OF Mark Trumbo (knee surgery) had his third rehab assignment for Double-A Bowie. He went 2 for 4 with a strikeout and run. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Giants: Shaun Anderson (0-1, 4.80 ERA) will make his fourth major-league start. He allowed six runs (four earned) and nine hits over five innings in his last outing May 26 against Arizona. \n",
      " Orioles: David Hess (1-6, 6.71 ERA) has not won since carrying a no-hitter into the seventh inning April 1 against Toronto. He has given up a league-leading 18 homers over 11 appearances. \n",

      " Bruce hits 300th HR to help Mariners beat Angels 4-3 \n",
      " By CHRIS TALBOTT Associated Press \n",
      " May 31, 2019 \n",
      " Save \n",
      " SEATTLE (AP) — Jay Bruce has accomplished a lot in 10 seasons in the major leagues. On Friday night, he experienced his own beer shower for the first time. \n",
      " Bruce hit his 300th career home run to join a fairly exclusive group, Tom Murphy hit a two-run shot, and the Seattle Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels 4-3. \n",
      " \"You know, a personal beer shower, that's probably my first one,\" Bruce said. \"It's good. Cold — it's very cold. If you had told me I was going to hit my 300th home run playing first base for the Seattle Mariners, I probably would have called you crazy.\" \n",
      " Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce, who was an outfielder for much of his career, became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles (he's got 301), achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a root canal) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. \n",
      " The win snapped the Angels' three-game winning streak and wasted a fairly strong start by Tyler Skaggs (4-5), who struck out eight and gave up just five hits but made a handful of costly mistakes while giving up four runs in seven innings. \n",
      " Skaggs' first mistake came a few pitches after Murphy doubled off the top of the wall in the third inning for the Mariners' first hit. Home plate umpire Lance Barksdale called a balk on Skaggs and sent Murphy to third. He easily scored on Dylan Moore's single for a 1-0 lead. \n",
      " Skaggs messed up again in the fifth when he walked Bruce with two outs. Murphy then homered to right field for a 3-0 lead. \n",
      " \"It's extremely frustrating,\" Skaggs said. \"I thought I was really, really good and the results didn't show up. But at the same time, a lot of positives today. I really, really felt like it was the best I looked this year and (I want to) keep it rolling into the next one.\" \n",
      " The Angels briefly got to Mike Leake (4-6) in the sixth inning when Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani hit back-to-back home runs to left field with two outs. It was the first time Los Angeles has hit consecutive home runs this season, but it wasn't enough for the Angels. \n",
      " Leake was otherwise flawless. He retired 14 of the first 15 batters he faced, didn't issue a walk against two strikeouts and scattered five hits in seven innings. He didn't allow a base runner other than Trout and Ohtani past first base. \n",
      " Servais thought it was Leake's best game in quite some time. \n",
      " \"Mike's a feel guy and he was feeling the breaking ball all night,\" he said. \n",
      " The Mariners' bullpen again struggled after Leake left. Reliever Austin Adams walked two players after starting the eighth with a popout. Servais went to Jesse Biddle, who allowed Ohtani to single in a run to cut the lead to 4-3. Biddle followed by walking Kole Calhoun to load the bases. Anthony Bass came on and induced a fly ball to end the threat and pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to earn his first save. He's one of seven Seattle relievers with at least one save this season. \n",
      " The Mariners, league leaders in errors, also got pristine defense with Murphy picking off a runner and Mitch Haniger making a diving catch in right field in the seventh, and Kyle Seager snatching up a slow roller barehanded in the ninth with a snap throw. Bass finished off the game with a strikeout. \n",

      " Abreu goes seven in Thunder shutout \n",
      " Yankees No. 3 prospect strikes out six, gives up two hits \n",
      " Friday's start marked the second time this season Albert Abreu has walked two batters or fewer. (Michael Dill/Trenton Thunder) \n",
      " By Chris Bumbaca / MiLB.com | May 31, 2019 10:35 PM \n",
      " Feel good, pitch good. It sounds simple, but it's the truth for Albert Abreu. \n",
      " In his longest outing of the season, the Yankees' third-ranked prospect fired seven scoreless innings. He allowed two hits and two walks, striking out six, as Double-A Trenton blanked Harrisburg, 2-0, on Friday at Arm & Hammer Park. \n",
      " \"He's been getting after it,\" Thunder pitching coach Tim Norton said. \"He's been ready for the first pitch of every inning, not easing into it, just kind of getting after it right from the get-go. He settled in and got in a good rhythm.\" \n",
      " Video: Trenton's Abreu whiffs sixth \n",
      " Nationals No. 2 prospect Luis Garcia led off the game with a single to center field. From there, it was all Abreu (2-4). \n",
      " The native of the Dominican Republic didn't allow another hit until his final inning. After issuing a leadoff walk to Austin Davidson in the fourth, Abreu retired nine in a row. Nats No. 20 prospect Tres Barrera opened the seventh with a double off the wall in center, but the 23-year-old recorded three straight outs to strand Barrera at third and protect a 1-0 lead. \n",
      " Gameday box score \n",
      " Finding a way to pitch out of trouble in key spots is a vital step in his development. \n",
      " \"You're starting to see it coming out of him in big spots, making big pitches and limiting damage, which is huge,\" Norton said. \"Once in a while, you're going to have those big innings. He's getting closer and closer to consistently leave guys out there in big spots. He came off the mound fired up, and he should have been, tight game like that. It was huge.\" \n",
      " Abreu threw 55 of 84 pitches for strikes in his first scoreless start of the season. The two free passes were the fewest he's allowed since walking a pair against New Hampshire on April 24. In his previous two starts, the 6-foot-2 righty issued 10 free passes over 10 2/3 innings, including a six-walk outing on May 24 at Binghamton, where he surrendered a season-high six runs in five frames. \n",
      " \"He's put together a really good stretch the last six or seven games,\" Norton said. \"The last one was a dud, of course, with the walks and everything. But he's been in a great spot.\" \n",
      " Abreu has begun rounding into form this month. Prior to the Binghamton outing, he yielded five runs -- four earned -- over 24 2/3 innings in his previous four outings. \n",
      " Throwing the ball over the plate is always an emphasis, and Norton described Friday's performance \"a comeback start\" in that regard. \n",
      " \"Everything he has is good,\" the pitching coach said. \"He has a terrific arm, two plus off-speed pitches. They just need to show up more consistently, and they're starting to. He's not far away. It's just about being consistent. I know that's the everyday answer, but he has what it takes so that when he needs to make a pitch, he makes a pitch.\" \n",
      " Abreu lowered his ERA to 4.11 and has 43 strikeouts over 50 1/3 innings. On Friday, his 65-grade fastball reached 100 mph as late as the fourth inning and his curveball was particularly sharp. The uptick in velocity is something Norton has seen more of this season. His fastball sat typically in the mid-90s last year. \n",
      " \"He came to us with that [velocity],\" the pitching coach said. \"Like a lot of guys, it fluctuates over two to three years. \n",
      " \"I think his arm just feels better this year, and you're starting to see him sit at 97, 98 in some starts.\" \n",
      " Abreu's health also has improved. He had three separate stints on the injured list in 2018, when all but one of his non-rehab starts were with Class A Advanced Tampa. Certain pitchers, Norton said, pitch differently when their arm feels better. \n",
      " \"It might be for a few months, it might be for a year,\" he said. \"I think that's just kind of the life of a pitcher, where it just doesn't feel 100 percent for a pitcher. He's coming out of the gates every game getting after it, and it's coming out hot. I'm sure it feels a little better, overall.\" \n",

I had 2 friends for most my life and they weren't really my friends either. As a kid all the way till now, I just had a different perspective on everything. Whatever all the other kids found funny, I never thought was funny. Whatever was popular with everyone wasn't popular with me. I also always have had a different opinion than everyone else. This was for literally everything. I was told by a lot of people that my opinions are shitty or dumb. I've also liked things that most people don't like and vice versa.

      " CINCINNATI (AP)  Tanner Roark's first career homer wasn't enough to get the win against his former Nationals teammates. Instead, it went to the other half of the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " ''A weird day,'' Nationals starter Eric Fedde said. \n",
      " Except for the outcome. Nothing surprising about the Nationals winning in Cincinnati. \n",
      " Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Nationals to a 5-2 victory - their ninth in 10 games at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason for Tanner Rainey. Both pitchers came away with a career moment. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Fedde, his first in 336 career plate appearances. \n",
      " ''I felt like my emotions were under control,'' said Roark, who went six innings. ''It's definitely a tough loss. The bunt and the home run felt good. I would've rather have won the game.'' \n",
      " Two homers made the difference. \n",
      " Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 36 2/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Rainey (1-1), who got into the game in the fifth. He acknowledged that he had extra motivation facing his former team, and he fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. \n",
      " ''For me getting the first win in here, it is special,'' Rainey said. \n",
      " Rainey fanned Yasiel Puig with a runner on third to end the fifth inning, and then struck out two more batters in the sixth. \n",
      " ''He's going to be a good one, he really is,'' manager Dave Martinez said. ''He has that look when he comes out of the bullpen that I really like,'' \n",
      " Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Washington's Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. It was the longest hitting streak by a player under age 21 since Manny Machado also hit in 14 straight games in 2013. \n",
      " DOMINATION \n",
      " The Nationals are 17-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " DOUBLE TROUBLE \n",
      " The Reds hit into double plays in the first, third and fifth innings, helping Fedde escape trouble. \n",
      " ''That's the best I could have hoped for,'' said Fedde, who gave up six hits and three walks in four-plus innings. ''That's when the ground ball really comes into play. That saved me today.'' \n",
      " STREAKS \n",
      " Washington's Anthony Rendon has reached base in 18 consecutive games, going 22 for 64 with six doubles, two triples, four homers and 16 walks. Cincinnati's Nick Senzel doubled, extending his streak to nine games, the longest by a Red this season. \n",

      " Goodrum's 2 homers, 5 hits lead Tigers past Braves 8-2 \n",
      " By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer \n",
      " Posted May 31 2019 10:49PM EDT \n",
      " ATLANTA (AP) - Niko Goodrum homered twice and had a career-high five hits, Nicholas Castellanos and Grayson Greiner also went deep, and the Detroit Tigers romped to an 8-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Friday night. \n",
      " Spencer Turnbull pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just five hits and one earned run in dealing the Braves their third straight loss at SunTrust Park. \n",
      " Goodrum, who came into the night hitting just .208, launched a 419-foot drive that nearly went into the Chop House restaurant above the right-field seats in the third inning. He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. \n",
      " Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",
      " Greiner homered in the second, and Castellanos added a two-run shot that capped a fifth that was sparked by JaCoby Jones' leadoff triple. He got his left foot to the bag just ahead of Josh Donaldson's tag on the knee - a call that was challenged by the Braves but upheld after a video review. \n",
      " Buck Farmer came on in the seventh when the Braves loaded the bases against Turnbull (3-4) with no outs. Atlanta got a run on Brian McCann's sacrifice fly and reloaded the bases when Ozzie Albies reached on an infield single that deflected off Farmer's glove. But the Tigers reliever escaped the jam when pinch hitter Charlie Culberson grounded into an inning-ending double play. \n",
      " After two straight strong starts, Atlanta's Mike Foltynewicz (1-4) had another rough night. His slider was dominating at times - he struck out eight - but too many mistakes up in the zone doomed the right-hander. \n",
      " Foltynewicz surrendered seven hits and five runs in five innings. \n",
      " Atlanta has been outscored 22-6 in its last two defeats. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Tigers: 1B Miguel Cabrera left in the sixth inning with right knee soreness. He was listed as day to day. \n",
      " Braves: OF Ender Inciarte isn't close to returning to the active roster. \"He hasn't started his baseball stuff yet,\" manager Brian Snitker said. \"He needs to come in a few days in a row feeling pretty good, amp up his running and things like that before we see him swinging a bat.\" Inciarte has been on the injured list since May 15 with a lumbar strain. ... Snitker also doused any hope that RHP Darren O'Day (forearm strain) might be getting close to bolstering the beleaguered Atlanta bullpen. \"He hasn't even thrown off the mound yet,\" the manager said. \"He's a ways away.\" \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Atlanta right-hander Mike Soroka (5-1) will look to continue his brilliant start to the season when he faces Detroit lefty Daniel Norris (2-3, 4.18 ERA) on Saturday afternoon. Soroka has yet to allow more than one earned run in any of his eight starts and comes in with a minuscule 1.07 ERA. He is just a few innings shy of qualifying for the lowest ERA in the majors. \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",

      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",
      " — Oregon State's Adley Rutschman, batting .420 and the likely No. 1 pick in next week's Major League Baseball draft, was intentionally walked with the bases loaded to pull the Beavers within 5-3 in the seventh inning. \n",

''It's general wear and tear from a thrower's shoulder,'' Tomczyk said before the game.

      " FLORA — Daleville has enjoyed the kind of baseball success lately to where it can afford to be picky. \n",
      " The defending state champions celebrated everything about Saturday's 11-3 Class 1A regional semifinal victory against Blue River Valley except the fact it could have ended an inning earlier. \n",
      " A base-running mistake short-circuited a sixth-inning rally, and the Broncos (17-11) spent a few more precious minutes in the sun prior to a championship game matchup against No. 2 Rossville. \n",
      " But those are the kind of nits a program seeking its third regional title in four years can afford to pick. \n",
      " Cayden Gothrup was masterful on the mound, a high-powered offense continued its late-season roll and Daleville earned a rematch with the last team to hand it a postseason defeat. \n",
      " Rossville knocked off the Broncos in the regional semifinals in 2017. \n",
      " \"We're on a roll again,\" Daleville coach Terry Turner said. \"We've been getting timely hitting, and our pitching's been pretty good.\" \n",
      " That's a bit of an understatement. \n",
      " The afternoon victory pushed the Broncos' aggregate score to 50-3 through four tournament games. \n",
      " And the offense wasted little time getting things rolling against the Vikings (8-14-1). \n",
      " Daleville plated four runs in the top of the first, taking advantage of four hits and three Blue River Valley errors. \n",
      " Max Stecher — who finished 3-for-4 with three runs scored — and Gothrup got things started with one-out singles. Peyton Smith brought the first run in on a fielder's choice, and Jared Waltermire added an RBI single to make it 2-0. \n",
      " The big hit in the frame came from catcher Ethan Pittsford, who laced an RBI double into the gap and later scored the inning's final run after an error. \n",
      " That proved to be all the offense Gothrup needed. \n",
      " He surrendered eight hits and three earned runs over 6.1 innings, striking out eight and walking just one. Turner admitted he left the left-hander in an inning longer than he normally would as he attempted to save arms for the championship game. \n",
      " Waltermire got the final two outs on a double play turned by Stecher off a short line drive. \n",
      " \"I thought (Gothrup) pitched well,\" Turner said. \"He did a nice job of mixing his pitches up and throwing strikes.\" \n",
      " The Broncos added single runs in the second and third innings on a single by Gothrup and a sacrifice fly by Evan Etchison. A single by Jimmy Bowen made it 7-0 in the fifth. \n",
      " The runs in the second and fifth innings were set up by triples from Stecher and Etchison, respectively. \n",
      " Daleville's 15 hits came from eight different batters, and five hitters enjoyed multi-hit games. \n",
      " Gothrup joined Stecher at 3-for-4, Pittsford went 2-for-3 and Josh Price and Bowen each finished 2-for-4. Smith had just one hit in four at-bats, but he drove in a team-high three runs. Pittsford and Bowen knocked in two each. \n",
      " \"That's been the beauty of our team right now,\" Turner said of the offensive balance. \"We're just feeding off each other.\" \n",
      " The Vikings attempted to rally in the final two innings against a tiring Gothrup. They loaded the bases in the sixth with just a single ball leaving the infield, and Clayton Hamm's two-out single brought the first two runs home. \n",
      " Daleville responded with a two-run single by Smith and one-run singles by Pittsford and Bowen to regain a comfortable advantage in the bottom of the frame. \n",
      " Blue River Valley again loaded the bases in the seventh but got only an RBI single by Brayden Thompson before Stecher's double play ended the game. \n",

      " BALTIMORE (AP) — Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the center field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.'s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " \"I feel like every time he is around I do something,\" the younger Smith said. \"He's a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.\" \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " \"It's been a rough couple of months,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We've had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.\" \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " \"A great day by the kid,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.\" \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz's ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn't allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " \"It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,\" Cashner said. \"I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.\" \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles' bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year's Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. \"Nothing's really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,\" Elias said. ... The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",

      " BALTIMORE (AP) — Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the center field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.’s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " “I feel like every time he is around I do something,” the younger Smith said. “He’s a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.” \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " “It’s been a rough couple of months,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “We’ve had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.” \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " “A great day by the kid,” Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. “He’s done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.” \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith’s grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz’s ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn’t allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " “It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,” Cashner said. “I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.” \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles’ bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year’s Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players.

      " The arrival of vacation season means it’s time to stop daydreaming about that getaway and start making some travel plans. \n",
      " Getting organized for a grand adventure, especially if you’ll be traveling with a group, requires some careful planning before you begin making reservations. Get started planning your dream vacation with these travel tips from the experts at Vrbo: \n",
      " Narrow down the location. Vacation planning often begins with an idea more than a specific destination. For example, you may want to lay on the beach or visit the mountains. The first step should be figuring out exactly which beach or which mountain range captures your attention. Research your options online and look for information such as lodging, food and activities you may want to explore. \n",
      " Set a budget. Daydreaming about a luxury excursion may be appealing when it’s all in theory, but your bank account may have a different opinion. Also remember that if you’re traveling with a group, you’re likely to encounter household finances different from your own, so you’ll need to set a budget that works for everyone. \n",
      " Determine how you’ll get there. The smaller your group, the more options you have for reaching your destination. As the group grows, you may have fewer alternatives, particularly if you want to travel together. For example, it can be difficult to get a large block of seats together on a commercial flight. \n",
      " Think about where you’ll stay. Vacation rentals typically offer more space and privacy than hotel rooms and allow everyone to stay together. Many offer amenities like a backyard or pool, and guests can split the cost several ways. You can give others a chance to weigh in with a tool like Trip Boards, a feature on the Vrbo website and mobile app that lets friends and family members collaborate during the decision-making process and find the perfect vacation home together. With inviting, voting and commenting capabilities, fellow travelers can see each other’s favorited properties, vote and leave comments on which vacation homes they like best. \n",
      " Discuss an itinerary ahead of time. With multiple personalities and interests involved, it can be challenging to keep everyone on a set schedule. Some may prefer to sleep in and others may have specific ideas about what time meals should be. Even if you don’t have a formal itinerary, it’s a good \n",
      " idea to talk through the schedule ahead of time, so expectations are clear. Breaking off into smaller groups part of the time may work better than keeping the entire group on the same schedule throughout the trip. \n",
      " Look for group discounts. Though a larger group poses some challenges, there are also some perks that make bigger better. As you’re planning activities and making reservations, be sure to inquire about specials and rates reserved for larger parties. \n",
      " Use apps to get organized. From organizing everyone’s travel schedules to voting on activities and coordinating payments, you can rely on apps to orchestrate most of the minutiae of a group getaway. \n",

New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row.

      " A do’s and dont’s list to get the perfect six pack (Shutterstock) \n",
      " It seems as if everybody is chasing six-pack abs even when they are supposedly doing core training! Let me make this clear that core training and working the abs is as different as chalk and cheese. Working towards a chiseled midriff requires very specific training and diet strategy. I am perennially asked about which exercises would help in losing belly fat. You can do loads of crunches but spot reduction is not possible. Let’s try to understand what we need to do to achieve abs that stand out. \n",
      " Females with less than 15 per cent body fat will have abs that can be clearly seen         (         Shutterstock         ) \n",
      " The Rectus Abdominus or the abs is a thick sheaf of muscle, which runs vertically from the sternum to the pubis. When a person has sufficiently low percentage of body fat, about 10 per cent for men and 15 per cent for women, the abs can be clearly seen. If a trainee has been working the abs properly, such that they have hypertrophied plus they have low body fat, then the six pack appears! \n",
      " When the percentage of body fat in men is lower than 10 per cent, the six pack is visible         (         Shutterstock         ) \n",
      " I mentioned the body fat percentages first because unless you have diligently worked on your diet and reduced body fat, it’s pointless doing crunch after crunch. It is very clear that you cannot out-train a bad diet. Also, getting into the single-digit body fat percentage is not fun as it entails making substantial lifestyle changes. Most people fail at it and thus the perennial search for the six-pack. \n",
      " Without the right diet and reduced body fat, it’s pointless to do crunch after crunch         (         Shutterstock         ) \n",
      " What not to do if you are looking for a six pack \n",
      " •Focus on doing endless abdominal exercises. \n",
      " •Cheat on your diet. \n",
      " •Try to burn belly fat by doing lots of cardio. \n",
      " •Fall for snake oil-pushing salesmen, offering untested, unknown products for reducing body fat. \n",
      " •Resorting to “fat burners”, available by the dozen at supplement shops. Most of these supplements do not list their full ingredients, hiding behind phrases like “proprietorial blend of natural ingredients”. \n",
      " How to get to six pack abs \n",
      " I would like to divide this section into two parts. Let’s focus on the diet part first. If you are dead serious about getting lean, then my recommendation is consult a good, experienced nutritionist. The nutritionist will help you modify your diet scientifically without causing any health issues. Basically, you need to get into a calorie deficit to lose body fat. This can be done by cutting calories or shifting to a Ketogenic diet or a mix of the two. Whatever might be the chosen route, my only recommendation is not to cut protein, otherwise training in the gym gets poor results. \n",
      " Now for the training: \n",
      " •Abs are like any other muscle. You don’t need to do thousands of repetitions six days a week. They need to be trained with progressive overload about twice a week, keeping the reps in the 12-15 range. \n",
      " •Weighted crunches, ab pull-downs on a pulley machine, hanging leg raises are the main exercises for overloading the abs. \n",

      " •Progressively overloading the abs will make them hypertrophy, just like your biceps. So when you are lean enough, the abs will stick out. \n",
      " So there are you are – get lean and hit your abs hard. Now you can go bare torso anytime, anywhere! \n",

      " Posted: Fri 10:07 PM, May 31, 2019 \n",
      " ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) Joey Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth inning outburst as the Texas Rangers rallied past the Kansas City Royals 6-2 Friday night. \n",
      " Gallo's home run, his team leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet and landed in the second seating area beyond the center-field wall. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. Jurado allowed two runs on five hits and three walks. The second-year right-hander, who was recalled from Triple-A Nashville on April 26, had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks - both in the sixth. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. \n",
      " Texas loaded the bases in the sixth inning on outfield singles by Shin-Soo Choo and Elvis Andrus and a chopper hit between third base and the mound by Hunter Pence. Duffy fielded Pence's grounder, but his throw to first base was late. \n",
      " Duffy walked Nomar Mazara with the bases loaded to tie the score 2-2. Gallo then launched a 1-1 fastball to end a six-game homerless streak, which matched his longest this season. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Cuthbert, who earlier Friday had his contract selected from Triple-A Omaha, hit an opposite-field homer that just cleared the right-field wall in the second. \n",
      " Gordon's triple in the fifth inning turned around centerfielder Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway center, scoring  Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10 1/2-game in the AL Central.

      " Home Run Record Shattered \n",
      " Vladimir Guerrero broke a home run record on Friday. He may break a lot of records for his personal exploits during his career but this one was a league-wide effort. MLB teams combined to hit 1,135 home runs in the month of May, which broke an all-time record for the most longballs in any month of any season in baseball history. The previous record was 1,119 homers in August of 2017. Guerrero's home run in Coors Field on Friday was the 1,120th dinger of the month around baseball. 15 more homers were hit later in the evening and a total of 40 balls left the yard on the day. \n",
      " Three players hit 12 home runs in the month -- Josh Bell , Alex Bregman and Derek Dietrich . Bell had 94 total bases in May, which is the first time anyone has done that since Willie Mays in 1958. Dietrich accomplished the feat in only 69 at-bats. He ranks fifth in the majors with 17 homers in just 123 at-bats this year as a part-time player. \n",
      " The record for home runs in a season is 6,105 in 2017.  So far this season there have been 2,279 home runs hit, which puts the league on a pace for 6,395 dongs this year. There is plenty of evidence the baseball is juiced this year but the home run binge is not a recent phenomenon and there are many reasons for it. Home runs levels have been growing for decades and were reaching record levels even before the new baseballs hit the field. Sabermetrics has shown that the best way to win a baseball game is to hit home runs, so teams are instructing their players to adjust their launch angles to improve their chances of going deep. Gone are the days of \"small ball\" -- putting the ball in play and spraying the ball to all fields. This is the epoch of \"grip it and rip it\" to the pull side. Players are bigger and stronger than ever before. Pitch velocities are up, which leads to higher exit velocities off the bat. All these factors create a perfect storm for increased power. \n",
      " From a fantasy perspective there are two philosophies for dealing with the home run binge. Some owners feel like they don't have to invest so heavily in the best home run hitters because it is possible to find plenty of dingers in cheaper players later in the draft and even off the waiver wire during the season. When there are dozens of players putting up big home run numbers (48 players hit 25 or more bombs last year) why pay big prices to get sluggers like Khris Davis , who lead the majors with 48 dingers last year? Or Joey Gallo , who cracked 40 bombs but had a .206 batting average? On the other hand, if you don't invest early and often in sluggers you could find your team deeply buried in the power categories by the teams who do grab those players. As always in fantasy baseball, balancing categories to maximize point totals is key and you can't afford to fall too far behind in any category if you want to win the championship. \n",

He blasted a two-run bomb off Blue Jays starter Edwin Jackson , who was rocked for 10 runs in the game. Story then cracked another two-run shot off reliever Sam Gaviglio in the seventh frame. Story has 10 hits, including six for extra bases, in his last three games, and his OPS stands at .923 on the season. He is slashing .294/.362/.561 with 15 home runs and 42 RBI. He leads the major leagues with 52 runs scored. He has stolen 10 bases as well. Story is ranked number three overall on the Yahoo Fantasy Baseball player rankings, behind only Cody Bellinger and Christian Yelich . Story ranks ahead of Josh Bell and teammate Nolan Arenado , both of whom have hit the ball slightly better but they don't steal bases, which leaves them looking up at the top three players. Story is just 26 years old and has already proven himself to be one of the most consistent all-around fantasy studs in the league. \n",

      " Goodrum Has Best Game of Career \n",
      " Niko Goodrum hasn't proven much of anything yet in his career but he had a monster day at the dish on Friday, going 5-for-5 with two home runs, four runs scored and three RBI as the Tigers topped the Braves 8-2 in Atlanta. He slugged a solo home run off of Mike Foltynewicz in the third inning, drove in a run with a single in the fifth, and added another solo tater off Josh Tomlin in the eighth. He also doubled in the ballgame. That is a powerful day at the plate for a leadoff hitter. It was the first five-hit game of his three-year career. The great game boosted his line to .230/.316/.399 with six home runs, 17 RBI, 29 runs and four stolen bases in 50 games. He is just 17%-owned in Yahoo leagues. His track record shows a guy with some power and speed who strikes out a lot and struggles to hit for average.

Bruce is the 148th player in major league history to hit 300 home runs. He is currently tied with Hall of Famer Chuck Klein and needs one more to tie Rogers Hornsby. Bruce ranks ninth among all active players -- Albert Pujols is first with 642 and is followed by Miguel Cabrera with 467. Giancarlo Stanton is eighth with 305 taters and Bruce could catch him while he is on the injured list with multiple ailments. Bruce is only 32 years old and has a realistic shot of reaching the 400-homer plateau before he retires. Only 55 players have ever hit 400 home runs and only two of them are active. \n",

      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Tanner Roark's first career homer wasn't enough to get the win against his former Nationals teammates. Instead, it went to the other half of the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " \"A weird day,\" Nationals starter Eric Fedde said. \n",
      " Except for the outcome. Nothing surprising about the Nationals winning in Cincinnati. \n",
      " Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Nationals to a 5-2 victory — their ninth in 10 games at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason for Tanner Rainey. Both pitchers came away with a career moment. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Fedde, his first in 336 career plate appearances. \n",
      " \"I felt like my emotions were under control,\" said Roark, who went six innings. \"It's definitely a tough loss. The bunt and the home run felt good. I would've rather have won the game.\" \n",
      " Two homers made the difference. \n",
      " Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 36 2/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Rainey (1-1), who got into the game in the fifth. He acknowledged that he had extra motivation facing his former team, and he fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. \n",
      " \"For me getting the first win in here, it is special,\" Rainey said. \n",
      " Rainey fanned Yasiel Puig with a runner on third to end the fifth inning, and then struck out two more batters in the sixth. \n",
      " \"He's going to be a good one, he really is,\" manager Dave Martinez said. \"He has that look when he comes out of the bullpen that I really like,\" \n",
      " Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Washington's Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. It was the longest hitting streak by a player under age 21 since Manny Machado also hit in 14 straight games in 2013. \n",

      " OKLAHOMA CITY — The Washington Huskies knew it would be a tough road after losing their opener at the Women’s College World Series, needing to win four consecutive games to get back to the title series for the second season in a row. \n",
      " With senior Taran Alvelo leading the way during a long Saturday, the Huskies are halfway there. \n",
      " The Huskies (52-8) finished off their day by beating Oklahoma State 1-0 on Alvelo’s pitching gem, leaving the Huskies as one of four teams remaining in the WCWS. \n",
      " Washington had little time to celebrate with a 10 a.m. game (PDT) against Pac-12 foe UCLA on Sunday awaiting them. If UW wins that game, a second game with UCLA would take place at 4 p.m. \n",
      " The Bruins  (53-6) should be well rested after getting Saturday off, but the Huskies have momentum. \n",
      " Alvelo started for the Huskies and was dominant, racking up strikeouts at a remarkable pace. She allowed three hits and no walks and struck out 16. The WCWS record for strikeouts in a seven-inning is 18, set by Texas’ Cat Osterman in 2006. \n",
      " Advertising \n",
      " Amirah Milloy, robbed of a homer earlier in the game, was not denied in the fourth inning. She hit a two-out single to right field to drive in a run when it looked like the Huskies might squander having runners on first and third with no outs. \n",
      " The Cowgirls didn’t make it easy for UW, and they made the first huge play of the game, in the second inning. Milloy hit a blast to center field that seemed destined for the seats for a two-run homer, but Chyenne Factor leaped at the right time, bringing down the ball from a couple feet above the fence. \n",
      " But Milloy made that not matter two innings later. \n",
      " Left-fielder Sami Reynolds helped protect the lead with a running catch before slamming into the wall to end the top of the sixth inning. \n",
      " The Huskies earned their way to Saturday’s late game against Oklahoma State with a 5-3 win over Minnesota that was delayed by 3 hours 9 minutes after the fifth inning because of inclement weather. \n",
      " Alvelo came into the game to get the final out after starter Gabbie Plain (24-2) ran into trouble in the bottom of the seventh, allowing a pair of runs and leaving the potential tying run at second base. \n",
      " Alvelo struck out MaKenna Partain, the Gophers; leading hitter with a .375 average. \n",
      " Advertising \n",
      " Morganne Flores hit her 23rd homer of the season and Sami Reynolds had a two-run double to lead UW’s offense in the opener. \n",
      " Plain allowed the three runs on four hits and three walks. \n",
      " “I think I just got a little too far ahead of myself, trying to get to the end of the game,” Plain said. “When Taran came on, I knew she had it. I knew she was going to have my back. I’ve got complete trust in her.” \n",

      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Tanner Roark's first career homer wasn't enough to get the win against his former Nationals teammates. Instead, it went to the other half of the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " \"A weird day,\" Nationals starter Eric Fedde said. \n",
      " Except for the outcome. Nothing surprising about the Nationals winning in Cincinnati. \n",

      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Rainey (1-1), who got into the game in the fifth. He acknowledged that he had extra motivation facing his former team, and he fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. \n",

      " ATLANTA -- Niko Goodrum homered twice and had a career-high five hits, Nicholas Castellanos and Grayson Greiner also went deep, and the Detroit Tigers romped to an 8-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Friday night. \n",

      " Buck Farmer came on in the seventh when the Braves loaded the bases against Turnbull (3-4) with no outs. Atlanta got a run on Brian McCann's sacrifice fly and reloaded the bases when Ozzie Albies reached on an infield single that deflected off Farmer's glove. But the Tigers reliever escaped the jam when pinch hitter Charlie Culberson grounded into an inning-ending double play. \n",
      " After two straight strong starts, Atlanta's Mike Foltynewicz (1-4) had another rough night. His slider was dominating at times -- he struck out eight -- but too many mistakes up in the zone doomed the right-hander. \n",

      " Easy-breezy: Planning ahead can make a picnic just that \n",
      " By KATIE WORKMAN  The Associated Press \n",
      " 5:30 am \n",
      " AP photo \n",
      " Caption \n",
      " This May 2019 photo shows containers being packed in a picnic basket in New York. Whether it's a simple al fresco lunch or a romantic repast for two, a successful picnic takes planning. Make a checklist and gather ideas for which foods work best. \n",
      " As the weather warms up, many of us start thinking about enjoying our meals outdoors. \n",
      " But a seamless, successful picnic takes some planning. Having a checklist and some ideas for what foods work best can keep the easy-breezy notion of a summer picnic just that. \n",
      " Whether you are looking to create a simple alfresco lunch or a more stylish meal, a potluck menu for a group or a romantic repast for two, be prepared. I have learned the hard way that garbage bags and bottle openers don’t just appear in fields. \n",
      " THE CARRIERS \n",
      " Anything from a classic picnic basket to a sturdy, flat-bottomed bag to a metal or plastic bin or box. Include some sort of cooler. \n",
      " THE FOOD \n",
      " Choose simple dishes that require no fussing over at the picnic. Steer clear of fragile foods, and take items that won’t get soggy, are delicious at room temperature, can stand up to some time in the sun, and can be eaten with your hands or just a fork – it’s hard to cut things on a paper plate balanced on your lap. \n",
      " Usually, picnics don’t have the prescribed flow of a regular indoor meal. It’s quite acceptable and lovely that someone might be munching on a piece of frittata while others are eating cookies. \n",
      " But if you plan on a more leisurely afternoon, you may want to put out some nibbley things to start. \n",
      " Cheese plus bread or crackers are always welcome, supplemented by olives, cornichons, nuts, dried fruit and condiments like fig jam or chutney. \n",
      " If you make a crostini topping or two, put that out along with some toasted baguette slices brushed with olive oil and let people assemble their own. Think about a dip and some cut-up vegetables. There are lots of interesting salsas to make or buy to pair with chips. \n",
      " If you are bringing a lettuce salad or anything that can wilt quickly, pack the dressing separately and toss it there. Sturdier grain and vegetables salads can be made and dressed just before leaving (some grain, pasta or potato salads can happily be made up to a couple days ahead of time). \n",
      " Sandwiches are always good, but pack them tightly so they don’t fall apart. Fried chicken, grilled or roasted chicken (so good cold), salads featuring proteins like chicken or tuna, quiches, frittatas – truly, anything you are happy eating at room temperature is fair game. Include at least one vegetarian and one gluten-free option if you think those might be needed. \n",
      " Avoid desserts that need to be cut and plated, like pies and cakes. Go with pre-cut durable sweets like brownies, bar cookies, drop cookies. \n",
      " Grapes, cherries, cut melon and strawberries are good, packable fruit offerings. \n",
      " As for drinks, bring an assortment in cans or bottles. If you are going to a park, make sure glass bottles and/or alcohol are allowed; boxed or canned wine may be your friend, and there are some good ones out there. \n",
      " Maybe pack a Thermos or two of iced tea or lemonade. Keep drinks chilled with lots of ice. \n",
      " DISPOSABLE OR REUSABLE? \n",
      " We are all trying to be greener. And for a smaller group, at least, reusables are often more attractive and eco-friendly. Bring an extra bag for recycling. \n",
      " MAKE THAT LIST! \n",

      " SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Meibrys Viloria hit a bases-clearing double in the first inning, and Travis Jones tripled and doubled as the Northwest Arkansas Naturals beat the Springfield Cardinals 12-5 on Saturday. \n",
      " The double by Viloria capped a four-run inning and gave the Naturals a 4-0 lead after Khalil Lee hit an RBI single earlier in the inning. \n",
      " Trailing 7-2, the Cardinals cut into the deficit in the fourth inning when Dylan Carlson hit a two-run home run. \n",
      " The Naturals later scored in three additional innings to punctuate the blowout, including three runs in the eighth. \n",
      " NW Arkansas starter Brady Singer (1-0) picked up the win despite allowing four runs over five innings. Opposing starter Johan Oviedo (1-2) took the loss in the Texas League game after a rough outing in which he allowed eight runs and nine hits over five innings. \n",
      " Carlson homered and doubled, scoring three runs and driving home a couple for the Cardinals. \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",

      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids - Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",

      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pittsburgh Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin in a 9-4 victory Friday night. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Archer struck out seven and walked two while needed only 92 pitches to get 21 outs as the injury-ravaged Pirates won for only the third time in their last 11 games. \n",
      " Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command briefly abandoned him in the third inning. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh's lead to 5-1. Peralta replaced Chacin and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh's advantage to 7-1. \n",
      " Chacin — a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series — saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " Aguilar hit his first home run in a month when he took Archer to the bushes beyond the center-field wall in leading off the third. Hiura pushed Milwaukee's home run total to 98 — tops in the National League — with a three-run shot to center in fourth. \n",
      " Hiura had three of Milwaukee's six hits, but the second baseman was also charged with two of the Brewers' three errors on a funky play in the seventh when a liner by Jacob Stallings deflected off Peralta's glove to Hiura, who couldn't corral it initially, then threw into the Milwaukee dugout when he rushed his throw in an effort to get Stallings. \n",

      " Brewers: C Manny Pina (right hamstring discomfort) is expected to rejoin Milwaukee over the weekend. Pina is hitting .300 (3 for 10) during a rehab stint with Class A Wisconsin entering Friday. \n",
      " Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles (left hamstring discomfort) will start Sunday's series finale. Lyles exited a loss to Cincinnati last Tuesday after tweaking the hamstring in the fourth inning. ... RHP Keone Kela will be shut down for 10 days after the right shoulder discomfort that sent him to the injured list popped back up during a rehab assignment. \n",

      " Pirates: Nick Kingham (1-1, 8.28) hasn't won a game as a starter since last July, but will get the nod on Saturday. Kingham — who has bounced between the bullpen and the rotation this season — allowed three runs in 4 2/3 innings against Cincinnati on Monday. \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",
      " — Oregon State's Adley Rutschman, batting .420 and the likely No. 1 pick in next week's Major League Baseball draft, was intentionally walked with the bases loaded to pull the Beavers within 5-3 in the seventh inning. \n",

      " CINCINNATI — \n",
      " Tyler Mahle and the Cincinnati Reds offense finally got on the same page. \n",
      " Lack of run support had been costly for the Cincinnati right-hander through the first two months of the 2019 season. A 1-0 loss to the Mets at New York on May 2 was followed by a 2-0 loss at Oakland on May 7 while Mike Fiers was throwing a no-hitter. \n",
      " The Reds did erupt for six runs last Saturday at Wrigley Field, but Mahle tied his career high by allowing six earned runs over five innings in an 8-6 loss. \n",
      " »RELATED: ‘It’s gonna be weird’ \n",
      " In Friday’s opener of a three-game series against the Washington Nationals at Great American Ball Park, Mahle (2-5) matched a solid pitching performance with a prolific Cincinnati offense. He allowed five hits and three runs with two walks and eight strikeouts in five innings while the Reds were piling up 15 hits and nine runs with him on the mound. \n",
      " Curt Casali had three hits and drove in four runs, three with his second homer of the season, and Joey Votto also collected three hits as the Reds romped to a 9-3 win before 24,358 fans on “Star Wars” Night. \n",
      " “When you get support like that, you just want to throw a lot of strikes and get through the game,” said Mahle, who recorded his first career win over a National League East team. “You don’t have to be as careful.” \n",
      " The Reds scored at least eight runs for the third time in their last four games and fourth in their last six while snapping an eight-game losing streak against Washington at Great American Ball Park. Cincinnati hasn’t won a season series against the Nationals since 2015 and had lost 10 of their last 11 overall games against Washington. \n",
      " “We’re in synch,” Casali said. “Our pitching’s been great all season. We have a good lineup, and it was only a matter of time before we started hitting.” \n",
      " Nick Senzel, Jose Iglesias and Jose Peraza each had two hits and every Cincinnati starter except Mahle logged at least one hit. \n",
      " Much like the second game of Monday’s doubleheader, when the Reds sent 11 batters to the plate while scoring six runs in the first inning of Pittsburgh right-hander Mitch Keller’s major league debut, the Reds sent 10 batters to the plate and scored five runs against left-hander Patrick Corbin (5-3). Senzel and Votto hit his first two pitches for singles, Eugenio Suarez lined an RBI single to left, and Yasiel Puig hit a rocket off the left field wall so hard that Suarez could go only to second while Votto scored from second. \n",
      " Senzel extended his hitting streak to eight games with his sixth leadoff hit of the season. \n",
      " One out later, Casali blasted a shot halfway up the lower level of the first full section of seats down the left field line for a three-run homer and 5-0 lead – the second-most runs Corbin had allowed in any of his 12 starts. Cincinnati’s seven hits in the inning matched the most Corbin had allowed in any game this season. \n",
      " “Guys, that was a real pitcher,” he yelled after getting back to the dugout, according to Fox Sports Ohio’s Shannon Ford on Twitter. Casali’s only other homer this season came off Cubs’ infielder/catcher Victor Caratini on Sunday. \n",
      " “We got a good laugh out of that,” Casali said after the game. \n",
      " “That gave us a little breathing room,” manager David Bell said. “Mahle did everything he could to get us to the bullpen. It was a great start to the game against a tough pitcher. We came out aggressive. We were swinging at a lot of first pitches. The offense is gaining confidence and everybody is contributing.” \n",
      " Cincinnati’s seven first inning hits were the most of any single inning this season. \n",
      " “That was a great first inning,” Bell said. “It was really good offensive night for the entire team. It’s nice to see guys like Curt Casali and Kyle Farmer contribute. They’re doing a good job of staying ready. \n",
      " Votto’s hit snapped a tie with Brandon Phillips for eighth place on the Reds’ career hits list. Votto, who missed Cincinnati’s previous three games with a tight right hamstring, added another RBI single in Cincinnati’s three-run third inning and a third single in the fifth. He now has 1,777, seven behind Baseball Hall of Fame outfielder Edd Roush. \n",

      " The Giants averted a series sweep against the team with the National League's worst record, and won with six hits. They trailed 1-0 in the seventh when Crawford doubled and scored on a single by Mike Yastrzemski, who earned his first career RBI. \n",
      " With the score 1-all, Adam Conley (1-5) walked pinch hitter Buster Posey in the eighth. Brandon Belt followed with a broken-bat single, and Evan Longoria walked to load the bases. Crawford greeted Wei-Yin Chen with a ground-rule double for a 3-1 lead. \n",

      " CHAPEL HILL, N.C. – No. 23 Tennessee got off to a rough start in its NCAA Regional opener, falling 6-1 to Liberty on Friday night at Boshamer Stadium. \n",
      "  \n",
      " Due to a three-hour weather delay in the first game of the afternoon between North Carolina and UNC-Wilmington, the Vols game against Liberty did not start until 10 p.m., after originally being slated to begin at 7 p.m. \n",
      "  \n",
      " The Flames struggled on the mound during the early season meeting between the two programs, but Mason Meyer kept the UT bats quiet during the second contest. Meyer tossed 7.0 innings and allowed just one run on three hits before giving way to the bullpen to close out the game. \n",
      "  \n",
      " Tennessee starter  Garrett Stallings  did not have his best stuff, but still managed to throw 5.1 innings, allowing four runs (three earned) on 10 hits. Stallings struck out three batters on the night as well but dropped to 8-5 on the season after picking up the loss. \n",
      "  \n",
      " The Vols’ usually surehanded defense had a tough night as well, committing three errors that resulted in three unearned runs for Liberty. \n",
      "  \n",
      " The Flames opened the scoring with a two-run home run to right field by Jonathon Embry in the top of the first. Tyler Galazin doubled off the wall to bring in Logan Mathieu and extend Liberty’s advantage to three runs going into the fourth. \n",
      "  \n",
      " The Big Orange struggled offensively through the first three innings with junior  Justin Ammons  recording the Vols’ lone hit in that span with a leadoff single in the bottom of the first. Ammons saw his first action since sustaining an injury in the second game of the Ole Miss series on May 17. \n",
      "  \n",
      " After Liberty added two more runs in the top of the seventh to make it a 6-0 game,  Evan Russell  finally got the Vols on the board with a solo home run to left field in the bottom of the inning to break up the shutout. Russell finished the night 2-for-4 and was the only UT player with multiple hits in the game. \n",
      "  \n",
      " On the other hand, Liberty had four players record multi-hit performances, led by Brandon Rohrer, who finished the night 3-for-5 with a run and two RBI. Meyer improved to 6-4 on the year with the win. \n",

      " Phillies reportedly in talks to acquire Mariners’ veteran slugger Jay Bruce \n",
      " by Bob Brookover , Updated: June 1, 2019- 3:55 PM \n",
      " Seattle Mariners' Jay Bruce celebrates in the dugout after hitting a solo home run off Los Angeles Angels starting pitcher Tyler Skaggs during the seventh inning of a baseball game Friday, May 31, 2019, in Seattle. \n",
      " Stephen Brashear / AP \n",
      " LOS ANGELES -- The Phillies appear to be preparing for a roster without Odubel Herrera for a while. With the center fielder’s status in limbo as the team awaits a decision from Major League Baseball in regards to his Memorial Day simply assault arrest in Atlantic City, news surfaced via an ESPN tweet from Jeff Passan Saturday that the team is in talks with the Seattle Mariners about acquiring veteran slugger Jay Bruce. \n",
      " The Philadelphia Phillies are nearing a deal to acquire outfielder Jay Bruce from the Seattle Mariners, a club source familiar with the talks tells ESPN. The trade is expected to be finalized within the next 24 hours. \n",
      " — Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) June 1, 2019 \n",
      " Related stories \n",
      " Phillies lose to Cardinals, 5-3, as Jerad Eickhoff gives up three home runs \n",
      " A Phillies source confirmed the talks, but said no deal is imminent and that the team is also in discussions with other clubs about acquiring a left-handed bench bat. \n",
      " Bruce, 32, hit his 300th career home run Friday night against the Los Angeles Angels and he has 14 home runs this season for the Mariners. He is hitting just .212 overall with 35 hits in 165 at-bats, but 25 of his hits have been for extra bases. \n",
      " He has the ability to play first base as well as both corner outfield positions. Bruce has started 20 games in right field, six in left field and 15 at first base for the Mariners this season. He has also been their designated hitter three times. \n",
      " With Herrera possibly facing a suspension, the Phillies have a shortage of left-handed bats on their roster right now. The only two regulars that hit from the left side are right fielder Bryce Harper and switch-hitting second baseman Cesar Hernandez. Of course, it could be argued that even with Herrera that they had a shortage of quality left-handed bats. \n",
      " Herrera was hitting .222 with one home run and 12 extra-base hits before being placed on administrative leave by Major League Baseball Tuesday. His spot on the roster was filled by the left-handed hitting Nick Williams, who has been in a season-long slump that had led to his demotion to triple-A Lehigh Valley in the middle of May.

      " After starter Domingo Germán was chased early, six Yankee relievers combined for 5 1/3 scoreless innings to lock down another victory over the rival Red Sox — New York is 4-0 to start the season series, a first since 2012. \n",

      " Xander Bogaerts homered and had three hits for the Red Sox, who have lost 6 of 8 and fell 9 1/2 games behind New York for the AL East lead. That is Boston's biggest deficit in the division since finishing 15 games out in 2015. \n",

      " Abreu (Greeneville Astros 2015) goes seven in Thunder shutout \n",
      " (Michael Dill) \n",
      " By Chris Bumbaca / MiLB.com | June 1, 2019 12:30 PM \n",
      " Feel good, pitch good. It sounds simple, but it's the truth for Albert Abreu . \n",
      " In his longest outing of the season, the Yankees' third-ranked prospect fired seven scoreless innings. He allowed two hits and two walks, striking out six, as Double-A Trenton blanked Harrisburg, 2-0, on Friday at Arm & Hammer Park. \n",
      " \"He's been getting after it,\" Thunder pitching coach Tim Norton said. \"He's been ready for the first pitch of every inning, not easing into it, just kind of getting after it right from the get-go. He settled in and got in a good rhythm.\" \n",
      " Nationals No. 2 prospect Luis Garcia led off the game with a single to center field. From there, it was all Abreu (2-4). \n",
      " The native of the Dominican Republic didn't allow another hit until his final inning. After issuing a leadoff walk to Austin Davidson in the fourth, Abreu retired nine in a row. Nats No. 20 prospect Tres Barrera opened the seventh with a double off the wall in center, but the 23-year-old recorded three straight outs to strand Barrera at third and protect a 1-0 lead. \n",
      " Finding a way to pitch out of trouble in key spots is a vital step in his development. \n",
      " \"You're starting to see it coming out of him in big spots, making big pitches and limiting damage, which is huge,\" Norton said. \"Once in a while, you're going to have those big innings. He's getting closer and closer to consistently leave guys out there in big spots. He came off the mound fired up, and he should have been, tight game like that. It was huge.\" \n",
      " Abreu threw 55 of 84 pitches for strikes in his first scoreless start of the season. The two free passes were the fewest he's allowed since walking a pair against New Hampshire on April 24. In his previous two starts, the 6-foot-2 righty issued 10 free passes over 10 2/3 innings, including a six-walk outing on May 24 at Binghamton, where he surrendered a season-high six runs in five frames. \n",
      " \"He's put together a really good stretch the last six or seven games,\" Norton said. \"The last one was a dud, of course, with the walks and everything. But he's been in a great spot.\" \n",
      " Abreu has begun rounding into form this month. Prior to the Binghamton outing, he yielded five runs -- four earned -- over 24 2/3 innings in his previous four outings. \n",
      " Throwing the ball over the plate is always an emphasis, and Norton described Friday's performance \"a comeback start\" in that regard. \n",
      " \"Everything he has is good,\" the pitching coach said. \"He has a terrific arm, two plus off-speed pitches. They just need to show up more consistently, and they're starting to. He's not far away. It's just about being consistent. I know that's the everyday answer, but he has what it takes so that when he needs to make a pitch, he makes a pitch.\" \n",
      " Abreu lowered his ERA to 4.11 and has 43 strikeouts over 50 1/3 innings. On Friday, his 65-grade fastball reached 100 mph as late as the fourth inning and his curveball was particularly sharp. The uptick in velocity is something Norton has seen more of this season. His fastball sat typically in the mid-90s last year. \n",
      " \"He came to us with that [velocity],\" the pitching coach said. \"Like a lot of guys, it fluctuates over two to three years. \n",
      " \"I think his arm just feels better this year, and you're starting to see him sit at 97, 98 in some starts.\" \n",
      " Abreu's health also has improved. He had three separate stints on the injured list in 2018, when all but one of his non-rehab starts were with Class A Advanced Tampa. Certain pitchers, Norton said, pitch differently when their arm feels better. \n",
      " \"It might be for a few months, it might be for a year,\" he said. \"I think that's just kind of the life of a pitcher, where it just doesn't feel 100 percent for a pitcher. He's coming out of the gates every game getting after it, and it's coming out hot. I'm sure it feels a little better, overall.\" \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",

      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",

      " West Virginia's Brandon White (7) and Tevin Tucker (2) celebrate after closing out an inning against Fordham during an NCAA college baseball regional tournament Friday, May 31, 2019, in Morgantown, W.V. (William Wotring/The Dominion-Post via AP) \n",
      " Save \n",
      " GRANVILLE, W.Va. – The record-breaking crowd that piled into the seats at Monongalia County Ballpark were on the edge of them most of the night. \n",
      " In the bottom of the third inning, when the West Virginia University baseball team showed its first sign of life as a long-awaited host, that same crowd shared the same urgency of the Mountaineers. They stood similar to the fans that crowded the fence high above the first-base line, the ones on the grass hillside beyond the Fordham dugout and those that settled for folding chairs overlooking the ballpark without having to pay for tickets. \n",
      " As their wildness grew, so did that of Fordham’s sophomore starting pitcher John Stankiewicz. \n",
      " Rattling the Atlantic 10 Conference Co-Pitcher of the Year, top-seeded West Virginia scored three runs in a raucous third inning and went on to defeat No. 4-seed Fordham, 6-2, in the Mountaineers’ first game as the host for the NCAA Baseball Regional in 64 years before 4,355 fans Friday night. \n",
      " “Great win,” West Virginia coach Randy Mazey said. “That’s a stadium full of energy tonight from the first pitch to the last. When you have that much energy in the stadium, you are exhausted when it’s over. I know I’m exhausted. I can’t imagine how these guys feel. That was a dogfight.” \n",
      " The win advances West Virginia (38-20) to a winners’ bracket game at 7 p.m. Saturday against Duke, which defeated Texas A&M in the opener Friday afternoon, 8-5. Fordham (38-23) drops to an elimination game against the Aggies at 2 p.m. today. \n",
      " The danger of a leadoff single by West Virginia’s TJ Lake looked to be behind Stankiewicz after Lake was caught stealing for the first out in the third. That’s when the real problems began for the pitcher who began the year as a reliever. \n",
      " Stankiewicz walked No. 9 hitter Tevin Tucker. Tyler Doanes singled through the left side of the infield. One batter later, a wild pitch that handcuffed Rams catcher Justin Bardwell allowed Tucker to race from second all the way to home and tie the game at 1-1. The Mountaineers then took the lead when Doanes high-stepped across home plate on a deep sacrifice fly to right centerfield by Darius Hill. Walks to the next two batters, including a bases-loaded free pass to Ivan Gonzalez, gave West Virginia a 3-1 lead. \n",
      " “When (Brandon White) was up there with a full count, that’s as loud as I’ve ever heard this stadium,” Mazey said. “That’s not easy to pitch under those circumstances. I’ve been telling our fans the whole season, don’t just come and watch, come and help. I really think they helped us win that game because it’s not easy to throw a strike with 4,300 people yelling at you.” \n",
      " Stankiewicz was pulled before the inning ended, marking it his shortest outing since making his first collegiate start against North Florida on Feb. 24. \n",
      " “He doesn’t get rattled too much. I don’t think he was rattled,” Fordham coach Kevin Leighton said. “He has thrown a lot for us this year. I think a few calls didn’t go his way, at least from my angle. You are then working counts that are more hitter friendly. He just couldn’t command his offspeed stuff the way he normally has throughout the year and it got him in trouble. \n",
      " West Virginia extended its lead in the sixth and seventh inning with a pair of doubles. Doanes hit a sinking line drive to right centerfield to score a pair of runs to give the Mountaineers a 5-1 lead in the sixth. Gonzalez doubled to the game gap an inning later for another run. \n",
      " Playing in its first NCAA tournament in 21 years, Fordham got off to a fast start. The Rams opened the scoring when Matt Tarabek hit a run-scoring single under the diving glove of Doanes at second base to score Jake MacKenzie for a 1-0 lead. \n",
      " Fordham prevented an earlier Mountaineers’ rally with its defense in the second inning. Billy Godrick crashed into the final zero of the 400-foot sign in straightaway centerfield to rob Paul McIntosh of extra bases. Second baseman C.J. Vazquez made a leaping catch on a line-drive behind the second-base bag for another out and Stankewicz knocked down a line drive and threw onto first to end the inning. \n",
      " West Virginia pitcher Nick Snyder remained undefeated as a starter on the season. Snyder, who only pitched four innings in a relief role all of last season, is 9-0 in games he has started this year. He went five innings, gave up four hits, one run and struck out six, lowering his ERA to 2.65 in 68 innings. \n",
      " Duke 8, Texas A&M 5: \n",
      " Erikson Nichols and Rudy Maxwell each hit three-run home runs to power third-seeded Duke over No. 2-seed Texas A&M, 8-5, in the regional opener. \n",
      " Nichols broke a scoreless tie in the top of the fourth inning with a towering shot to left field to give the Blue Devils a 3-0 lead. Maxwell, who entered the game as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning, also sent the second pitch he saw well over the left-field wall. \n",
      " The two home runs for Duke (32-25) ignited a pair of four-run innings to support starting pitcher Ben Gross. \n",
      " Gross surrendered his lone run on a sacrifice fly by Texas A&M’s Braden Shewmake to left field in the fifth, cutting the Aggies’ deficit to 4-1. He scattered four hits and struck out five over seven innings to earn the win. \n",
      " The middle of Duke’s lineup caused problems for Aggies’ pitchers. The No. 4 through No. 7 hitters for the Blue Devils had 10 of their 11 hits. Kyle Gallagher and Nichols each had three hits. \n",
      " Texas A&M (37-22-1) scored four runs and sent the tying run to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning but its rally fell short. \n",
      " The Aggies swept a three-game series against Fordham to open the season in mid-February. \n",

      " e-mail \n",
      " Eddie Rosario hit a two-run bases-loaded single in the ninth inning to break a 3-3 tie and give the Minnesota Twins a 5-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday night in St. Petersburg, Fla. \n",
      " The Twins had filled the bases without a hit off reliever Diego Castillo (1-4), who hit both Jonathan Schoop and Willians Astudillo while also intentionally walking Jorge Polanco. Adam Kolarek replaced Castillo and Rosario then grounded a ball down the third base line to drive in both Schoop and Polanco. \n",
      " Polanco scored three runs and had two doubles and a RBI and Astudillo had a pair of RBI singles for Minnesota, which improved to 15-3 following a loss. Schoop finished 2-for-2 with two runs scored and Marwin Gonzalez also had two hits for the Twins. \n",
      " Taylor Rogers (2-1) picked up the win with 2 1/3 innings of one-hit relief. \n",
      " Kevin Kiermaier hit a two-run homer and Austin Meadows stole home for Tampa Bay, which had a season-best six-game winning streak snapped. Willy Adames added two hits. \n",
      " Minnesota took a 1-0 lead in the first inning when Polanco, who sat out Thursday night's 14-3 loss to the Rays with a virus, slammed a double off the wall in right-center and then scored on a single by Astudillo. The Twins nearly made it 3-0 when C.J. Cron came within a foot of a home run with a drive off the top of the right field fence. Cron ended up with a double and Astudillo, who paused briefly after turning third, was then cut down at the plate by Kiermaier. \n",
      " Tampa Bay took a 2-1 lead in the second on Kiermaier's sixth home run of the season, a 414-foot drive over the center field fence, driving in Christian Arroyo after a one-out walk. \n",
      " The Rays made it 3-1 in the third when Meadows, who led off with a walk and went to third one out later on a single by Adames, stole home on a delayed double steal. It was the 12th steal of home in Rays' history. \n",
      " Minnesota tied it 3-3 in the fifth when Schoop walked, advanced to second on a groundout by Max Kepler and then scored on a double into the gap in left-center by Polanco. Astudillo then followed with a single to drive in Polanco. \n",
      " The Twins nearly took a 5-3 lead in the eighth when Miguel Sano hit a towering drive down the left field line that likely would have been a two-run homer, except it caromed off a speaker and back to Adames in shallow left field for an out. \n",

      " In Frederick, Maryland, the Lynchburg Hillcats squandered scoring opportunities in a pair of games Friday, leaving the bases loaded in the final inning of a 5-1 loss in the early contest and stranding 10 runners in a 3-0 loss in the nightcap at Nymeo Field. \n",
      " In Game 1, Lynchburg managed just two hits but had a chance at a comeback when three runners reached on a pair of walks and a hit by pitch. Keys reliever Diogenes Almengo, though, escaped by getting Nolan Jones to ground out to end the game. \n",
      " The Hillcats’ lone run came on a bases-loaded walk in the third. \n",
      " Frederick (27-25) got on the board first with a single in the first inning, and Cole Billingsley recorded an RBI double in the second. Lynchburg responded by scoring its run in the next frame to cut it to 2-1, but Frederick scored three unanswered on a pair of homers from J.C. Escarra and Zach Jarrett. \n",
      " Billingsley alone outhit the Hillcats (26-26) by going 4 for 4. Frederick tallied 11 hits, with eight of them coming against Lynchburg starter Justin Garza (3-4), who took the loss. \n",
      " Garza tossed five innings in the seven-inning game and allowed three runs (all earned), walked three and struck out five. \n",
      " Frederick starter DL Hall (2-2) earned the win, allowing one run (earned) on two hits in five innings. He walked three and fanned six. Almengo picked up his sixth save. \n",

      " Jonathan Laureano went 3 for 3 to lead Lynchburg, while six players had a hit each for Frederick. \n",

      " The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage for May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). They went 8-18 in May 1980. \n",

      " By Associated Press&nbsp|&nbsp \n",
      " Posted: Sat 12:15 AM, Jun 01, 2019 \n",
      " ATLANTA, Ga. Niko Goodrum homered twice and had a career-high five hits, Nicholas Castellanos and Grayson Greiner also went deep, and the Detroit Tigers romped to an 8-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Friday night. \n",
      " Spencer Turnbull pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just five hits and one earned run in dealing the Braves their third straight loss at SunTrust Park. \n",
      " Goodrum, who came into the night hitting just .208, launched a 419-foot drive that nearly went into the Chop House restaurant above the right-field seats in the third inning. He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. \n",
      " Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",
      " Greiner homered in the second, and Castellanos added a two-run shot that capped a fifth that was sparked by JaCoby Jones' leadoff triple. He got his left foot to the bag just ahead of Josh Donaldson's tag on the knee - a call that was challenged by the Braves but upheld after a video review. \n",
      " Buck Farmer came on in the seventh when the Braves loaded the bases against Turnbull (3-4) with no outs. Atlanta got a run on Brian McCann's sacrifice fly and reloaded the bases when Ozzie Albies reached on an infield single that deflected off Farmer's glove. But the Tigers reliever escaped the jam when pinch hitter Charlie Culberson grounded into an inning-ending double play. \n",
      " After two straight strong starts, Atlanta's Mike Foltynewicz (1-4) had another rough night. His slider was dominating at times - he struck out eight - but too many mistakes up in the zone doomed the right-hander. \n",

      " Braves: OF Ender Inciarte isn't close to returning to the active roster. \"He hasn't started his baseball stuff yet,\" manager Brian Snitker said. \"He needs to come in a few days in a row feeling pretty good, amp up his running and things like that before we see him swinging a bat.\" Inciarte has been on the injured list since May 15 with a lumbar strain. ... Snitker also doused any hope that RHP Darren O'Day (forearm strain) might be getting close to bolstering the beleaguered Atlanta bullpen. \"He hasn't even thrown off the mound yet,\" the manager said. \"He's a ways away.\" \n",

      " Dodgers power up to beat Phillies, end May with a bang \n",
      " By Jorge Castillo Los Angeles Times (TNS) \n",
      " 7 hrs ago \n",
      " LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded the month of May on Friday how they spent most of its first 30 days: pounding baseballs and riding a quality start to victory. In Friday’s 6-3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies, it was Kenta Maeda delivering a stout six-inning performance while the offense scored its runs on four homers from four different power sources in front of an announced sellout crowd of 54,307 at Dodger Stadium — the largest in the regular season since 2012 — for the club’s annual LGBT night. \n",
      " Maeda surrendered two runs on three hits, didn’t walk a batter, plunked one, and tallied six strikeouts over six innings before exiting with 88 pitches. The outing completed an exceptional month of starting pitching for the Dodgers (39-19). The group led the majors in earned-run average (2.50), WHIP (0.93), innings per start (6.36), and strikeout-to-walk ratio (7.41) in 26 games. They logged at least six innings in 22 games, walked more than two batters once, and allowed fewer than three runs 15 times. \n",
      " The performances fueled a 19-7 month for the Dodgers, one they completed without losing consecutive games while posting four winning streaks of at least three games. They enter June with an 81/2-game lead over the second-place San Diego Padres in the National League West. \n",
      " The Dodgers, who were without manager Dave Roberts as he attended his son’s high school graduation, loaded their lineup with six left-handed hitters — all populating the top six spots — with reason: Left-handed batters entered Friday performing at an all-star level against Phillies starter Jake Arrieta. While right-handed hitters were batting .230 with a .598 on-base-plus-slugging percentage against him, those in the opposite batter’s box had compiled a .283 batting average and .865 OPS. Six of the nine home runs Arrieta allowed this season were against left-handed hitters. That total quickly increased Friday. \n",
      " After Joc Pederson, the Dodgers’ leadoff man, reached on an infield single, Max Muncy opened the scoring in the third inning by lashing a slider over the right-field fence for a two-run home run. Two innings later, Pederson smashed his 17th home run — a 445-foot leadoff blast to the back of the right-field pavilion. Muncy followed with a single before Corey Seager launched his seventh home run. \n",
      " The blows knocked Arrieta out after five innings. He gave up five runs on 10 hits, threw 97 pitches, and forced the Phillies bullpen to deal with the Dodgers’ unyielding offense for four innings. Enrique Hernandez added a 432-foot moonshot in the eighth inning off Juan Nicasio to complete the Dodgers’ power display. \n",
      " Maeda did not break a sweat the first time through the Phillies’ order. He retired the nine batters in order and punched out five of them. He threw 38 pitches, including 15 sliders, and generated 11 swing-and-misses. \n",
      " His continued heavy slider usage spawned rougher waters to begin his second time through the lineup. He threw three straight sliders to Andrew McCutchen, the Phillies’ leadoff hitter, to start the fourth inning. The third offering, a meaty 82-mph slider, was walloped over the wall in straightaway center field to soil the perfect game, no-hitter, and shutout with one swat. \n",
      " Another hanging slider — and a defensive hiccup behind him — hurt Maeda in the fifth inning. With two on and one out, Maeda got Nick Williams to hit a groundball to first baseman Matt Beaty, who fired the ball to second base in an attempt to start an inning-ending double play. But his off-balanced throw to shortstop Seager bounced, not giving Seager enough time to finish it off. So Williams reached base, giving Arrieta the chance to crack a slider to left field to tie the game for the Phillies (33-24). \n",
      " Maeda limited the damage there, capping a month of dominance for the Dodgers’ starting rotation. \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",

      " NEW YORK -  (AP) -- DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay -- and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",

      " PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",

      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs -- one shy of his career high -- in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",

      " It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. \n",
      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",
      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",

      " Domingo German now has had two cracks at becoming MLB’s first 10-game winner this season, and each time he has delivered a step-back dud. \n",
      " German wasn’t exactly clobbered the way he had been in Kansas City in his previous start, but he was pulled Saturday night in the fourth inning of the Yankees’ 5-3 win over the Red Sox at the Stadium. \n",
      " German, who opened the season 9-1 with a 2.60 ERA as a rotation fill-in for injured ace Luis Severino, needed 87 pitches to record 11 outs before departing a 3-3 game with two outs in the fourth. With 10 earned runs allowed in his past two starts, German’s ERA has ballooned by more than a full run to 3.66. \n",
      " The Royals had hit four homers and scored seven earned runs in five innings against German in another no-decision last Sunday, but Aaron Boone said before Saturday’s start, “I still feel like he’s throwing the ball really well.” \n",
      " The manager also didn’t believe the 26-year-old righthander’s confidence was shaken by what easily was his rockiest outing of the season. \n",
      " “No, because I think he understands how good he is and still can be,” Boone said before the game. “And I think the ability, he knows he’s got three pitches that he can strike in any count, three above-average major league pitches that he can strike in any count. I think that gives him comfort. And I expect him to go out against a very tough lineup and if he makes his pitches, he has a chance to have real success.” \n",
      " German struck out Andrew Benintendi and Rafael Devers on curveballs in the first inning and fanned three more despite surrendering a run on three singles in the second. \n",
      " After the Yankees gave him a 3-1 lead with five singles in the bottom half, German whiffed Benintendi and Devers again in the third for seven strikeouts through three innings (of his eight overall).  \n",

      " But Xander Bogaerts tagged German’s hanging changeup for a solo homer to left in the fourth, an inning he would not survive. Brock Holt followed Bogaerts’ blast with a single and scored later in the inning on Sandy Leon’s full-count single to center to tie it. Reliever Chad Green replaced German and recorded the final out of the frame to maintain the tie. \n",
      " German’s recent shakiness only underscores the likelihood that the first-place Yankees will seek to upgrade their starting rotation ahead of the July 31 trade deadline. Free agent Dallas Keuchel remains unsigned and Madison Bumgarner — a proven postseason performer — and others figure to be available on the trade market. \n",
      " Severino, a 19-game winner in 2018, hasn’t made a start this season because of rotator cuff inflammation in his right shoulder and a lat injury, and lefties James Paxton and CC Sabathia also have spent time on the injured list. Paxton (knee) returned from the injured list with four shutout innings Wednesday against San Diego; Sabathia (knee) is slated to be activated to start the series finale against Boston on Sunday night. \n",

      " BATON ROUGE. – With his third hit of the night, senior outfielder Antoine Duplantis tied Eddy Furniss for the LSU career hits record with 352 hits as the LSU baseball team stormed pat Stony Brook, 17-3 in the opening round of the Baton Rouge Regional Friday night in Alex Box Stadium, Skip Bertman Field. \n",
      " For the eighth consecutive year, LSU has won its regional opener. The 14-run win is the largest margin of victory in a regional opener since the Tigers opened the 2000 regional opener with a 19-1 win against Jackson State and is the fifth double-digit regional opening victory since 1996 (’97, ’98, ’00, ’08, ’19). \n",
      " LSU will meet Southern Miss at 6 p.m. CT Saturday in The Box. TV for the game is TBD, and fans can listen to the game on the LSU Sports Radio Network, including 98.1 FM in Baton Rouge. \n",
      " Freshman Landon Marceaux improved to 5-2 on the season after throwing only 53 pitches in five innings. He limited Stony Brook to two runs—one earned—on seven hits, walked one and struck out three. \n",
      " Ma’Khail Hilliard was the first Tiger out of the bullpen and he allowed one run on one hit and struck out two in the sixth. Trent Vietmeier made his first appearance back on the mound since May 10 at Arkansas. He, Chase Costello and Rye Gunter combined for the final three innings, blanking the Seawolves after allowing two hits and striking out three. \n",
      " Right-hander Greg Marino suffered the loss and fell to 5-5 after allowing seven runs—two earned—on three hits, walked three and struck out two in 1.1 innings. \n",
      " Stony Brook was first on the board in the top of the first inning. First baseman Chris Hamilton singled through the left side and moved to second on a wild pitch before scoring on an error by the shortstop. \n",
      " The Tigers erupted for five runs on two hits and one error in the bottom of the inning to make it a 5-1 game. With the bases loaded and two outs, first baseman Chris Reid drew a walk before catcher Saul Garza cleared the bases with a double down the right field line. Second baseman followed with a RBI single to center field to round out the five-run first inning. \n",
      " In the bottom of the second inning with shortstop Josh Smith on second base after a single and a stolen base, Duplantis slapped an RBI single up the middle. With runners in scoring position after a base hit by left fielder Daniel Cabrera, designated hitter Cade Beloso hit a sacrifice fly to left field to bring in Duplantis. Center fielder Zach Watson then hit a moon shot to left field for his sixth home run of the year, a two-run blast, to put the Tigers up 9-1. \n",
      " Duplantis drove in two runs in the bottom of the third with his single through the right side to extend the LSU lead to 11-1. \n",
      " With runners on first and second in the fourth, second baseman Brandt Broussard unloaded his first career home run to right field to put LSU up 13-1. \n",
      " In the top of the fifth inning, center fielder Michael Wilson drove in second baseman Brandon Janofsky on a fielder’s choice. \n",
      " With the bases in the fifth inning, Watson was hit by a pitch, Reid hit a sacrifice fly and Garza reached on a fielding error, which resulted in three runs for the Tigers to make it a 17-2 game. \n",
      " The Seawolves finalized the score at 17-3 when left fielder Dylan Resk homered to left field to open the sixth inning. \n",

      " Brandon Belt drove in four runs, Buster Posey homered and the San Francisco Giants used a rare offensive outburst to breeze past the Baltimore Orioles 8-2 on Saturday. \n",
      " San Francisco built a 7-1 lead in the fifth inning and cruised to only its second win in 10 games. The Giants came in ranked last in the NL with a .221 batting average and had scored as many as seven runs only once in their previous 19 games. \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski scored twice and had an RBI for the Giants, who made it easy for rookie right-hander Shaun Anderson to earn his first major league victory. \n",
      " Anderson (1-1) allowed two runs and five hits over seven innings in his fourth big league start. Anderson ended a run of 40 consecutive starts of fewer than seven innings by Giants pitchers — the team's longest such streak in the last 100 years. \n",

      " Obtained in a 2017 trade that sent Eduardo Núñez to Boston, the 24-year-old Anderson pitched in seven games at the Triple-A level this year before making his debut with San Francisco on May 15 against Toronto. His previous three starts with the Giants each were five innings. \n",
      " San Francisco scored all its runs off David Hess (1-7). Since throwing 6 1/3 innings of no-hit ball in Toronto on April 1, Hess has gone 0-7 over 10 starts. \n",
      " Belt had a two-run single in the first inning and doubled in two runs during a four-run fifth. Posey ended a run of 50 at-bats without a homer by going deep to right in the third. \n",
      " Renato Núñez hit his 15th home run for Baltimore, the eighth in 12 games. \n",

      " Dwight Smith Jr.'s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",

      " \"It's been a rough couple of months,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We've had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.\" \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " \"A great day by the kid,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.\" \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",

      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz's ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn't allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " \"It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,\" Cashner said. \"I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.\" \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",

      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year's Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J.

      " NEW YORK (AP) — DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",

      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",

He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August.

Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",

      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",

He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",

      " Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases.

But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A's their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. \n",

      " By Aaron Carney | For NJ Advance Media \n",
      " on  May 31, 2019 10:20 PM, updated  June 01, 2019 1:35 AM \n",
      " Complete Box Score » \n",
      " The 2019 edition of the NJSIAA South Jersey, Group 1 baseball final was a tale of two teams. \n",
      " The first tale was about the Glassboro Bulldogs, and how a 13-0 victory on their home turf allowed them to secure not only their winningest season in the history of the program with 22 wins, but also their first sectional championship in team history. \n",
      " The second tale was about their opponent, the Schalick Cougars, and how everything that could have possibly gone wrong for a three seed playing in a road championship game did just that. \n",
      " For Glassboro (22-5), momentum shifted their direction in a huge way following a three-run home run by junior centerfielder Noah Putney. After two straight strikeouts with the bases loaded to end the first inning, Putney's bomb to centerfield broke the tie and was immediately followed by an RBI single by senior catcher Coty McArthur. After two innings, the Bulldogs were up 4-0. \n",
      " \"He threw the curveball first pitch and I knew it was coming,\" Putney said of the hit. \"So I just sat back on it and let it do what it did and that really got us going early.\" \n",
      " Then in the fourth inning, the Glassboro offense erupted for a total of nine runs scored by eight different players on six hits, lead by senior shortstop Santino Mancini at the top of the lineup. Mancini had two singles, two RBI and two runs scored in the half inning, while Putney and McArthur had a pair of two-RBI doubles and a run scored each. \n",
      " \"Everyone was just getting their pitch, staying off the curve, staying straight on the fastball and putting it in play,\" said Mancini. \n",
      " With the score 13-0 heading into the top of the fifth, Bulldogs pitcher Justin Tongue knew he was just three outs away from a championship via the 10-run rule. After a leadoff single, the junior starter struck out the next two batters he faced and caught a line drive right back at him for the final out of the game. He finished with a complete game (five innings) shut out with three hits, two walks and six strikeouts. \n",
      " \"My mindset was to come in and have the best pitching performance of my life,\" Tongue said. \"And I would say this was definitely one of the best performances of my life.\" \n",
      " \"There was nobody else I was going to give the ball to today,\" added Glassboro head coach Don Brown. \"Everybody knows he's our ace, he's earned it, and he delivered for us today.\" \n",
      " On the other side of the diamond, the Cougars (17-6) were on their heels from the get go. \n",
      " Sophomore pitcher Sam Long found himself in a bases-loaded jam in the first inning after a fumbled catch at first base and a throw from third to first that hit the middle umpire. While Long was able to escape with all three runners left stranded, the miscues for Schalick appeared to stick in their heads. \n",
      " Once Long escaped the second inning with two runners stranded after allowing four earned, the defense bounced right back with a 1-2-3 third inning. Then the fourth inning came, and the Cougars loaded the bases after a wild pitch strike three, but all were left stranded. \n",
      " When Glassboro came back up, two hits and two walks (one fielder's choice at third) loaded the bases for McArthur's two-run double. At that point, Schalick coach Sean O'Brien decided a pitching change was in order and called senior Jacob McCaffrey to the bag from his spot at first base. \n",
      " With limited warmup time, McCaffrey could only hope to put the ball in play and unfortunately for Schalick that wasn't enough. A string of miscues allowed the Bulldogs to build what turned out to be an insurmountable lead. \n",
      " To top it all off for Schalick, star senior catcher Staus Pokrovsky's final plate appearance ended up as the last out of the game, as his line drive shot was snagged by Tongue on the mound. \n",
      " \"I feel like we were relaxed coming in, but we had it in the back of our minds that we already lost twice (to Glassboro) and we really just didn’t hit the ball well,\" McCaffrey said. \n",
      " Glassboro will advance to the Group 1 semifinals to face Middlesex, the Central Jersey sectional champion, on Monday at Rider University. \n",
      " Glassboro has no intentions on slowing down. Now that they've crossed sectional champions off their list, the Bulldogs are ready to see just how far they can take this thing. \n",
      " \"We're confident. We're not going to back down from anything,\" said Brown. \"It's uncharted waters for us, but it's also welcome waters and I know these guys are hungry and they'll be ready to go on Monday.\" \n",

      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Tanner Roark's first career homer wasn't enough to get the win against his former Nationals teammates. Instead, it went to the other half of the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " \"A weird day,\" Nationals starter Eric Fedde said. \n",
      " Except for the outcome. Nothing surprising about the Nationals winning in Cincinnati. \n",
      " Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Nationals to a 5-2 victory — their ninth in 10 games at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason for Tanner Rainey. Both pitchers came away with a career moment. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Fedde, his first in 336 career plate appearances. \n",
      " \"I felt like my emotions were under control,\" said Roark, who went six innings. \"It's definitely a tough loss. The bunt and the home run felt good. I would've rather have won the game.\" \n",
      " Sports Videos \n",
      " Two homers made the difference. \n",
      " Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 36 2/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Rainey (1-1), who got into the game in the fifth. He acknowledged that he had extra motivation facing his former team, and he fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. \n",
      " \"For me getting the first win in here, it is special,\" Rainey said. \n",
      " Rainey fanned Yasiel Puig with a runner on third to end the fifth inning, and then struck out two more batters in the sixth. \n",
      " \"He's going to be a good one, he really is,\" manager Dave Martinez said. \"He has that look when he comes out of the bullpen that I really like,\" \n",
      " Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Washington's Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. It was the longest hitting streak by a player under age 21 since Manny Machado also hit in 14 straight games in 2013. \n",
      " DOMINATION \n",
      " The Nationals are 17-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " DOUBLE TROUBLE \n",
      " The Reds hit into double plays in the first, third and fifth innings, helping Fedde escape trouble. \n",
      " \"That's the best I could have hoped for,\" said Fedde, who gave up six hits and three walks in four-plus innings. \"That's when the ground ball really comes into play. That saved me today.\" \n",
      " STREAKS \n",
      " Washington's Anthony Rendon has reached base in 18 consecutive games, going 22 for 64 with six doubles, two triples, four homers and 16 walks. Cincinnati's Nick Senzel doubled, extending his streak to nine games, the longest by a Red this season. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Nationals: Reliever Trevor Rosenthal threw 29 pitches in the bullpen Saturday without problem and is expected to start a rehab assignment on Tuesday. He's been sidelined by a viral infection since April 26. \n",
      " Reds: Joey Votto was in the starting lineup for the second straight game after missing three with hamstring tightness. Votto returned Friday, had three hits during a 9-3 win, and left after five innings as a precaution. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Nationals: Max Scherzer (2-5) has no-decisions in his last two starts despite allowing one run and 11 hits in 12 innings. \n",
      " Reds: Sonny Gray (2-4) has won his last two starts, allowing one run and 10 hits in 12 innings. \n",

      " 8 hrs ago \n",
      " PHOENIX — Decidedly unclutch for most of Friday night, the New York Mets used a change in luck to change the game, rallying in the eighth for a 5-4 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. \n",
      " The Mets entered the penultimate inning just 2-for-12 with runners in scoring position, out-hitting Arizona except for when it mattered most. Then, with two outs, came the good fortune: a single by Todd Frazier on an off-balance swing, a soft single by Adeiny Hechavarria poked down the rightfield line, and an infield single by J.D. Davis that looked like a routine inning-ending groundout until reliever Matt Andriese reached for it with his glove. That tied the score at 4-4. \n",
      " Pinch hitter Carlos Gomez put the Mets ahead for good with an RBI double ripped barely fair down the third-base line. Because plate umpire Jim Wolf had left the game in the second after Frazier’s foul tip hit his mask (which fell off his face), there was no third-base umpire available to rule fair or foul, and because the ballboy down the leftfield line thought it was foul, he picked up a ball that was in play. \n",
      " That took a while to sort out. Davis was placed at third and Gomez at second, but the game-deciding play required at least three conversations to confirm: the umpires with Arizona manager Torey Lovullo, the umpires with Mets manager Mickey Callaway and the umpires with MLB’s replay headquarters in New York City. After several minutes of uncertainty, the call was upheld. \n",
      " Callaway opted for an unusual late-inning combo to finish it off. Seth Lugo, on his first day back from the injured list, pitched around a scoreless eighth, getting two pop-ups to work around Gomez’s misplay of a fly ball into a triple. Robert Gsellman, filling in for Edwin Diaz, tossed the ninth for the save. Gsellman snapped a streak of four consecutive appearances in which he allowed at least one run. \n",
      " For the Mets (28-29), that made a winner out of Zack Wheeler (4.68 ERA), who allowed four runs in seven innings. \n",
      " He cruised until the sixth, when Ketel Marte and Christian Walker homered. The former was a fly ball to right, the latter a scorched line drive — 110.4 mph, 447 feet — to left. \n",
      " Including those dingers, Wheeler has allowed nine in 77 innings this season, accounting for more than one-third of his total earned runs allowed. Last year, he allowed 14 homers in 182 1/3 innings. \n",
      " In his first major-league start, Diamondbacks righthander Jon Duplantier, 24, one of the club’s top prospects, allowed three runs in five innings. He stumbled only in the second, when Frazier (RBI single) and Hechavarria (two-run double off the centerfield wall) accounted for the Mets’ only runs against him. \n",
      " Duplantier rebounded by retiring 12 of his next 14 batters to finish his outing. \n",
      " Hechavarria’s continued production — especially of the extra-base variety — runs contrary to his career norms but comes at an important time for the Mets. Filling in for Robinson Cano, who is out with a strained left quadriceps, Hechavarria is up to three homers and 12 RBIs in 44 plate appearances. Cano, who has struggled to hit when healthy, is at three homers and 13 RBIs in 181 plate appearances. \n",

      " Clemson's Michael Green (11) is congratulated by teammate Logan Davidson (8) after hitting a home run against Illinois at the NCAA college baseball regional tournament, Friday, May 31, 2019, in Oxford, Miss. \n",
      " Bruce Newman \n",
      " Sharpe, big innings, key Clemson's win over Illinois in NCAA Tournament \n",
      " Clemson coach Monte Lee knew eventually that the Tigers' bullpen would play a key role this weekend during the NCAA's Oxford Regional. \n",
      " What Lee probably didn’t know was that the bullpen would come through so soon. \n",
      " Kyle Wilkie had a career-high four hits and drove in three runs and Davis Sharpe pitched the final 62/3 innings in his first career relief appearance to lead Clemson to an 8-4 victory over Illinois in the opening game of the Oxford Regional at Swayze Field in Oxford, Miss., on Friday afternoon. \n",
      " The Tigers (35-24) will take on the winner of the Mississippi-Jacksonville State on Saturday at 7 p.m. in the winners’ bracket. The Fighting Illini dropped to 36-20. \n",
      " Before leaving for Mississippi, Lee said he wouldn’t hesitate going to his bullpen in Game 1 of the regional if the situation warranted it. \n",
      " “Winning that first game is so important in a regional, so I'm going to do whatever is necessary to win that first game,” Lee said earlier in the week. \n",
      " With starter Jacob Hennessey struggling at the start of the game, Lee quickly called upon Davis, who had started 14 games for the Tigers this season. \n",
      " “In Game 1 of a regional, you have to do things like that in a tight ball game to win it,” Lee said. “You have to seize the moment, whether that’s at the plate or on the mound, you have to seize the moment. I felt like we were the better team at seizing the moment with Davis on the mound. Illinois did an outstanding squaring up Hennessy, so we had to go to Davis.\" \n",
      " Sharpe (7-4) used a mixture of fastballs, changeups and curveballs to keep the Illinois off balance and earn the win, giving up three hits, one run, while striking out three batters. \n",
      " “I was just pounding the strike zone,” Davis said. “I was using my fastball and changeup in the first three innings, and then I finally found my curveball. It was a three-pitch mix for the last three innings. My fastball was moving like usual and I trusted my defense - they made some great plays behind me.” \n",
      " In the top of the first inning, Wilkie ripped a two-out, run-scoring single to give the Tigers a 1-0 lead. \n",
      " Zac Taylor responded with an RBI groundout in the bottom of the first, and Branden Comia laced a two-out, run-scoring single in the second inning as the Illini grabbed a 2-1 lead. \n",
      " Michael Green led off the top of the third inning with his third home run of the season to extend his hitting streak to 12 games, then Grayson Byrd blasted a two-run homer, his 16th of the season and 11th in the last 16 games. Illinois plated a run in the bottom of the third inning on Cam McDonald's single to narrow Clemson's lead to 4-3. \n",
      " “We talked all season about responding and they’d gotten a couple of runs, so it was big for Mike to hit that home run to tie it back up,” Byrd said. “I’m up there and just trying to put a good swing on a pitch and I thought it was going foul, I think the wind kind of kept it in, but I’ll take it.” \n",
      " In the seventh inning, the Tigers loaded the bases with no outs, then Wilkie hit a two-run single. Later in the frame, Byrd scored on a fielder's choice. Clemson added a run in the eighth inning on Byrd's third hit of the game. \n",
      " “Michael Green has been on fire in the last 10 or 12 games, ever since he’s been back in our lineup,” Lee said. “Byrd has been the best hitter in the country over the last 15 games. When you’re getting the kind of production we got one through four in the lineup, you are going to score runs.” \n",
      " Using just two pitchers could be a key for the Tigers as the regional continues. \n",
      " “David Sharpe was outstanding coming out of the bullpen, maybe a little earlier than we would have liked too, but we felt like at that time it was the right time,” Lee said. “We felt like offensively we were in good shape and we were going to score some runs today. We were able to stretch Davis out and not use anyone else in our bullpen. We played great defensively, had a huge double play in the middle innings to get us off the field and overall, just a great game.” \n",

      " NEW YORK (AP) — DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",
      " Rafael Devers homered early for the third-place Red Sox, who fell 8½ games back in the division. That's the furthest they've been behind the Yankees since finishing the 2015 season nine games in the dust. \n",
      " PIRATES 9, BREWERS 4 \n",
      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",
      " REDS 9, NATIONALS 3 \n",
      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",
      " Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto's 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. \n",

      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking, two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and Minnesota beat Tampa Bay in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",

      " DENVER (AP) — Trevor Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and the Colorado Rockies beat the slumping Toronto Blue Jays for their sixth straight win. \n",
      " It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. \n",
      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",
      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. \n",

He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",

But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A's their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. \n",
      " Héctor Rondón (3-1) pitched out of a jam in the seventh with help from a diving stop at shortstop by defensive replacement Jack Mayfield that held Ramón Laureano at third base with the infield drawn in. Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. \n",

Davis then hit a chopper toward the mound that bounced off Andriese's glove as he reached up. Marte could not handle the ball cleanly as the tying run scored. Gómez followed with a grounder inside the bag at third that drove in Hechavarría, but the ball boy stationed down the line — Arizona uses seniors dubbed \"Golden Glovers\" — fielded the ball thinking it was foul, and Davis was not permitted to score. \n",

      " Mike Moustakas hit his third home run in as many games for the Brewers — his 16th of the year plunged into the Allegheny River. But he left in the ninth inning after suffering a right hand bruise from being hit by a pitch. \n",
      " Pinch-hitter José Osuna homered for the Pirates while Elias Dîaz got three hits and drove in four runs. \n",
      " Milwaukee's lineup capitalized on struggling Nick Kingham, who lasted just three innings and gave up five runs on six hits with two home runs. \n",
      " Down 5-0, the Pirates scored four times in the third. Melky Cabrera started with an RBI single and Dîaz hit a three-run double. \n",

      " Pirates: Pittsburgh's Director of Sports Medicine, Tom Tomczyk, elaborated on the nature of RHP Keone Kela's right shoulder discomfort that will shut him down for 10 days. \"It's general wear and tear from a thrower's shoulder,\" Tomczyk said before the game. \"There are changes within the structures that are causing him tightness, causing him discomfort that he just doesn't feel as if he can let it go and be Keone right now.\" \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",

      " NEW YORK (AP) — DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",
      " Rafael Devers homered early for the third-place Red Sox, who fell 8½ games back in the division. That's the furthest they've been behind the Yankees since finishing the 2015 season nine games in the dust. \n",
      " PIRATES 9, BREWERS 4 \n",
      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",
      " REDS 9, NATIONALS 3 \n",
      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",
      " Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto's 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. \n",
      " Cincinnati's Joey Votto returned after missing three games with a tight right hamstring and had three hits. Eugenio Suarez was back in the lineup after getting hit on the left hand by Clay Holmes' pitch on Wednesday. \n",
      " TWINS 5, RAYS 3 \n",
      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking, two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and Minnesota beat Tampa Bay in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",

      " DENVER (AP) — Trevor Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and the Colorado Rockies beat the slumping Toronto Blue Jays for their sixth straight win. \n",
      " It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. \n",
      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",
      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. \n",

      " BALTIMORE (AP) — Dwight Smith's first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Núñez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home as the teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. Núñez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",

      " Charlie Tilson hit a two-run double to get Chicago's offense rolling. Tilson, Yoán Moncada, Yonder Alonso and Yolmer Sánchez each had two hits. The win moved the White Sox into a second-place tie in the AL Central with Cleveland. \n",
      " The Indians committed four errors. Four of Chicago's six runs against slumping Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer were unearned. \n",
      " Covey (1-4) settled down after allowing a leadoff homer to Francisco Lindor and scattered eight hits and ended a personal six-game losing streak. Josh Osich and Juan Minaya followed with three innings of one-hit relief. \n",
      " Bauer (4-5) allowed nine hits and struck out eight in seven innings, but shaky fielding doomed the right-hander. \n",

      " Spencer Turnbull (3-4) pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just five hits and one earned run in dealing the Braves their third straight loss at SunTrust Park. \n",
      " Goodrum, who came into the night hitting just .208, launched a 419-foot drive that nearly went into the Chop House restaurant above the right-field seats in the third inning. He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",

      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. He allowed two runs on five hits and three walks and had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks — both in the sixth. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. \n",

      " ST. LOUIS (AP) — Matt Carpenter hit a game-ending single against an unusual defensive alignment in the 10th to lead the Cardinals past the Chicago Cubs. \n",
      " The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage for May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). They went 8-18 in May 1980. \n",
      " Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter, and put four players on the right side of the infield. But Carpenter drove in Wong with a fly ball that found the grass in the left field corner. \n",
      " Carlos Martínez pitched a perfect eighth for St. Louis, and Jordan Hicks (2-2) worked two scoreless innings. The last pitch Hicks threw in the ninth registered at 104.3 mph, which is the fastest in baseball this season. \n",

      " SEATTLE (AP) — Jay Bruce hit his 300th career home run, Tom Murphy had a two-run shot, and the Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels. \n",
      " Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles, achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a dental procedure) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. \n",
      " The win snapped the Angels' three-game winning streak and wasted a fairly strong start by the Angels' Tyler Skaggs (4-5), who gave up just five hits but made a handful of costly mistakes while giving up four runs in seven innings. \n",
      " The Angels briefly got to Mike Leake (4-6) in the sixth inning when Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani hit back-to-back home runs to left field with two outs. It was the first time Los Angeles has hit consecutive home runs this season, but it wasn't enough for the Angels. \n",
      " PADRES 5, MARLINS 2 \n",
      " SAN DIEGO (AP) — Franmil Reyes, Hunter Renfroe and Ian Kinsler homered, and left-hander Joey Lucchesi combined with two relievers on a four-hitter for his first victory in six starts to lead the Padres past the Miami Marlins. \n",
      " Lucchesi (4-3) hadn't won since beating Cincinnati at home on April 21. He retired his first seven batters before allowing a double by Miguel Rojas in the third. He then retired eight straight before allowing a home run by pinch-hitter Rosell Herrera with one out in the sixth. Lucchesi struck out five and walked one. \n",
      " Craig Stammen pitched 1 2/3 hitless innings, Phil Maton allowed two singles to open the Marlins' ninth and Kirby Yates came on to get the final three outs for his 22nd save, best in the majors. \n",

      " The West-leading Dodgers improved to a major league-best 23-7 at home and have won 11 of their last 15 at Chavez Ravine against the East-leading Phillies. The Dodgers' 39 victories lead the NL. Los Angeles rapped out 12 hits while limiting the Phillies to five, including two in the ninth. \n",
      " Kenta Maeda (7-2) allowed two runs and three hits in six innings and won his fourth straight start. He struck out six and walked none. Kenley Jansen earned his 17th save. \n",

      " OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Derek Fisher hit a tiebreaking homer to lead off the eighth inning for his first long ball of the season and the short-handed Houston Astros rallied to beat the Athletics. \n",
      " The Astros trailed the A's 2-0 heading into the seventh inning on a night they were missing injured stars Jose Altuvé, Carlos Correa and George Springer. But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A's their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. \n",
      " Héctor Rondón (3-1) pitched out of a jam in the seventh with help from a diving stop at shortstop by defensive replacement Jack Mayfield that held Ramón Laureano at third base with the infield drawn in. Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. \n",
      " Houston's Josh Reddick snapped an 0-for-15 rut with a solo homer. \n",

      " Todd Frazier and Adeiny Hechavarria sparked New York's winning rally with consecutive two-out singles off Matt Andriese (3-4), putting runners on first and third. Pinch hitter J.D. Davis then hit a chopper toward the mound that bounced off Andriese's glove as he reached up. Marte could not handle the ball cleanly as the tying run scored. Gómez followed with a grounder inside the bag at third that drove in Hechavarría, but the ball boy stationed down the line — Arizona uses seniors dubbed \"Golden Glovers\" — fielded the ball thinking it was foul, and Davis was not permitted to score. \n",
      " Zack Wheeler (5-3) struck out nine in seven innings, and Robert Gsellman got three outs for his first save. \n",
      " Arizona lost its fifth straight game, matching a season high. Christian Walker and Ketel Marte homered for the Diamondbacks. \n",

      " A pair of softball heavyweights went the distance and a lot more as the top-ranked Angleton Lady Cats beat the defending Class 5A state champion Forney Jackrabbits 7-6 in 10 innings in a Class 5A state semifinal Friday. \n",
      " The two powerhouses played to a 4-4 deadlock through seven innings, and each team got a two-run homer in the eighth. In the bottom of the 10th, Angleton’s Mia Scott singled, stole second and scored when Avery Farr crushed a line drive to the wall in center field. \n",
      " Angleton pitcher Aaliyah Garcia limited Forney (36-4) to three hits over 10 innings. She held the hard-hitting Jackrabbits to just one hit over the first six innings, but four Lady Cat errors kept the game close. Garcia (29-2) struck out 13 and walked only one. Forney pitcher Savanna DesRochers, MVP of the 2018 championship game, allowed 12 hits while striking out three. \n",
      " Coffey, Ellie Grill and Scott had two hits each for Angleton (38-2), which is making its third appearance at state and won the championship in 1994. \n",
      " The Lady Cats will play Corpus Christi Calallen for the championship at 3 p.m. Saturday. \n",
      " Corpus Christi Calallen 5, The Colony 1: Lizette Del Angel fired a one-hit complete game as Calallen defeated 2017 Class 5A state champion The Colony on Friday. \n",
      " Del Angel (22-1) stuck out 10 and allowed only a sixth-inning bunt single to Jayda Coleman but did walk six. \n",
      " Calallen (35-5) took a 1-0 lead in the first when Avianna Gonzalez walked and scored on the first of four errors by The Colony. In the bottom of the inning, The Colony (39-3) tied it when Coleman walked, stole second and scored as the throw to second base sailed into the outfield. \n",
      " Calallen got two runs in the third as Jasmine Pena reached on an error, moved to second on an infield hit by Gonzalez and scored on a hit by Katherine Flores and then Gonzales scored on a double by Del Angel. \n",
      " Calallen added a pair of insurance runs in the seventh inning. Gonzalez was hit by a pitch and Raegan Tennill singled. Flores doubled home both with her second hit. \n",
      " Karlie Charles (37-2) of The Colony took the loss despite allowing only three earned runs and striking out seven. \n",
      " Klein Collins 11, New Braunfels Canyon 1: Katy Schaefer slammed a two-run, walk-off, run-rule homer with no outs in the bottom of the fifth inning as Klein Collins (38-2) beat New Braunfels Canyon (36-8) in the Class 6A semifinals. \n",
      " Collins pitcher Kenedy Hines (23-1) scattered three hits while striking out six and allowing one unearned run. Hines also went 4-for-4 and drove in three runs. Kylee Jacks, the courtesy running for Hines, scored three runs. \n",
      " Collins' first two batters were hit by pitches. An RBI hit by Schaefer and a couple of groundouts gave the Tigers a 3-0 lead. \n",
      " Collins scored twice in the second on RBIs by Hines and Schaefer. Then Hines singled home a pair of runs in the third. Arwin Callaway singled home Nadia Almanza in the fourth, but the Tigers hit into a bases-loaded double play that inning and were short two runs of ending the game on the 10-run rule. \n",
      " Collins resolved that quickly in the bottom of the fifth. Hines singled to lead off and was replaced by Jacks before Schaefer crushed a monster shot over the center field wall to end the game. \n",
      " Canyon shortstop Sydney Belvin had two hits in two at-bats and scored her team's lone run. \n",
      " Collins, in its second trip to the state tournament, will make its first finals appearance Saturday night against Katy. \n",
      " Katy 1, Keller 0: In a battle of of teams that have won three of the past four Class 6A state championships, Katy (36-2) used a steal of home in the bottom of the sixth inning to get past Keller (35-4-1) in their 6A semifinal. \n",
      " The Tigers got a masterpiece from senior pitcher Alyssa LeBlanc (23-1) and a savvy play by senior catcher Cait Calland, who stole home for the only run of the game. \n",
      " The victory was the 30th straight for Katy and earned the Tigers a rematch with Klein Collins, which defeated them 12-2 in an early season meeting, in Saturday's final. \n",
      " Calland led off the bottom of the sixth and took two balls before being hit by Keller pitcher Dylann Kaderka (25-2). She was bunted to second by Chloe Cobb and then stole third as LeBlanc walked. With two outs, LeBlanc and Cobb executed a double steal, and Calland was safe at home. \n",
      " “That was experience coming through in the clutch,” Katy coach Kalum Haack said of his senior batterymates. \n",
      " LeBlanc was dominant, throwing 90 pitches in seven innings, striking out seven, allowing four hits and walking two. She also had two of Katy’s three hits. \n",
      " Keller had won back-to-back titles in 2016 and 2017 to go with championships in 2003 and 2005. Katy claimed the title in 2015. This was the ninth appearance at state for Keller and the third for Katy. \n",
      " Humble Atascocita defeated New Braunfels Canyon 5-3 in the 2018 finals. \n",
      " D'Hanis 2, Dodd City 1: A one-hour rain delay couldn't prevent a fast start by the Cowgirls in a Class A semifinal Friday at Mary Hardin-Baylor in Belton. \n",
      " Coach Jose Martinez's squad used aggressive base running and timely hitting to take a quick 2-0 lead, and freshman pitcher Marissa Santos made that hold up as D'Hanis (23-7-1) beat Dodd City (9-9) to advance to its first state championship game. \n",
      " Cowgirls senior center fielder Chloe Cowan led off the bottom of the first with a bunt single. She then stole second base right before sophomore Madi Rhodes lined a single to center, scoring Cowan. Rhodes moved to second on the throw home. A wild pitch by Dodd City freshman Tori Dotson and a passed ball brought Rhodes home. \n",
      " In the top of the third, Dodd City freshman Kylee Graves scored on a hit by Journie Hilliard to cut the lead to 2-1. \n",
      " From there it was a pitchers' duel between Santos and Dotson, who gave up a combined five hits the rest of the way. Neither team got a runner past second base. Santos retired the Hornets 1-2-3 in the ninth, getting Hilliard to bounce out to shortstop to end the game. \n",
      " Santos finished with eight strikeouts, giving up just five hits and two walks. Dotson gave up just one earned run on five hits with nine strikeouts in six innings. \n",
      " Rains 6, Hallettsville 2: Rains touched up Gatorade Texas Player of the Year Rylee Trlicek for three first-inning runs, and sophomore pitcher Chanlee Oakes, with a solid defense behind her, did the rest as the No. 2 Lady Cats defeated No. 1 Hallettsville for the Class 3A state championship Thursday night. \n",
      " Rains (34-1) lost in the Class 4A semifinals last season and then dropped down to Class 3A in the UIL biannual realignment. The Lady Cats' only loss this season was to Class 5A state power Dripping Springs 1-0. \n",
      " Elissa Elliott's first-inning single scored Presley McAree and Jasmine Mott, and Oakes drove in Leo Terry with a groundout. \n",
      " The Lady Cats added three runs in the sixth. McAree tripled to lead off the inning and scored on another groundout by Oakes. Mott and Elliott singled, and Sarah Coffman hit a two-out single to right field to score both. \n",
      " Oakes, the championship game Most Valuable Player, slowed the hard-hitting Lady Brahmas with six shutout innings before allowing two runs in the seventh. She gave up seven hits and struck out six. Trlicek allowed five hits and struck out nine. \n",
      " Hallettsville's seventh-inning rally started with Emma Grahmann's leadoff double. She scored on a single by Kadie Zachary, who scored on a single by Julie Michalcik. \n",
      " Courtney Woytek led Hallettsville with two hits. \n",
      " Hallettsville had won 37 of its first 38 games, losing only to defending state 3A champion Santa Gertrudis Academy in the opener of their Region IV semifinal series. \n",

      " Aaron Hicks hit a tiebreaking two-run single in the third inning, and the New York Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox 4-1 Friday night in the opener of a rain-shortened, three-game series at Yankee Stadium. \n",
      " After rain postponed Thursday's scheduled series opener, the Yankees improved to 3-0 against the Red Sox this year and continued to roll. New York beat Chris Sale (1-7) for the second time this year and won for the 14th time in 17 games overall. \n",
      " Hicks gave the Yankees a 3-1 lead with two outs in the third when he came back from a 0-2 count and hit a full-count pitch from Sale into left field, scoring Brett Gardner and DJ LeMahieu. \n",
      " LeMahieu hit a game-tying double off the right-center field fence earlier in the third and then hit his sixth homer in the fifth inning to make it 4-1. LeMahieu's two clutch hits occurred after he struck out to start the game against Sale, who opened the game by striking out the side. \n",
      " Rafael Devers homered in the second inning for the Red Sox, who dropped their third straight and scored two runs or the fewer for the fifth time in a game started by Sale. \n",
      " Sale allowed four runs on seven hits and one walk in six innings. He recorded his sixth double-digit strikeout game of the season by getting 10 strikeouts. \n",
      " New York starter J.A. Happ (5-3) allowed one run on three hits in five innings to win his fourth straight decision. Happ struck out five, walked two and threw 84 pitches while improving to 9-4 in his career against Boston. \n",
      " Happ allowed two of his hits in the second inning, but after an infield hit by Jackie Bradley Jr., he retired seven straight before Eduardo Nunez opened the fifth with a single. Following an intentional walk to Mookie Betts with two outs, Nunez was picked off second by catcher Gary Sanchez. \n",
      " Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle and Zack Britton followed Happ and pitched a scoreless inning apiece. Aroldis Chapman pitched a 1-2-3 ninth and notched his 16th save in 17 opportunities. \n",
      " The Red Sox lost first baseman Steve Pearce to back spasms after he took his first at-bat in the second inning. Pearce, who was replaced by Michael Chavis, is listed as day-to-day. \n",

      " Gallo's 1st career grand slam leads Rangers past Royals \n",
      " Updated: Fri 10:43 PM, May 31, 2019 \n",
      " ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Joey Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth inning outburst as the Texas Rangers rallied past the Kansas City Royals 6-2 Friday night. \n",
      " Gallo's home run, his team leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet and landed in the second seating area beyond the center-field wall. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. Jurado allowed two runs on five hits and three walks. The second-year right-hander, who was recalled from Triple-A Nashville on April 26, had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks — both in the sixth. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. \n",
      " Texas loaded the bases in the sixth inning on outfield singles by Shin-Soo Choo and Elvis Andrus and a chopper hit between third base and the mound by Hunter Pence. Duffy fielded Pence's grounder, but his throw to first base was late. \n",
      " Duffy walked Nomar Mazara with the bases loaded to tie the score 2-2. Gallo then launched a 1-1 fastball to end a six-game homerless streak, which matched his longest this season. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Cuthbert, who earlier Friday had his contract selected from Triple-A Omaha, hit an opposite-field homer that just cleared the right-field wall in the second. \n",
      " Gordon's triple in the fifth inning turned around centerfielder Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway center, scoring  Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. \n",
      " The Royals lead the majors with 24 triples. \n",
      " Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base. That gave the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",
      " PRE-GAME MOVES \n",
      " To make room for Cuthbert, the Royals designated INF-OF Chris Owings for assignment. The Rangers selected the contract of RHP David Carpenter from Nashville and optioned OF Zack Granite to Nashville. \n",

      " ATLANTA — Niko Goodrum homered twice and had a career-high five hits, Nicholas Castellanos and Grayson Greiner also went deep, and the Detroit Tigers romped to an 8-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Friday night. \n",
      " Spencer Turnbull pitched into the seventh inning, allowing just five hits and one earned run in dealing the Braves their third straight loss at SunTrust Park. \n",
      " Goodrum, who came into the night hitting just .208, launched a 419-foot drive that nearly went into the Chop House restaurant above the right-field seats in the third inning. He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. \n",
      " Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",
      " Greiner homered in the second, and Castellanos added a two-run shot that capped a fifth that was sparked by JaCoby Jones' leadoff triple. He got his left foot to the bag just ahead of Josh Donaldson's tag on the knee — a call that was challenged by the Braves but upheld after a video review. \n",
      " Buck Farmer came on in the seventh when the Braves loaded the bases against Turnbull (3-4) with no outs. Atlanta got a run on Brian McCann's sacrifice fly and reloaded the bases when Ozzie Albies reached on an infield single that deflected off Farmer's glove. But the Tigers reliever escaped the jam when pinch hitter Charlie Culberson grounded into an inning-ending double play. \n",
      " After two straight strong starts, Atlanta's Mike Foltynewicz (1-4) had another rough night. His slider was dominating at times — he struck out eight — but too many mistakes up in the zone doomed the right-hander. \n",
      " Foltynewicz surrendered seven hits and five runs in five innings. \n",

      " EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Franchy Cordero hit a grand slam in the third inning, leading the El Paso Chihuahuas to a 24-4 win over the Tacoma Rainiers on Saturday. The win snapped a three-game losing streak for the Chihuahuas and a four-game winning streak for the Rainiers. \n",
      " The grand slam by Cordero came in the midst of a seven-run inning and gave the Chihuahuas a 7-1 lead. Later in the inning, Luis Urias scored on an error and Seth Mejias-Brean hit an RBI single. \n",
      " El Paso later scored in five additional innings, including an eight-run eighth, when Urias and Michael Gettys hit three-run home runs to help punctuate the blowout. \n",
      " Francisco Mejia homered, tripled and doubled, scoring five runs and driving home a couple for El Paso. Urias homered, doubled twice and singled, driving in four runs and scoring three. \n",
      " El Paso southpaw Dillon Overton (1-2) picked up a quality start and the win after allowing three runs on six hits over seven innings. Opposing starter Justus Sheffield (2-4) took the loss in the Pacific Coast League game after allowing seven runs and six hits over 2 2/3 innings. \n",

      " CINCINNATI — Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Tanner Roark’s streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Washington Nationals to a 5-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in a stadium where they’ve dominated. \n",
      " Washington has won nine of its last 10 at Great American Ball Park. Overall, the Nationals are 17-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason. Parra’s homer in the second inning ended Roark’s string of 35ß innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. \n",
      " Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Eric Fedde, who escaped a pair of bases-loaded threats in his four-plus innings. The Nationals turned double plays in the first, third and fifth innings to blunt rallies. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Tanner Rainey, the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " Rainey (1-1) got into the game in the fifth inning and fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds’ successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. \n",
      " Washington’s Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. It was the longest hitting streak by a player under age 21 since Manny Machado also hit in 14 straight games in 2013. \n",
      " Indians 5, White Sox 2: Carlos Santana and Leonys Martin homered and Cleveland took advantage of a blunder on the bases to end Chicago’s five-game streak. \n",
      " Sanchez got caught in a rundown in the third inning and was tagged out by third baseman Jose Ramirez, who then threw over to first base to get Tilson retreating to the bag to end the inning. \n",
      " Santana’s solo homer off Ivan Nova (3-5) made it 2-1 in the sixth. \n",
      " Jake Bauers hit a leadoff double in the Cleveland seventh and with two outs, Martin broke an 0-for-14 slump with his seventh home run. \n",
      " Giants 8, Orioles 2: Backed by timely hitting and an error-free defense, San Francisco starter Shaun Anderson stuck around for seven innings and earned his first big league win, over Baltimore. \n",
      " Brandon Belt drove in four runs and Buster Posey homered for the Giants, who built a 7-1 lead in the fifth and cruised to only their second win in 10 games. The Giants came in ranked last in the NL with a .221 batting average and had scored as many as seven runs only once in their previous 19 games. \n",
      " Twins 6, Rays 2: Marwin Gonzalez and Byron Buxton both homered and drove in two runs as Minnesota beat Tampa Bay. \n",
      " Minnesota, which owns the best record in the majors at 39-18, has scored at least three runs in 25 straight games, setting a single-season franchise record. \n",

      " ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Joey Gallo stood in center field trying not to beat himself up after misplaying two fly balls into triples as he and the Texas Rangers trailed the Kansas City Royals by two runs going into the sixth inning. \n",
      " Soon enough, Gallo took out his frustrations on the baseball. \n",
      " Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth inning outburst as the Rangers rallied past the Royals 6-2 on Friday night. \n",
      " The Rangers have won five of their last six home games while the Royals have lost of four of their last five overall. \n",
      " Gallo's home run, his team-leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet and landed in the second seating area beyond the center-field wall. \n",
      " \"Things turned around quick,\" Gallo said. In his first season playing regularly in center, he also redeemed himself defensively by finishing the game with a diving catch in left-center on a ball hit by Billy Hamilton. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. Jurado allowed two runs on five hits and three walks. The second-year right-hander, who was recalled from Triple-A Nashville on April 26, had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " All of that on a night when his parents, Ariel Sr. and Yizel, had traveled from Panama to see him pitch in the majors for the first time. \n",
      " \"That was something special,\" Jurado said through an interpreter. \n",
      " With Jurado outpitched by veteran Royals left-hander Danny Duffy through five innings, Rangers manager Chris Woodward thought his youngster deserved a better fate given the circumstances. \n",
      " \"I'm saying a little prayer 'cause the baseball gods should be with us on this one,\" Woodward said. \"Like, I was hoping for three (runs).\" \n",
      " Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26, his first start of the season after recovering from last year's shoulder injury. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, he allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks — both in the sixth. \n",
      " \"This game will rip your heart out sometimes,\" Duffy said. \"But I've got to turn the page after tonight and go back out there, try to be better next time.\" \n",
      " Texas loaded the bases in the sixth inning on outfield singles by Shin-Soo Choo and Elvis Andrus and a chopper hit between third base and the mound by Hunter Pence. Duffy fielded Pence's grounder, but his throw to first base was late. \n",
      " Duffy walked Nomar Mazara with the bases loaded to tie the score at 2. Gallo then launched a 1-1 fastball to end a six-game homerless streak, which matched his longest this season. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Cuthbert, who earlier Friday had his contract selected from Triple-A Omaha, hit an opposite-field homer that just cleared the right-field wall in the second and also made a standout play at third base. \n",
      " \"He's always been a really good defender at third base for us,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said of Cuthbert. \"That's kind of expected.\" \n",
      " Gordon's triple in the fifth inning turned around Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway center, scoring Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. \n",
      " All of that was forgotten in the bottom of the sixth. \n",
      " Notes: Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. The Royals lead the majors with 24 triples. Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base to give the Royals a major league-leading 53. To make room for Cuthbert, the Royals designated INF-OF Chris Owings for assignment. The Rangers selected the contract of RHP David Carpenter from Nashville and optioned OF Zack Granite to Nashville. Royals OF Hunter Dozier (right thorax tightness) is day to day, leaving Thursday's game in the fifth inning and sitting out Friday. Rangers OF Willie Calhoun (left quad strain) will begin on-field work today.

      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pittsburgh Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin in a 9-4 victory Friday night. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Archer struck out seven and walked two while needed only 92 pitches to get 21 outs as the injury-ravaged Pirates won for only the third time in their last 11 games. \n",
      " Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command briefly abandoned him in the third inning. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh's lead to 5-1. Peralta replaced Chacin and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh's advantage to 7-1. \n",
      " Chacin — a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series — saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " Aguilar hit his first home run in a month when he took Archer to the bushes beyond the center-field wall in leading off the third. Hiura pushed Milwaukee's home run total to 98 — tops in the National League — with a three-run shot to center in fourth. \n",
      " Hiura had three of Milwaukee's six hits, but the second baseman was also charged with two of the Brewers' three errors on a funky play in the seventh when a liner by Jacob Stallings deflected off Peralta's glove to Hiura, who couldn't corral it initially, then threw into the Milwaukee dugout when he rushed his throw in an effort to get Stallings. \n",

Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",

      " The victory placed LSU in a winner's bracket game Saturday night against Southern Mississippi (39-19), which defeated Arizona State 15-3 earlier Friday in the Baton Rouge regional. The Sun Devils (37-18) and Seawolves (31-22) were slated to play an elimination game Saturday afternoon. \n",
      " Stoney Brook starter Greg Marino (5-5) allowed seven runs — two earned — before leaving the mound after Duplantis' run-scoring single in the second. \n",
      " The Tigers scored their first five runs with two outs in the first inning after a throwing error, hit batter and walk loaded the bases. Marino walked in a run before Saul Garza's opposite field double down the right field line cleared the bases and Broussard's single drove in Garza. \n",

      " Danny Lynch was 3-for-5 with a home run, double and four runs batted in for the Golden Eagles (39-19), who won the Conference USA tournament last week and have won six straight. \n",

      " BALTIMORE (AP) — Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the center field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.'s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " \"I feel like every time he is around I do something,\" the younger Smith said. \"He's a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.\" \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " \"It's been a rough couple of months,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We've had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.\" \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " \"A great day by the kid,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.\" \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz's ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn't allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " \"It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,\" Cashner said. \"I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.\" \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles' bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year's Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. \"Nothing's really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,\" Elias said. ... The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Orioles: OF Mark Trumbo (knee surgery) had his third rehab assignment for Double-A Bowie. He went 2 for 4 with a strikeout and run. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Giants: Shaun Anderson (0-1, 4.80 ERA) will make his fourth major-league start. He allowed six runs (four earned) and nine hits over five innings in his last outing May 26 against Arizona. \n",
      " Orioles: David Hess (1-6, 6.71 ERA) has not won since carrying a no-hitter into the seventh inning April 1 against Toronto. He has given up a league-leading 18 homers over 11 appearances. \n",

      " AP-BBC--NCAA Regionals Rdp,2nd Ld-Writethru \n",
      " Joshua L. Jones, ASSOCIATED PRESS \n",
      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " View all (4) \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",
      " — Oregon State's Adley Rutschman, batting .420 and the likely No. 1 pick in next week's Major League Baseball draft, was intentionally walked with the bases loaded to pull the Beavers within 5-3 in the seventh inning. \n",
      " — Dallas Baptist knocked out Florida starter Tommy Mace after 1 1/3 innings and collected 17 hits against four pitchers in an 11-8 win. \n",
      " — Aaron Schunk hit two of Georgia's three home runs and had five RBIs in a 13-3 win over Mercer. \n",
      " — Florida State's Mike Salvatore had four of his team's 20 hits and Drew Mendoza joined Becker in homering twice against FAU. \n",
      " — Auburn 8-hole hitter Steven Williams had four hits, including a three-run homer, and five RBIs against Coastal Carolina. \n",
      " — Tristin English went 4 for 4 with five RBIs to lead Georgia Tech past Florida A&M 13-2. \n",
      " MOUND MARVELS \n",
      " — Vanderbilt's Drake Fellows earned his nation-leading 12th win, scattering seven hits and striking out nine in an 8-2 win over Ohio State. \n",
      " — Brendan Beck and Cody Jensen combined on a four-hitter in Stanford's 11-0 win over Sacramento State. \n",
      " — Codie Paiva and Nick Frasso combined on a four-hitter in Loyola Marymount's 3-1 win over Baylor. \n",
      " — Micah Dallas limited Army to three hits and a run in seven innings in Texas Tech's 11-2 win. \n",
      " — Clemson's Davis Sharpe pitched the final 6 2/3 innings against Illinois in his first career relief appearance. \n",

      " Max Muncy and Enrique Hernandez also hit home runs, while Kenta Maeda pitched six strong innings, as the Dodgers won for the seventh time in their last eight games. \n",
      " Andrew McCutchen hit a home run for the Phillies, who have lost consecutive games after winning five of their previous six. Philadelphia starter Jake Arrieta had an RBI single, but tied a season high by giving up five runs over five innings. \n",
      " The Dodgers improved to 11-4 at home over the Phillies going back to 2015, and scored at least five runs in all 11 of those victories. \n",
      " Muncy’s third-inning two-run home run, his 12th of the season, gave the Dodgers an early 2-0 lead. The Phillies tied the score after McCutchen’s fourth-inning home run, his 10th, was followed by Arrieta’s RBI single in the fifth. \n",
      " The Dodgers took it to Arrieta (5-5) in their half of the fifth, first getting a solo shot from Pederson, his 17th. The blast to right field traveled 445 feet to the back of the bleachers. Seager hit a two-run homer two batters later, his seventh, to give the Dodgers a 5-2 advantage. \n",
      " Arrieta needed 97 pitches to go five innings and failed to go six innings for just the third time in 12 starts this season. \n",
      " Hernandez added an insurance run in the eighth inning with his ninth homer of the season. It was the fourth time the Dodgers have hit four or more home runs in a game this season. \n",
      " Maeda (7-2) gave up two runs on three hits over six innings with no walks and six strikeouts. The right-hander improved to 5-0 at home this season with a 1.69 ERA. Kenley Jansen got the final out for his 17th save. \n",
      " Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner missed his second consecutive game with mild tightness in his right hamstring. The Dodgers were also without manager Dave Roberts, who left the team to attend his son Cole’s high school graduation. \n",

      " Smith, hitting .183 this season, has struggled at the plate offensively, but the 22-year-old is beginning to show some positive signs. Not only did he collect three hits for the third time this season, but Smith also homered for the second time in three games. The 2017 fourth rounder impressed last year during his first full season and hit .302 with 25 homers over two levels and was promoted to Double-A for the 2019 campaign. \n",

      " Orioles: DL Hall, LHP ( No. 3 ) -- 5 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 3 BB, 6 K (Class A Advanced Frederick) \n",
      " Hall, the 21st overall pick from the 2017 Draft, has yielded one run or fewer in three of his past four starts. The 20-year-old has pitched to a 4.11 ERA through 35 innings in his first season with Frederick and has 59 strikeouts compared to 22 walks. Hall was one of the top high school lefties in the 2017 Draft, and the Orioles kept him on pitch counts in his 2018 full-season debut. The organization is likely to manage his workload again this season, which is the five innings matches his season high. \n",

      " Franco extended his hitting streak to eight games with a two-run homer in the first inning, then later added a double for his seventh multihit performance during the streak. Franco's stock skyrocketed last year when he hit .351/.418/.587 over 61 games in his professional debut and is following that up with another impressive campaign, hitting .324 through 46 games. \n",

      " Houck has struggled in May. The 22-year-old had given up 17 runs over five starts (24 1/3 innings) in the month entering play, but everything changed on Friday night. Houck put together his best starts since throwing back-to-back scoreless gems in late April. Houck, a first-round pick from the 2017 Draft, actually looked like he was in store for another rough outing. Binghamton loaded the bases with no outs in the first, but Houck was able to get a strikeout and then induce a ground-ball double play to get out of the jam. He went on to throw 60 of his 99 pitches for strikes and pick up his fifth win of the season. Dalbec, who is hitting .247 this season, hit .257 with 32 homers in 2018. \n",

      " Abreu retired 12 of the final 13 batters he faced, but it was clear way earlier in the game that the 23-year-old had everything working. Abreu threw 55 of his 84 pitches for strikes in what his first scoreless start of the year. Abreu, whom the Yankees acquired in a 2016 trade with the Astros, has plus stuff, but struggles with consistency and command. In fact, in his start prior to Friday, he walked six and gave up six runs over five innings. After a couple of stints with the Yankees, Adams made his first Triple-A start since May 7 and picked up his third win of the season. The 24-year-old threw 73 pitches, 47 strikes, and lowered his ERA to an even 4.00 (36 innings). \n",

      " Naylor matched his career high for hits and hit his second homer of the season in Lake County's win over West Michigan. The 19-year-old, a 2018 first-round pick, is hitting .223 through his first 38 games after hitting .274 in his professional debut. While Naylor has struggled at the plate this season, he was considered one of the better high school hitters in last year's Draft, so it's expected he'll turn it around. \n",

Back with the Blue Rocks, Hicklen got off to a slow start this season, but has begun to pick things up. After hitting .204 in April, Hicklen hit .279 in May.

      " Eventually someone will score a run off Mize again, however it may not be for a while. Mize, 22, put together another solid outing for Erie and hasn't yielded a run in three straight starts, a span of 20 innings. The No. 1 overall pick from last year's Draft has pitched to a 1.21 ERA through his first seven Double-A starts and has actually held opponents without an earned run in nine of his 12 starts across two levels this season. \n",

The 22-year-old, a first round pick out of Oregon State last season, is hitting .310 through 49 games after hitting .303 in his professional debut. Larnach showed an advanced approach at the plate prior to the Draft and that's certainly carried over to the beginning of his professional career. \n",

      " Sheets has homered in back-to-back games and his five homers this year (48 games) have him within one of his career high, which he set last year over 119 games. The 23-year-old, a 2017 second-round pick, is getting his first taste of the Double-A level this year and it took him a little bit of time to adjust. After hitting .207 in April, Sheets hit .265 in May, bringing his average up to .239 on the year. \n",

Heim, 23, has hits in seven of his past nine games and is hitting .295 this season, his first with Midland. The Orioles drafted Heim in the fourth round of the 2013 Draft and traded him to the Rays in 2016. He was then traded again, this time to Oakland, in 2017. \n",

The 19-year-old is in the middle of a seven-game hitting streak and also has hits in nine of his past 10 games. He also has multihit performances in five of his past six games and has brought his average up from .196 to .246 during his current hitting streak. The Angels grabbed Adams with the 17th overall pick in last year's Draft and while he's still raw, he has the chance to develop into an impact player on both sides of the ball. \n",

The 21-year-old, whom the Astros picked in the third round of the 2018 Draft, hit .378 in May after hitting .238 in April. Pena is a defensive-minded shortstop and the top defensive shortstop in the Astros' system, but his bat has also been impressive this season. \n",

      " Bishop hit his seventh homer of the season and matched his season high for RBIs. Through his career Bishop has been more of a contact hitter than a power hitter, but he's shown a bit more pop this season and is already one homer shy of his career best, a mark he set last season. Bishop made his Major League debut in Japan to open the season and was also called up in late April. He's appeared in eight games with the Mariners and is 2-for-20. \n",

      " Hernandez, who threw 63 of his 89 pitches for strikes, retired 13 of the first 14 batters he faced as he cruised through his best start of the season. The 10 strikeouts marked a season high for Hernandez, who fanned 134 over 121 1/3 innings a season ago. Hernandez, whom the Rangers signed in 2013, has electric stuff and clearly has no problem generating strikeouts, but has struggled with command this season and throughout his career. The zero walks were a first for Hernandez this season and certainly gave a glimpse into how dominant he can be when he's locating his pitches. \n",

Harris, a bit undersized at 5-foot-10, was overlooked by several teams in the Draft, but early indications are the Braves may have gotten a steal.

Since then, Stewart has posted back-to-back quality starts and given up just three runs over 13 innings. The Phillies grabbed Stewart in the 20th round of the 2015 Draft, and after he put together a breakout campaign (8-1, 2.06 ERA) in 2018, he was shipped to the Marlins as part of the J.T.

The 25-year-old matched his season high for strikeouts and matched his season low for walks. Mella cruised through the bulk of his outing, but he found himself in a bit of a jam in the sixth inning as he gave up a double and issued a walk to the first two batters of the frame.

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central.

      " Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. \n",

Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",

      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Tanner Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Washington Nationals to a 5-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in a stadium where they've dominated. \n",
      " Washington has won nine of its last 10 at Great American Ball Park. Overall, the Nationals are 17-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason. Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 35 1/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. \n",
      " Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Eric Fedde, who escaped a pair of bases-loaded threats in his four-plus innings. The Nationals turned double plays in the first, third and fifth innings to blunt rallies. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Tanner Rainey, the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " Rainey (1-1) got into the game in the fifth inning and fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. He hadn't allowed a pair of homers in his last 13 starts. \n",

      " Red Raiders secure runs in clutch moments, down Army in regional opener \n",
      "  \n",
      " By Carlos Silva Jr. A-J Media \n",
      " Friday \n",
      " May 31, 2019 at 9:28 PM May 31, 2019 at 9:28 PM \n",
      " Texas Tech was dialed in. \n",
      " That was the best way to describe the No. 8 national seed Red Raiders, who were hosting Army on Friday in the NCAA Lubbock Regional opener at Dan Law Field at Rip Griffin Park. \n",
      " Nothing encapsulated the focus more than the success Texas Tech enjoyed when a batter walked up to the box with two outs. \n",
      " Cody Masters started it off by hitting the first pitch he saw to shallow-center field for a two-out, two-RBI single which provided some insurance runs and propelled the Red Raiders to a 11-2 victory over the fourth-seeded Black Knights. \n",
      " \"That was huge,\" Texas Tech senior Cameron Warren said of Master's two RBI in the first inning. \"Cody said he didn't barrel the ball or have any hits today. I said, you had one of the biggest hits of the day, giving us the 3-0 lead, it was huge. It was one of the biggest hits of the day.\" \n",
      " Texas Tech (40-17) set up a matchup between the winner of Florida and Dallas Baptist, who played in the nightcap, at 6 p.m. Saturday as part of the winner's bracket. Army (35-25) is set to play at noon Saturday against the loser between the Gators and Patriots. \n",
      " The Red Raiders set themselves up for success thanks to starting pitcher Micah Dallas setting the tempo early on. The freshman right-handed hurler retired the first 12 batters he saw and held a no-hit bid through 5 1/3 innings. \n",
      " \"I feel like my fastball command, I had it most of the time,\" Dallas said of what made him successful during a 99-pitch outing Friday. \"My slider, I couldn't really lean on that as much as I normally do, but I think that my fastball had good life on it, so I think that's why.\" \n",
      " Dallas' success was aided by his offense, which got going in the bottom of the first. \n",
      " Texas Tech's Gabe Holt started things off by smacking a ball down the right-field line for a lead-off triple. The speedy sophomore trotted home after Tanner O'Tremba, who was inserted into the lineup to make up for the void of Dylan Neuse, hit the ball deep enough to center field to provide a 1-0 lead with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " Two batters later, which include a Brian Klein fly out and back-to-back singles by Josh Jung and Warren, Masters saw a pitch he liked and got just enough to hit a Texas leaguer to center field that scored Jung and Warren to provide the Red Raiders a 3-0 advantage after one complete. \n",
      " \"I think Cam said it best, Cody's hit was a big hit,\" Texas Tech coach Tim Tadlock said. \n",
      " Dallas, who finished his first-ever postseason start after giving up three hits, yielded one walk and struck out seven in seven innings on the way to his sixth win, continued his dominance while Texas Tech's lineup continued to swing strong. \n",
      " \"Obviously he's a new arm, we haven't seen too many guys that have the kind of stuff that he has with a hard fastball like that and a sharp slider,\" Army's Jacob Hurtubise said of Dallas. \"So I think just going in there and adjusting was a little bit of a struggle at first. ... But he threw phenomenally, especially in those first couple innings.\" \n",
      " Holt set the table wit a two-out double before O'Tremba, who earned his first start since April 16, singled to left to put runners on the corners. Klein capitalized on the scoring opportunity by sending a to left-center field for a two-RBI double that increased the scoring gap to 5-0 at the end of two. \n",
      " The Black Knights would not spoil the no-hit bid until the fifth inning and did not score their first run until Trey Martin collected an RBI-double in the sixth to scored Andre Walden and put things at 8-1. \n",
      " \"Yeah, it's something that we talk about a lot,\" said Army's Josh White, who finished 2-for-2 with one RBI, about the Red Raiders two-out hitting. \"Two-out hits are really big for momentum swings throughout the game, and they had a couple balls fall and we didn't really string anything together like that. And with two outs we just didn't present ourselves with the opportunities like they did and they took advantage of them and we didn't. So that's it.\" \n",
      " But it was too late as the Red Raiders kept scoring — highlighted by a three-run home run by Warren, his 15th of the season, in the seventh — on the way to claiming the regional-opening triumph. \n",
      " \"Just a fastball over the middle,\" Warren said when asked to describe his home run. \"Tad gave me green light, so I was like hopefully I get a barrel on this one.\" \n",

      " DENVER -- After hitting two homers and driving in a career-high seven runs in the Rockies’ sixth straight victory, 13-6 over the Blue Jays at Coors Field, Trevor Story found it cool to acknowledge May -- one that was poor offensively before turning boiling hot -- before flipping the calendar. \n",
      " DENVER -- After hitting two homers and driving in a career-high seven runs in the Rockies’ sixth straight victory, 13-6 over the Blue Jays at Coors Field, Trevor Story found it cool to acknowledge May -- one that was poor offensively before turning boiling hot -- before flipping the calendar. \n",
      " “This game so repetitive and monotonous that a month can go by and you didn’t realize that May just went by,” Story said. “We’re going to ride this feeling that we have now and try to extend that as long as we can.” \n",
      " • Box score \n",
      " Story powered the Rockies’ attack on Friday night with a pair of two-run home runs and a bases-clearing double in the third innings, giving him a career-high seven RBIs. He went 3-for-4 with a walk and four runs scored. \n",
      " The Rockies’ 183 runs were their most in any month since scoring 173 in August 2016. They also led the Majors in May in batting average (.294), and topped National League clubs in slugging percentage (.516) and on-base percentage (.359). Plus, Nolan Arenado, who registered three hits and drove in three runs on Friday and Story called “the rock of the lineup,” batted an unreal .425. Colorado went 16-10 and ended the month by scoring 81 runs in its last 11 games. \n",
      " But the true story of May for the Rockies, believe it or not, is one of overcoming empty offense. \n",
      " In eight of Colorado’s first 14 games of the month, it finished with double-digit strikeouts. There was the frigid, strange May 14 night in Boston when the Rockies fanned 24 times -- 17 against Red Sox ace Chris Sale -- but pulled out a 5-4 victory. \n",
      " But by the time Colorado was swept in three games in Philadelphia, with Aaron Nola fanning a career-high 12 and the Rockies making it a baker’s dozen in the middle game of the series, they had lost four straight, dropping to five games below .500. That led to a strikeout summit. \n",
      " “We had a meeting in Philly where we addressed it,” said Story, who tied former Brewer J.J. Hardy for most home runs (15) before June 1 for a shortstop in NL history. “There are different kinds of strikeouts -- ones that are a little more acceptable and ones that are big no-nos in certain spots. It’s been a team effort. Collectively, we’ve grinded on that and tried to really cut down on those. \n",
      " “We feel the best teams, the best offenses, they don’t strike out like that. We knew we had it in us, but seeing it being done is nice.” \n",
      " As the Rockies head into June, Arenado is on an 11-game hit streak. Raimel Tapia, who scored a career-high four runs, has a 10-game streak. Heck, starter German Marquez (6-2), who struck out seven and held the Blue Jays to two runs over seven innings, has a five-game streak -- the most by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton’s eight-gamer from July 22-Aug. 29, 2002. The right-hander went 2-for-3 against Toronto. \n",
      " Arenado is hitting .344, David Dahl .318, Tony Wolters .303 and Story .294. Charlie Blackmon -- who hasn’t played since last Thursday with a right calf injury -- is at .300. Ian Desmond was batting .140 through April 14 but has hit .297 since to pull his season mark to .250. \n",
      " And the only time the Rockies have reached double digits in K’s over the past eight games was Thursday, but that game took 11 innings and was won thanks to an RBI single by Daniel Murphy, who slumped after returning from a finger injury but has gotten hot of late. \n",
      " “We’re swinging at strikes, taking balls,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “Our strikeout rate the last couple weeks has gone down. Our walk rate has gone up. Guys are swinging a little bit more freely. They’re swinging aggressive early in the count at good pitches to hit. They’re fighting with two strikes, putting the ball in play. \n",
      " “These things add up to a good offense.” \n",

      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman’s last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " Illinois State continued its surge under first-year coach Steve Holm, who took over a Redbirds team that went 22-30 a year ago and led them to a share of the Missouri Valley Conference title. \n",
      " Illinois State made the most of its three hits against Louisville starter Reid Detmers. Joe Aeilts doubled in a run in the first inning and Jeremy Gaines’s two-run double in the sixth broke a 2-2 tie. Matt Walker scattered six hits, walked two and struck out seven in a complete game. \n",

      " Tanner Roark's first career homer wasn't enough to get the win against his former Nationals teammates. Instead, it went to the other half of the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " \"A weird day,\" Nationals starter Eric Fedde said. \n",
      " Except for the outcome. Nothing surprising about the Nationals winning in Cincinnati. \n",
      " Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Nationals to a 5-2 victory — their ninth in 10 games at Great American Ball Park. \n",

      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason for Tanner Rainey. Both pitchers came away with a career moment. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Fedde, his first in 336 career plate appearances. \n",
      " \"I felt like my emotions were under control,\" said Roark, who went six innings. \"It's definitely a tough loss. The bunt and the home run felt good. I would've rather have won the game.\" \n",
      " Two homers made the difference. \n",
      " Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 36 2/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Rainey (1-1), who got into the game in the fifth. He acknowledged that he had extra motivation facing his former team, and he fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. \n",
      " \"For me getting the first win in here, it is special,\" Rainey said. \n",
      " Rainey fanned Yasiel Puig with a runner on third to end the fifth inning, and then struck out two more batters in the sixth. \n",
      " \"He's going to be a good one, he really is,\" manager Dave Martinez said. \"He has that look when he comes out of the bullpen that I really like,\" \n",
      " Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Washington's Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. It was the longest hitting streak by a player under age 21 since Manny Machado also hit in 14 straight games in 2013. \n",
      " DOMINATION \n",
      " The Nationals are 17-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " DOUBLE TROUBLE \n",
      " The Reds hit into double plays in the first, third and fifth innings, helping Fedde escape trouble. \n",
      " \"That's the best I could have hoped for,\" said Fedde, who gave up six hits and three walks in four-plus innings. \"That's when the ground ball really comes into play. That saved me today.\" \n",
      " STREAKS \n",
      " Washington's Anthony Rendon has reached base in 18 consecutive games, going 22 for 64 with six doubles, two triples, four homers and 16 walks. Cincinnati's Nick Senzel doubled, extending his streak to nine games, the longest by a Red this season. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Nationals: Reliever Trevor Rosenthal threw 29 pitches in the bullpen Saturday without problem and is expected to start a rehab assignment on Tuesday. He's been sidelined by a viral infection since April 26. \n",
      " Reds: Joey Votto was in the starting lineup for the second straight game after missing three with hamstring tightness. Votto returned Friday, had three hits during a 9-3 win, and left after five innings as a precaution. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Nationals: Max Scherzer (2-5) has no-decisions in his last two starts despite allowing one run and 11 hits in 12 innings. \n",
      " Reds: Sonny Gray (2-4) has won his last two starts, allowing one run and 10 hits in 12 innings. \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",

      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",

      " — Oregon State's Adley Rutschman, batting .420 and the likely No. 1 pick in next week's Major League Baseball draft, was intentionally walked with the bases loaded to pull the Beavers within 5-3 in the seventh inning. \n",

      " CINCINNATI \n",
      " Tanner Roark's first career homer wasn't enough to get the win against his former Nationals teammates. Instead, it went to the other half of the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " \"A weird day,\" Nationals starter Eric Fedde said. \n",
      " Except for the outcome. Nothing surprising about the Nationals winning in Cincinnati. \n",
      " Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Nationals to a 5-2 victory — their ninth in 10 games at Great American Ball Park. \n",

      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason for Tanner Rainey. Both pitchers came away with a career moment. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Fedde, his first in 336 career plate appearances. \n",
      " \"I felt like my emotions were under control,\" said Roark, who went six innings. \"It's definitely a tough loss. The bunt and the home run felt good. I would've rather have won the game.\" \n",
      " Two homers made the difference. \n",
      " Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 36 2/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Rainey (1-1), who got into the game in the fifth. He acknowledged that he had extra motivation facing his former team, and he fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. \n",
      " \"For me getting the first win in here, it is special,\" Rainey said. \n",
      " Rainey fanned Yasiel Puig with a runner on third to end the fifth inning, and then struck out two more batters in the sixth. \n",
      " \"He's going to be a good one, he really is,\" manager Dave Martinez said. \"He has that look when he comes out of the bullpen that I really like,\" \n",
      " Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Washington's Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. It was the longest hitting streak by a player under age 21 since Manny Machado also hit in 14 straight games in 2013. \n",

      " DOUBLE TROUBLE \n",
      " The Reds hit into double plays in the first, third and fifth innings, helping Fedde escape trouble. \n",
      " \"That's the best I could have hoped for,\" said Fedde, who gave up six hits and three walks in four-plus innings. \"That's when the ground ball really comes into play. That saved me today.\" \n",
      " STREAKS \n",
      " Washington's Anthony Rendon has reached base in 18 consecutive games, going 22 for 64 with six doubles, two triples, four homers and 16 walks. Cincinnati's Nick Senzel doubled, extending his streak to nine games, the longest by a Red this season. \n",

      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman's last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " Illinois State continued its surge under first-year coach Steve Holm, who took over a Redbirds team that went 22-30 a year ago and led them to a share of the Missouri Valley Conference title. \n",
      " Illinois State made the most of its three hits against Louisville starter Reid Detmers. Joe Aeilts doubled in a run in the first inning and Jeremy Gaines's two-run double in the sixth broke a 2-2 tie. Matt Walker scattered six hits, walked two and struck out seven in a complete game. \n",

      " Dwight Smith Jr.'s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " \"I feel like every time he is around I do something,\" the younger Smith said. \"He's a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.\" \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " \"It's been a rough couple of months,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We've had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.\" \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " \"A great day by the kid,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.\" \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz's ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn't allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " \"It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,\" Cashner said. \"I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.\" \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles' bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year's Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. \"Nothing's really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,\" Elias said. ... The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Orioles: OF Mark Trumbo (knee surgery) had his third rehab assignment for Double-A Bowie. He went 2 for 4 with a strikeout and run. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Giants: Shaun Anderson (0-1, 4.80 ERA) will make his fourth major-league start. He allowed six runs (four earned) and nine hits over five innings in his last outing May 26 against Arizona. \n",
      " Orioles: David Hess (1-6, 6.71 ERA) has not won since carrying a no-hitter into the seventh inning April 1 against Toronto. He has given up a league-leading 18 homers over 11 appearances. \n",

      " % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents. \n",
      " Nick Kingham didn’t get off to much of a start – a single was followed by a triple, then a bouncer that made it 2-0 Brew Crew three batters in. The Bucs managed a two-out rap by Starling but nothing else off Brandon Woodruff. The second went no better with a walk and Orlando Arcia dinger; another walk was left aboard. Eli and Fraze singled with two gone; Nick batted and rolled out. Mike Moustakas hammered a 1-2 curve over the fence to start the third; an infield knock was kept of the scoreboard. Gregory and Starling singled back-to-back with an out, and with two away (a bad relay cost the Brewers a DP and a big inning, as it would turn out), Melky poked one up the middle to plate El Coffee. Redbeard walked to load the sacks, and Eli cleared them when he ripped a slider that hung dead center for a two-bagger to make it 5-4. Fraze was plunked and Bryan Reynolds grabbed a bat; he was walked to load ‘em up again before K-Man lined out to right on a ball that looked like trouble but was snagged by Christian Yelich at the wall. \n",
      " Nick may have seen his last start – Photo Dave Arrigo/Pirates \n",
      " Rookie Davis got the fourth, and gave up an infield knock to Lorenzo Cain for all the Brewer froth. The Pirates went quietly as Woodruff settled down. Rookie stranded a fifth inning double. The Buccos opened with singles from Melky, Redbeard (on a ball that ticked off a glove) and Eli to tie the game. Junior Guerra was waved in and K’ed Fraze, who saw one strike but still couldn’t resist swinging the bat. It got worse before it got better – the runners tried to advance on a ball in the dirt with Jose Osuna hitting, and Eli was nailed at second; the Bucs just gifted Milwaukee two outs. But Joey O provided the better part by banging a two-strike heater off the batter’s eye in center to give the Pirates the lead. Clay Holmes took over in the sixth and walked the first hitter. After a K, he walked another and Frankie came in to face Christian Yelich, who smacked a reviewed homer (looked at fan interference) off a 2-2 fastball to regain the lead for Milwaukee. To rub some salt in the wound, Liriano had gotten him to hit a playable foul pop that Redbeard and K-Man let drop the pitch before. The only Bucco response was a Starling single. \n",
      " Geoff Hartlieb was the seventh inning contestant and walked the second batter, then the third. He survived the wildness to post a zippo. Jeremy Jeffress stepped up to 1-2-3 the Corsairs. Geoff struck out the side in the eighth. Jeffress was tagged for a Tuck two-bagger and infield knock by K-Man, and in came Josh Hader. He fanned Gregory, but his second serve to Starling was sent out of the yard, and it was the Bucco turn as top dog on the seesaw. He struck out the rest of the side and Felipe Vazquez climbed the mound. He bopped Moustakas and paid for it an out later when he tossed a middle-middle fastball to Keston Hiura – it came in at 97 and left the park quicker. The Brewers followed with a double, but The Nightmare kept him at bay. With two away, Fraze got the fans on their feet with a triple off Hader; he had the green light on a 3-0 pitch. Tuck K’ed on three pitches. Kyle Crick got the 10th and bopped Yelich, who stole second and third. A two-out walk left Brew Crew on the corners, but there they stayed. Matt Albers was beckoned. Gregory almost got clubbed one over Cain’s head in center, but no luck for him or the Corsairs. \n",
      " McRae was a strike away – Photo Dave Arrigo/Pirates \n",
      " Alex McRae took the bump in the 11th. He gave up a leadoff knock, got two whiffs, then threw a wild pitch. A walk was followed by another K to put it to bed. J-Bell walked, was bunted up, and then Colin Moran was walked intentionally. Good plan; Eli bounced into a 4-6-3- DP. The windy weather is more threatening than the batters now as McRae fanned two more in a clean 12th. Adrian Houser came in. Fraze singled; Tuck couldn’t bunt him along and fanned instead. It evened out; K-Man walked, and a passed ball moved them up 90′. Gregory was given a free pass. Of course, we know all about Pirates on third with less than two outs…Starling slapped the first ball to third (a knee-high sinker down the middle) for a force at the plate and J-Bell fanned on three pitches; he took the first two. The dam had to break, and with two outs, Milwaukee got a double off a 3-2 fastball and Arcia banged his second homer two pitches later on another heater. Redbeard singled with an out and Eli grounded into another DP to end it. \n",
      " 513 pitches, 32 hits, 14 walks, three hit batters, a wild pitch, a passed ball, 35 whiffs and two big misplays – neither charged as an error – that opened a floodgate for both sides. Closers who couldn’t close. The Brewers used six pitchers; four were scored on. The Bucs used eight; five gave up runs. Though the Buccos hit two dingers, that was the difference in the game – the Brewers banged five. It was entertaining game, but in the end just another loss because too many little things were left undone, and the Pirates aren’t in a position to be giving away games. \n",
      " Notes: \n",
      " Starling had four hits, Fraze and Eli three (although Diaz’s last two at bats ended in GIDPs), and Mlky & Redbeard a pair. Marte has 11 hits in his past five games. \n",
      " K-Man has an 11 game hitting streak. \n",
      " This was the first blown save of the year by Felipe Vazquez. \n",

      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",
      " — Oregon State's Adley Rutschman, batting .420 and the likely No. 1 pick in next week's Major League Baseball draft, was intentionally walked with the bases loaded to pull the Beavers within 5-3 in the seventh inning. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game lead in the AL Central. \n",
      " \"We don't want our guys getting nicked up or anything, but sometimes you take the baserunners any way you can,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"And sometimes it takes a base hit with men on base to kind of wake everyone up and get things going.\" \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",
      " \"It's something we've seen this year. In the games that we have not played our best or lost, we've come back the day after and really pulled together and played good baseball,\" Baldelli said. \"It's what we've come to expect.

      " Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. \n",

Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",

      " Hornets' leadoff hitter Bronson Grubbs singled in his first three at bats and drove in three runs to help Sacramento (40-24) open a 4-0 lead after four innings. \n",

      " They had to wait an extra day, but the Lethbridge Bulls grabbed their first win of the season Friday. \n",
      " The Bulls topped the Fort McMurray Giants 5-1 in seven innings in the first game of a Western Canadian Baseball League doubleheader at Spitz Stadium. \n",
      " Playing their home-opener 24 hours later due to a thunderstorm that washed out Thursday’s game, Bulls designated hitter Ashton Roy uncorked a two-run home in the second inning for a 2-0 lead. \n",
      " The Giants got one back in the fourth inning, but a three-run fifth by the hosts put the game out of reach as the Bulls improve to 1-2. The second game was in progress a press time. \n",
      " On the mound, Bulls starter Ben Erwin pitched into the sixth inning to earn the win as the Bulls return to Spitz Stadium tonight at 7:05 p.m. as the defending champion Medicine Hat Mavericks visit. \n",
      " “It was nice to get the first win at home,” said Bulls head coach Jesse Sawyer. “Benny gave us a good start out there. He’s a strike-thrower and he did his job today. We had a ton of ground balls and we took care of them for the most part. There were a couple in there but we were happy with it. There was some timely hitting when we needed it and (Liam) Sabiston came in and shut the door.” \n",
      " The Bulls grabbed the early lead on Roy’s blast that skipped off the top of the right field wall and out for a 2-0 lead. \n",
      " “He’s an aggressive hitter and he ambushed that fastball early,” said Sawyer. “He’s an energy guy. He keeps the bench up. He’s that kind of guy and he’s always ready to play. That’s exactly what we needed. He loosened everybody up a little bit and we went from there.” \n",
      " Fort McMurray put runners on the corners with one out in the top of the fourth and cut the Bulls head in half when Nick Carlini scored on a passed ball. \n",
      " The Bulls looked poised to pad their lead in the bottom of the fourth inning, loading the bases with one out. \n",
      " However, Giants starter Will Langford rang up Lethbridge’s Brett Mercier and Jaret Semeniuk on strikes to keep it 2-1. \n",
      " A pair of Giants errors in the fifth allowed the Bulls to round out the scoring. \n",
      " Nik Ankermann singled to lead off and advanced to the third on an error. After Riley Jepson walked, Dylan Borman brought them both in on an error to centre field to increase Lethbridge’s lead to 4-1. \n",
      " Borman then scored on a sacrifice fly from Kaleb Warden for a 5-1 lead after five innings. \n",
      " Erwin issued a pair of walks in the sixth to end his night as Sabiston mopped up the rest of the way as the Giants outhit the Bulls 5-4. \n",
      " Borman had the sole multi-hit game for Lethbridge, going 2-for-3 with one run scored and one RBI. Roy’s home run and two RBI were his first of the season. \n",
      " B.J. Minarcin was 2-for-2 for Fort McMurray. \n",
      " Erwin earned the win with six on five-and-one-third innings work, giving up one run on five hits, walking three and striking out five. \n",
      " Sabiston worked the last one and two-thirds innings, walking one and striking out two. \n",
      " Langford was tagged for the loss for the Giants, giving up two runs on three hits, walking two and striking out four. \n",
      " The Mavericks roll into town tonight. \n",
      " “It’s going to be a great game, it’s one of our biggest rivals,” said Sawyer. “We know they’re going to be tough again, but we’re going to be ready to go. We have Griffin on the mound for that game, so we’re excited about that one, too.” \n",

      " The Indians committed four errors. Four of Chicago’s six runs against slumping Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer were unearned. \n",

      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) absorbed a majority of the damage. The veteran right-hander tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Jackson remains winless in four starts with his 14th different team after being acquired in a trade with Oakland on May 11. \n",

      " ST. LOUIS – Matt Carpenter hit a game-ending single against an unusual defensive alignment in the 10th inning, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Cubs, 2-1, on Friday night. \n",
      " The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage in May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). They went 8-18 in May 1980. \n",
      " Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter’s clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team’s only extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game lead in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 consecutive games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season set in 2006. \n",
      " Jose Berrios and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",
      " Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three consecutive days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " Kolarek, a left-hander, relieved to face the left-handed hitting Rosario, and Rosario grounded an opposite-field single to left, past the spot vacated when third baseman Christian Arroyo shifted toward shortstop. \n",
      " Rogers (2-1) retired his first six batters, allowed Daniel Robertson's two-out single in the ninth, then retired Mike Zunino on a groundout. \n",
      " Berrios struck out 8 in 6 2/3 innings, allowing 3 runs and 3 hits. \n",
      " Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. \n",
      " Astudillo had an RBI single in the first, but Kevin Kiermaier's two-run home run in the second put the Rays ahead. Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",

      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing “Bellieve” T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell’s two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise’s 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Archer struck out seven and walked two while needed only 92 pitches to get 21 outs as the injury-ravaged Pirates won for only the third time in their last 11 games. \n",
      " Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command briefly abandoned him in the third inning. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh’s lead to 5-1. Peralta replaced Chacin and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh’s advantage to 7-1. \n",
      " Chacin — a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series — saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " Aguilar hit his first home run in a month when he took Archer to the bushes beyond the center-field wall in leading off the third. Hiura pushed Milwaukee’s home run total to 98 — tops in the National League — with a three-run shot to center in fourth. \n",
      " Hiura had three of Milwaukee’s six hits, but the second baseman was also charged with two of the Brewers’ three errors on a funky play in the seventh when a liner by Jacob Stallings deflected off Peralta’s glove to Hiura, who couldn’t corral it initially, then threw into the Milwaukee dugout when he rushed his throw in an effort to get Stallings. \n",

      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games.

On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",

But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A's their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. \n",
      " Héctor Rondón (3-1) pitched out of a jam in the seventh with help from a diving stop at shortstop by defensive replacement Jack Mayfield that held Ramón Laureano at third base with the infield drawn in. Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 17 chances. \n",

Davis then hit a chopper toward the mound that bounced off Andriese's glove as he reached up. Marte could not handle the ball cleanly as the tying run scored. Gómez followed with a grounder inside the bag at third that drove in Hechavarría, but the ball boy stationed down the line — Arizona uses seniors dubbed \"Golden Glovers\" — fielded the ball thinking it was foul, and Davis was not permitted to score. \n",
      " Zack Wheeler (5-3) struck out nine in seven innings, and Robert Gsellman got three outs for his first save. \n",
      " Arizona lost its fifth straight game, matching a season high. Christian Walker and Ketel Marte homered for the Diamondbacks. \n",

      " PITTSBURGH – Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pittsburgh Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin in a 9-4 victory Friday night. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing “Bellieve” T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell’s two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise’s 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Archer struck out seven and walked two while needed only 92 pitches to get 21 outs as the injury-ravaged Pirates won for only the third time in their last 11 games. \n",
      " Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command briefly abandoned him in the third inning. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh’s lead to 5-1. Peralta replaced Chacin and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh’s advantage to 7-1. \n",
      " Chacin – a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series – saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " Aguilar hit his first home run in a month when he took Archer to the bushes beyond the center-field wall in leading off the third. Hiura pushed Milwaukee’s home run total to 98 – tops in the National League – with a two-run shot to center in fourth. \n",
      " Hiura had three of Milwaukee’s six hits, but the second baseman was also charged with two of the Brewers’ three errors on a funky play in the seventh when a liner by Jacob Stallings deflected off Peralta’s glove to Hiura, who couldn’t corral it initially, then threw into the Milwaukee dugout when he rushed his throw in an effort to get Stallings. \n",

      "  \n",
      " Jun 1, 2019 at 4:18 PM Jun 1, 2019 at 6:14 PM \n",
      " STRONGSVILLE — The record-setting Hillsdale High School baseball team is not settling. \n",
      " After falling behind 2-0 due to a pair of errors in the top of the first inning, Hillsdale bounced back with eight runs in the home half of the inning and four more in the second, going on from there to a 16-2, five-inning dismantling of New Middletown Springfield to capture the program’s first regional championship Saturday afternoon at Strongsville High School. \n",
      " The triumph also vaults Hillsdale to a 27-2 overall mark, setting a record for the most wins in the program’s history. Springfield Local ends its season at 26-4. \n",
      " Hillsdale now enters Division IV state semifinal play for the first time and will play at 4 p.m. Friday at Canal Park in Akron. They will play against the Springfield Regional winner that will be determined in a game Sunday. \n",
      " \"They were confident and hey, we had seven innings to score a bunch,\" said first-year Hillsdale coach Jason Snow of his team’s ability to shake off Springfield’s fast start. \"We got on base early, we got that first one and then (Springfield) unravelled there and our guys took advantage of it.\" \n",
      " An infield throwing error and dropped fly in the outfield led to the pair of first-inning unearned runs off Falcon starter Garrett Goodwin, with Chris Thompson driving in one run with a single for the Tigers. \n",
      " But that didn’t deter Hillsdale from doing what it does best — hitting the ball and getting superb pitching, this time from Goodwin. \n",
      " The Falcons sent 13 batters to the plate in their eight-run first, knocking two of Springfield’s better pitchers off the mound. Thompson, who absorbed the loss and closes his year at 6-1, lasted just 2/3 of an inning, giving up four runs (three earned) on one hit. He was relieved by Drew Clark, who faced five batters but could not get an out and yielded four unearned runs on three hits. \n",
      " Mitchell Seymour eventually got the last out but not before Hillsdale senior Jay Luikart put an exclamation mark on the outburst with a two-run single, after earlier in the frame having doubled. Briar Funk drove in a run with a sacrifice fly, Evan Rottman was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded to plate another and Clay Schoen and Carsten Betson added RBI singles. A pair of Tiger errors also added to their demise. \n",
      " \"We kind of related it from what some of the guys brought up in Myrtle Beach where we had a game where we gave up two home runs right off the bat, it was 2-0 and we responded,\" Snow said. \"A great experience for them to have to do that because we’ve been ahead usually. We’re a patient team and there’s some times I would like to see us be a little more aggressive on those fastballs, but they make them throw strikes and they’re not afraid to have two strikes when they’re up there and we came through in big spots.\" \n",
      " Hillsdale, up 8-2, came up with a four-run second inning. Ty Williams crushed a Seymour offering to right to lead off the inning with a home run. The Falcons scored another run on a wild pitch, and Luikart picked up two more RBIs with a single. He would go 4 for 4 on the day, driving in five runs. \n",
      " \"It was a big game, a lot of pressure so I was just trying to relax and get a good pitch and it worked out well,\" Luikart said. \"The first two at-bats I got ahead in the count and I was able to get a good pitch where they had to throw a strike and I was able to capitalize on that. \n",
      " \"Today, we focused in the batting cage before we came here to get a good pitch to drive and I think everybody, one through nine, did that today and that’s why we put up so many runs and got so many hits.\" \n",
      " Hillsdale added four more runs in the fourth inning as Luikart rapped an RBI single and both Funk and Rottman plated runs with bases-loaded walks. \n",
      " That was was more than enough support for Goodwin, who ran his record to 8-1 on the season by giving up just two hits, both to Thompson, fanning six and not allowing a walk. \n",
      " \"I know early in the game, the first inning, it’s nothing to get worked up over,\" Goodwin said. \"We’ve been a team that’s produced runs all season long so two runs is not a big deal to us. Giving up two runs, it hurts but coming back with an eight spot, all that pressure’s gone and you can just go out there and throw and then continue to put on runs, it’s free and easy out there on the mound.\" \n",
      " \"That was our thing to keep adding on and it really helped ‘G’ to relax and he settled down on the mound and took care of things,\" Snow added. \"He’s very composed. He doesn’t let things rattle him. He dealt with it, moved on, and he threw strikes.\" \n",
      " The team now will focus on completing its final goal of winning a state championship. \n",
      " \"For the last few years, it’s been kind of the same team and we were always young and this year, I always thought we had the talent to make it there, we just never did,\" Luikart said. \"This winter we put in a ton of work and we’re far from where we want to be. We have to win two more games but it’s a big step on the way and a good win. \n",
      " \"Anytime you can represent your school in a way like going to the state, it’s awesome,\" Goodwin added. \"It feels great.\" \n",
      " \"This team is special and these seniors, especially, more than 80 wins in four years,\" Snow praised. \"And for them to be able to break that hump and get to regionals and now move on to state, I’m happy for them.\" \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids - Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",

      " CHICAGO — Dylan Covey pitched six effective innings for his first win since August, and the Chicago White Sox beat the sloppy Cleveland Indians 6-1 Friday for their season-high fifth straight win. \n",
      " Charlie Tilson hit a two-run double to get Chicago’s offence rolling. Tilson, Yoan Moncada, Yonder Alonso and Yolmer Sanchez each had two hits. \n",
      " The win moved the White Sox into a second-place tie in the AL Central with Cleveland. \n",
      " The Indians committed four errors. Four of Chicago’s six runs against slumping Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer were unearned. \n",
      " Covey (1-4) settled down after allowing a leadoff homer to Francisco Lindor. The right-hander scattered eight hits and ended a personal six-game losing streak. \n",
      " Josh Osich and Juan Minaya followed with three innings of one-hit relief. \n",
      " Bauer (4-5) allowed nine hits and struck out eight in seven innings, but shaky fielding doomed the right-hander. An All-Star in 2018, Bauer dropped to 0-4 in six May starts with a 5.75 ERA. \n",
      " Covey, by contrast, was helped by crisp defence. \n",
      " Eloy Jimenez made a leaping catch of Mike Freeman’s fly on the left-field warning track to lead off the third. Jose Abreu speared Greg Allen’s liner near first and then dove back and caught Jake Bauers off the bag for an unassisted double play in the fourth. \n",
      " Lindor’s drive to right-centre was the 15th leadoff homer of his career. \n",
      " Tilson’s ground-rule double with two outs in the third bounced just inside the left-field line and into the stands, giving Chicago a 2-1 lead. \n",
      " The White Sox added three runs, including two unearned, in the fourth. \n",
      " Bauer struck out Moncada with the bases loaded and none out. Abreu followed with a drive to the warning track in straightaway centre for a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " Alonso’s grounder to the right side should have been the third out, but it glanced off Carlos Santana’s glove for an error that allowed two more runs to score. \n",
      " Chicago tacked on another unearned run in the sixth, set up when Tim Anderson reached on Freeman’s throwing error. \n",
      " FIRST HIT \n",
      " White Sox catcher Seby Zavala’s bloop to right in the fourth fell in for his first major league hit. Zavala was recalled from Triple-A last Saturday after Welington Castillo went on the injured list with concussion symptoms. \n",
      " TRAINER’S ROOM \n",
      " Indians: RHP Mike Clevinger (strained upper back muscle) is expected to throw a simulated game at the Indians’ training facility in Arizona on Saturday. … OF Tyler Naquin (left calf strain) is continuing his rehab assignment with Triple-A Columbus and expected to play on Saturday at Durham. … Manager Terry Francona said OF Bradley Zimmer (right shoulder surgery in July 2018), played at Goodyear on Friday and will be re-evaluated on Saturday. The 26-year-old Zimmer could be ready to move to Triple-A in the next phase of his rehab. \n",

      " Indians right-hander Jefry Rodriguez (1-5, 4.99 ERA) faces White Sox right-hander Ivan Nova (3-4, 6.52 ERA) on Saturday afternoon. Rodriguez has been hit hard in losing his last three starts, allowing 14 earned runs over 15 innings for an 8.40 ERA over the span. Nova allowed one run in five innings in a no-decision in his previous start. \n",

      " UNCW converted in the fourth after Brooks Baldwin’s lead-off double. He scored on Noah Liles’ sacrifice fly. It was Liles’ sixth RBI of the season – his fifth came in the 10th inning Sunday to win the Colonial Athletic Association Tournament final against Elon. \n",
      " UNCW starter Zarion Sharpe lasted 4 2/3 innings, giving up three runs on four hits and departing with the bases loaded. He was replaced by Western Alamance alum Breydan Gorham, who struck out Martorano on a called third strike on a full-count pitch. \n",
      " Then Bridges led off the sixth with a solo home run, pulling the Seahawks within 3-2. \n",

      " Colleyville Heritage 3rd baseman Mason Greer (16), center, receives congratulations after scoring in the bottom of the 2nd inning against Lubbock Monterey. The two teams played Game 1 of a best-of-3 Class 5A Region 1 final series at Abilene Christian University's Crutcher Scott Field in Abilene on May 31, 2019. (Steve Hamm/ Special Contributor) \n",
      " By Joseph Hoyt ,                                               Rick Kretzschmar and                                               Randy Jennings \n",
      " Colleyville Heritage's depth and talent makes it dangerous. Sure, the Panthers have possible No. 1 pick Bobby Witt Jr. in the two hole, but they also have at least six other Division I players that opposing teams have to worry about. \n",
      " That depth was on display, once again, during a 6-3 win over Lubbock Monterey on Friday night, putting Colleyville Heritage one win away from its first state tournament. \n",
      " The Panthers scored a combined five runs in the fourth and the fifth to overcome a brief deficit and take Game 1 against Lubbock Monterey at Abilene Christian. \n",
      " Senior Chandler Freeman, a Dallas Baptist signee, led the way for the Panthers, hitting two doubles and recording two RBIs. Fellow Dallas Baptist signee Jakob Berger and New Mexico signee Jacob Guerrero also had RBIs for Colleyville Heritage. Auburn signee Mason Greer, the son of former Texas Rangers outfielder Rusty Greer, reached base three times, scoring every time. \n",
      " RELATED:  Photos: Colleyville Heritage celebrates score, brings the heat on the mound in win over Lubbock Monterey \n",
      " Heritage junior pitcher Colby Kroutil held Monterey in check, allowing seven hits and two runs over five innings. Freeman pitched a scoreless sixth, setting up Witt for the save. \n",
      " Monterey battled back, however, scoring one run and getting the tying run to the plate with two outs. Witt got out of trouble by striking out Gio Adame to end the game. \n",
      " The final inning was one example of Monterey's missed opportunities. The team left eight runners on base against Heritage, the third-ranked team in the state, according to the last state polls, which was released on May 13. \n",
      " Heritage will have at least two chances to earn a trip to the state tournament on Saturday. The Panthers can complete the sweep with a Game 2, which starts at 1 p.m. at Abilene Christian. If Monterey wins, Game 3 will start one hour after the finish of Game 2. \n",

      " Southlake Carroll 8, Flower Mound 5: Trailing 4-0 after just two innings and facing one of the area's top strikeout pitchers, Southlake Carroll's 19-game playoff winning streak appeared to be in jeopardy. \n",
      " Gradually, the defending state champions overcame a sloppy start and started chipping away. \n",
      " Riley Garcia's two-run triple in the fifth inning capped the Carroll comeback and a solid relief pitching performance from Luke Gornell carried the Dragons to an 8-5 victory over Flower Mound and a sweep of the best-of-3 series for Class 6A Region I title Friday night at Dallas Baptist's Horner Ballpark. \n",
      " \"When my bat hit the ball it was probably one of the best feelings I ever had,'' said Garcia, who timed a fastball from the hard-throwing Wallace. \n",
      " Carroll (31-11) improved its season winning streak to 16 and is unbeaten in 20 playoff contests since its last loss in a 2017 state semifinal. The Dragons earned their third consecutive state tournament appearance and ninth overall despite being without any returning starters from last year's state champion. \n",
      " Flower Mound (32-14) survived two previous elimination games in its playoff run, but on this night its potent lineup was limited to six hits. \n",
      " Gornell (4-2), a sophomore, limited Flower Mound to one run on four hits with no walks over the final five innings. \n",
      " \"I wanted to be the guy on the mound when we did it,'' said Gornell. \"It's pretty simple for me, I throw the ball to the target and let my defense work.'' \n",
      " Lefthander Austin Wallace, a Texas signee, lost for only the second time in 13 decisions despite eight strikeouts. \n",
      " Flower Mound's Cam Brown snapped a 4-4 deadlock with a solo home run, his second of the series and sixth of the season, over the left field wall in the top of the fifth. \n",
      " Carroll responded four in the bottom of the inning. Grant Golomb's RBI single tied the score, then Garcia gapped a triple to right second for a 7-5 lead. A balk plated Garcia with the final run. \n",
      " Carroll took Game 1, 8-5, on a three-run homer by Brandon Howell in the sixth inning that snapped a 5-5 deadlock. \n",
      " The game's first eight runs were unearned. \n",
      " Flower Mound capitalized on three Carroll errors to grab a 4-0 lead in the second inning. The only Jaguar hit in the uprising, a Cole Antonelli single, loaded the bases following a hit batsman and the first error. \n",
      " Will Miller after a long at-bat sent a fly ball deep enough to left to score the first run, but Flower Mound got a bonus run when the ball was dropped. One out later when a pickoff throw to first skipped into shallow right, two more Jaguars raced home for a 4-0 score. \n",
      " Wallace escaped unscathed from a bases-loaded jam in the second inning, but wasn't as fortunate in the third when Carroll scratched out a four-run, one-hit inning of its own to level the score. \n",
      " A Yanluis Ortiz leadoff single started the comeback. A walk and a hit batsman loaded the bases. An errant throw to first on Garcia's grounder plated two more. A moment later, a third scored on a wild pitch and the fourth on an errant return throw to the plate. \n",

      " Corsicana vs. Midlothian: Corsicana's baseball team showed a mastery of crisis management on Friday, and because of this it's going someplace it hasn't been since the Eisenhower administration: the state tournament. \n",
      " A two-run single by Hunter Autrey sparked a three-run eighth inning as Corsicana regrouped for a 7-4 win over Midlothian in Game 2 of the Class 5A Region II final baseball series Friday at Dallas Baptist University's Horner Ballpark, concluding a two games to none sweep of the best-of-three series. \n",
      " Corsicana scored two runs in the bottom of the sixth inning to rally for a 2-1 victory in Game 1 earlier Friday as Micah Burke and Devan Lindsey combined for a one-hitter. \n",
      " Corsicana (29-10) advances to the state tournament for the first time since it was the Class 3A state runner-up in 1958, when the Tigers lost to South San Antonio and future University of Texas coach Cliff Gustafson in the title game. Midlothian (26-15), which split two District 14-5A games this season, was denied its first trip to state since 1982. \n",
      " In Game 2 Corsicana regrouped after failing to hold a 4-0 lead, giving up two runs apiece in the sixth and seventh innings, nearly losing it in the seventh. \n",
      " \"We stayed focused in our own heads and doing all the small things. It's what we've done all year, even in a crisis,\" said Autrey, who had two hits in Game 2. \"At the beginning of the year I never thought we would make it this far. It's great.\" \n",
      " UPDATED (5/31): 2019 UIL baseball regional final playoff schedule \n",
      " Game 1 \n",
      " Ty Nolen brought home the winning run when he was hit by Caden Hawkins pitch with two outs. Corsicana tied up the game when pinch hitter Kolby Kincade hit a sacrifice fly to center. \n",
      " Corsicana took advantage of some breaks to score their runs. Lane Fuentes reached base with one out when two Midlothian infielders lost an infield fly in the afternoon sun. Burke followed with an infield single and Luevano walked to load the bases. The inning was extended when Lindsey reached base on a Midlothian fielding error with two outs. \n",
      " Burke (9-3) allowed just one hit over 6⅓ innings for the win, striking out three with one walk. Leaning on precision, the only hit Burke allowed was an infield single by Quinn in the fifth inning. Burke said he changed up strategy after losing to Midlothian 3-1 on April 16. \n",
      " \"They knew I would throw a lot of change-ups. We worked around that and kept them off-balance with more curveballs and fastballs,\" Burke said. \"We try to keep it simple with throwing strikes, and we live painting the corners. \n",
      " \"Going to state for the first time since 1958 ... I'm speechless. This is unreal.\" \n",
      " Josh Tankersley scored Midlothian's run in the first inning, reaching second base on a throwing error, going to third on a wild pitch and scoring on a McCaskill groundout. Quinn reached second on a throw error to open the seventh inning, but Lindsey got two outs in relief to pick up a save for Corsicana, getting a pop up with runners on first and third to end the game. \n",
      " Hawkins (8-6) took the hard-luck loss for Midlothian. Throwing a complete game, Hawkins had four strikeouts while allowing one earned run, four hits and one walk. \n",
      " Game 2 \n",
      " Autrey was set up by a walk from Burke and a double to left by Michael Cuevano. Cade Johnson added a sacrifice fly to left for Corsicana in the eighth. \n",
      " Ryan McCaskill sparked Midlothian's seventh inning with a RBI triple off the right-field wall to cut Corsicana's lead to 4-3. Josh Oliver followed with a one-out sacrifice fly to left, but on the play Corsicana caught courtesy runner Austen Thomas in a rundown between second and third base to end the inning. Lance Rains and Hunter Rainwater had back-to-back, two-out RBI singles for Midlothian in the sixth inning. \n",
      " Corsicana extended its lead to 3-0 in the third inning with RBI singles from Lindsey and Caydon Rash. In the fourth inning Burke scored what turned out to be an important insurance run off a wild pitch. \n",
      " Lindsey (7-1) pitched 1⅔ innings in relief for the win and also went 3-for-3 at the plate with a double. Caden Copeland (2-2) took the loss in relief, giving up the winning runs in the eighth after throwing 4⅔ shutout innings in relief of starter Jackson Quinn. McCaskill went 2 for 3 at the plate.. \n",

      " Defending national champion Oregon State was among the first teams eliminated from the NCAA Tournament on Saturday, marking the first time the Beavers have gone 0-2 in regionals in 14 appearances since 1985. \n",
      " The Beavers’ 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton, which followed a 7-6 loss to American Athletic Conference champ Cincinnati on Friday, knocked them out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",
      " Baylor’s Shea Langeliers turned in one of the greatest individual postseason performances, hitting three home runs and doubling while going 5 for 6 and driving in a tournament-record 11 runs in the Bears’ 24-6 win over Omaha in an elimination game. \n",
      " “It’s a pretty cool,” Langeliers said. “It’s a team accolade. I was up in the right situations and happened to come through.” \n",
      " Langeliers’ homers were for two, one and three runs. He also had a two-run single and three-run double. \n",
      " Illinois State sprung a surprise by beating No. 7 national seed Louisville 4-2 on the Cardinals’ home field to move within one win of making its first super regional. \n",
      " No.  4 regional seeds Central Connecticut State, Jacksonville State and Ohio State won elimination games to stay alive. \n",
      " Creighton’s Evan Johnson and John Sakowski combined on a four-hitter, Isaac Collins homered in a three-run third inning and three errors led to two unearned runs for the Bluejays, who bounced back from a 6-0 loss to Michigan. \n",
      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman’s last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " Illinois State continued its surge under first-year coach Steve Holm, who took over a Redbirds team that went 22-30 a year ago and led them to a share of the Missouri Valley Conference title. \n",
      " Illinois State made the most of its three hits against Louisville starter Reid Detmers. Joe Aeilts doubled in a run in the first inning and Jeremy Gaines’s two-run double in the sixth broke a 2-2 tie. Matt Walker scattered six hits, walked two and struck out seven in a complete game. \n",

      " AP \n",
      " Pirates starting pitcher Nick Kingham delivers during the first inning of the team’s baseball game against the Brewers on Saturday, June 1, 2019. \n",
      " AP \n",

      " 22 minutes ago \n",
      " They overcame an early five-run deficit and took the lead from down two runs in the eighth inning. But that only made Saturday that much tougher to swallow for the Pittsburgh Pirates. \n",
      " Orlando Arcia hit his second homer of the game in the 13th inning, and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Pirates, 12-10. \n",
      " Arcia turned on an Alex McRae two-seamer – the 499th pitch of the game – and struck it 103.8 mph, driving it 413 feet into the bullpens in left-center with Hernan Perez aboard to lift Milwaukee to a long, wild win. \n",
      " It was Arcia’s eighth home run of the season, and it capped the fourth lead change after Milwaukee took a 5-0 advantage through 2½ innings against beleaguered starter Nick Kingham. The Pirates answered with seven consecutive runs until reigning National League MVP Christian Yelich hit a three-run homer in the sixth inning. \n",
      " Then, after Starling Marte put the Pirates ahead again with a three-run homer off Brewers closer Josh Hader in the eighth, Felipe Vazquez suffered his first blown save in 15 opportunities this season when Keston Hiura hit a two-run homer to left off of him. \n",
      " The Pirates allowed another double-digit score from an opponent, the fifth over the past 10 games. It was another reminder of the Pirates’ pitching issues after they had the highest ERA in the majors (6.19) during May. \n",
      " Josh Bell went 0 for 6 (albeit with a walk and a run) after he wrapped up one of the most productive months in baseball history the previous night. \n",
      " Arcia’s multihomer game was his first — he hit one off Kingham with Eric Thames aboard in the second. Kingham was charged with five runs on six hits and two walks in three innings. The game lasted 5 hours, 23 minutes and had 32 hits and 24 men left on base. It featured 14 pitchers. Every Pirates reliever except for Richard Rodriguez got into the game. McRae (0-1) threw 63 pitches. \n",
      " The Pirates had a chance to win it in the bottom of the 12th when they loaded the bases with one out and Marte (4 for 6 to that point) and Bell (the hottest hitter in baseball) due to bat. But Marte chopped into a force play at home, and Bell struck out on three pitches. \n",
      " Saturday, only Rookie Davis and Geoff Hartlieb (two scoreless innings each) had clean stat lines among six Pirates pitchers. Clay Holmes walked two of the three batters he faced in the sixth, Francisco Liriano relieved and served up the Yelich home run (though he was harmed by Colin Moran and Kevin Newman misplaying a foul pop-up on the prior pitch) and Vazquez blew his first save since last September. \n",
      " Jose Osuna hit a pinch-hit home run, and Melky Cabrera went 2 for 4 with two runs for the Pirates (28-29), who are assured of their fourth consecutive nonwinning series regardless of what happens in the finale with Milwaukee on Sunday. They also fell below .500. \n",

      " Tiger Woods' challenge at the Memorial tournament in Ohio suffered a blow in the second round on Friday with a late double bogey that left him seven strokes off the lead while Justin Rose shot a best of the day 63 to haul himself back into contention. \n",
      " Jordan Spieth remained a stroke off the lead with a 70, with Troy Merritt (66), South Korea's Lee Kyoung-hoon (67) and German Martin Kaymer (68) tied at the top on eight-under 135. Woods overcame a shaky start to make three birdies before putting up a seven at the par five 15th en route to an even par 72. \n",
      " \"I didn't really get anything going today,\" Woods told reporters. \"I was just kind of plugging along. \n",
      " \"All of us were watching Rosie get things going on the front nine.\" \n",
      " After opening with a 75, Rose, who played with Woods, turned his day around by going 10-under in a 12-hole stretch that included two eagles and six birdies. He finished the day three shots off the lead on six-under 138. \n",

      " The Seminoles (37-21) have made the tournament all 40 years they've been coached by Mike Martin, who is retiring after the season, and 42 in a row overall. They need three more wins to extend their streak of winning at least 40 games every season under Martin, the all-time wins leader in all NCAA sports. \n",
      " Michigan and Duke, also among the last four in, got huge pitching performances. The Wolverines' Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings in a 6-0 win over Creighton. Ben Gross gave the Blue Devils seven strong innings in an 8-5 win over Texas A&M. \n",
      " Matt Wallner, Danny Lynch and Storme Cooper homered and combined for 10 RBIs and Southern Mississippi exploded for a 12-run fifth inning in a 15-3 win over Arizona State.

      " “That’s what we went … when returning guys come in and contribute, the way guys like Will do is great.” \n",
      " Spearing pitched four strong innings before his fifth and final one saw his only mistake of the game. \n",
      " He pitched a strong fifth inning before he loaded the bases and surrendered his first earned runs of the season on a Prospect double. \n",
      " Dawgs Academy alumnus Andrew Yates was called upon to settle the momentum. \n",
      " He got the first out on a pop fly against his first batter but couldn’t save the lead after a sac fly tied the \n",
      " game at three apiece. \n",
      " Yates however, kept the game tied thanks to a huge pick-off that led to an inning ending run-down play that caught the third Prospect runner stealing a base in just six innings. \n",
      " “He’s a proven guy. I know I can trust him and needed him at home before anything else. Brunner stepped in and trusted Billy at the end and we got it,” Sergent said on the strong effort from the bullpen. \n",
      " Okotoks responded on a bunt single from Valcke with a runner on base that the Prospects infield made an error on, allowing for a run to get cashed in from second base. \n",
      " Valcke was counted for the fifth run of the game on a Gavin Logan fielders choice that capped off the sixth inning. \n",
      " A late game fielder choice led to the Prospects’ fourth run of the game that forced relief pitcher Galan Manhard out of the game for closer Brand. \n",
      " Brand held his own at the top of the ninth, having one runner on second base with no outs but the Point University senior didn’t crack and retired his next three batters. \n",
      " The Dawgs stay at home and welcome the Fort McMurray Giants Saturday with first pitch set for 7:05 p.m. \n",

      " Gregory Bull, ASSOCIATED PRESS \n",
      " SAN DIEGO (AP) — Three solo home runs were enough to power the San Diego Padres past the Miami Marlins. \n",
      " View all (5) \n",
      " Franmil Reyes, Hunter Renfroe and Ian Kinsler homered, and left-hander Joey Lucchesi combined with two relievers on a four-hitter for his first victory in six starts to lead the San Diego Padres to a 5-2 victory Friday night. \n",
      " \"We thrive with the long ball and we've got the guys who can hit them,\" manager Andy Green said. \"You have to embrace who you are. We've got a lot of slug as a club. It's nice when you get guys on base and hit two- and three-run homers, but solos did it today.\" \n",
      " Lucchesi certainly enjoyed the power display. \n",
      " \"I love it. I love when guys hit them,\" the big lefty said. \"It makes them feel good, it makes us feel good. It's great.\" \n",
      " Lucchesi (4-3) hadn't won since beating Cincinnati at home on April 21. He retired his first seven batters before allowing a double by Miguel Rojas in the third. He then retired eight straight before allowing a home run by pinch-hitter Rosell Herrera with one out in the sixth. Lucchesi struck out five and walked one. \n",
      " Craig Stammen pitched 1 2/3 hitless innings, Phil Maton allowed two singles to open the Marlins' ninth and Kirby Yates came on to get the final three outs for his 22nd save, best in the majors. \n",
      " Herrera was pinch-hitting for lefty Caleb Smith (3-3), who lost his third straight decision after allowing two runs and three hits in five innings. He struck out eight and walked two. \n",
      " \"I thought he threw the ball really well,\" manager Don Mattingly said. \"Gives up the two solos, but I think we saw the finish that we talked about before, more swing and miss. Definitely a lot better out of Caleb tonight.\" \n",
      " The Padres \"don't really chase too far out of the zone,\" Mattingly said. \"They've got swing and miss but they don't chase all over the place, so there were a lot of deep counts and you've got to make pitches, so we know they're dangerous from that standpoint.\" \n",
      " Reyes homered on a line shot to left with one out in the first, his 16th. Renfroe hit a moonshot into the second balcony on the Western Metal Supply Co. Building in the left-field corner with one out in the fourth for his 15th. \n",
      " \"I felt like my stuff was pretty good,\" Smith said. \"Just made a couple mistakes and I've got to stop giving up the long ball.\" \n",
      " Kinsler homered off Austin Brice with one out in the seventh for his seventh. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Marlins: Placed 1B Neil Walker on the 10-day injured list with a strained right quad and recalled INF JT Riddle from Triple-A New Orleans. \n",
      " Padres: Manager Andy Green said rookie SS Fernando Tatis Jr. could begin a rehab assignment next week, depending on how he fares in extended spring games this weekend. He has been out since straining his left hamstring on April 28. \n",

      " share url email fbmsngr whatsapp sms \n",
      " BALTIMORE (AP) — Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the center field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles . \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.’s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " “I feel like every time he is around I do something,” the younger Smith said. “He’s a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.” \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " “It’s been a rough couple of months,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “We’ve had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.” \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " “A great day by the kid,” Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. “He’s done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.” \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith’s grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz’s ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn’t allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " “It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,” Cashner said. “I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.” \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles’ bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year’s Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. “Nothing’s really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,” Elias said. … The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",

      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The Minnesota Twins are a hit — and getting hit. \n",
      " Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and the Twins beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-3 Friday night in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game lead in the AL Central. \n",
      " \"We don't want our guys getting nicked up or anything, but sometimes you take the baserunners any way you can,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"And sometimes it takes a base hit with men on base to kind of wake everyone up and get things going.\" \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",
      " \"It's something we've seen this year. In the games that we have not played our best or lost, we've come back the day after and really pulled together and played good baseball,\" Baldelli said. \"It's what we've come to expect. I think we have the type of guys that regardless of what happens today, they'll be ready to play tomorrow.\" \n",
      " Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " The Twins have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. They trailed 3-1 in the fifth before Polanco drove in a run with his second double and scored on a single by Willians Astudillo. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout. Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo plunked Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " Kolarek, a left-hander, relieved to face the left-handed hitting Rosario, and Rosario grounded an opposite-field single to left, past the spot vacated when third baseman Christian Arroyo shifted toward shortstop. \n",
      " Rogers (2-1) retired his first six batters, allowed Daniel Robertson's two-out single in the ninth, then retired Mike Zunino on a groundout. \n",
      " Berríos struck out eight in 6 2/3 innings, allowing three runs and three hits. \n",
      " Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. \n",
      " Astudillo had an RBI single in the first, but Kevin Kiermaier's two-run homer in the second put the Rays ahead. Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",
      " Astudillo was thrown out at the plate by Kiermaier while trying to score on C.J. Cron's two-out double to center. \n",
      " SCARY \n",
      " Rays pitcher Emilio Pagán was hit on the right cheek by a line drive off Schoop's bat in the sixth but remained in he game. \n",
      " \"I was lucky,\" Pagan said. \"Probably my No. 1 fear, most pitchers will agree, that a ball coming back at you is not a fun situation to be in. It could have gotten me on my hand a lot more serious, and it definitely could have hit me in the face a lot harder.\" \n",
      " SHORT BENCH \n",
      " Tampa Bay played with C Travis d'Arnaud as the only healthy backup. Outfielders Tommy Pham (right leg cramp) and Avisail Garcia (overall body soreness/hamstrings) were limited to pinch hitting. \n",

      " Twins: Polanco was at DH after missing Thursday's game due to illness. \n",
      " Rays: C Zunino (strained left quadriceps) was reinstated from the 10-day IL and C Erik Kratz was designated for assignment. ... INF Yandy Díaz (bruised left hand) was sent to extended spring training. ... INF Matt Duffy, out all season with a strained left hamstring, said a specialist he saw this week found no structural damage. Duffy could resume jogging Monday. \n",

      " BATON ROUGE, La. (WDAM) - A fly ball that became a home run by the width of outfield wall padding and a handrail set off Friday afternoon one of the more remarkable offensive displays in University of Southern Mississippi baseball history. \n",
      " Shortstop Storme Cooper led off the top of the fifth inning with his first home run of the season and fourth of his career, not only tying the game but setting off a 12-run scoring spree as the Golden Eagles went on to bury Arizona State University 15-3 at Alex Box Stadium in the opening game of the Baton Rouge (La.) Regional. \n",
      " Third-seeded USM (39-19) will meet host and top-seeded Louisiana State University (38-24) at 6 p.m. Saturday. The Tigers won Friday’s nightcap 17-3 over Stony Brook University. \n",
      " Second seeded ASU (37-18) will face fourth-seeded Stony Brook (31-22) in an elimination game at noon Saturday. \n",
      " Cooper, who had just seven hits during the regular season, was one of three Golden Eagles with two hits in an inning that saw USM send 15 batters to the plate, mash nine hits, knock ASU ace Alec Marsh from the game and open NCAA Regional play with a victory for the fourth consecutive year. \n",
      " “Pleased the way our guys showed up on a hot day to go out and compete,” USM coach Scott Berry said. “if you look at the body of work, you can’t help but notice the 12 runs that were scored in the fifth inning. \n",
      " “Before that, in the third, we missed an opportunity with runners at first and second and nobody out and the top of the order up and we did not get any runs. But (starting pitcher) Gabe Shepard went back out did what he had to do to keep the momentum with us. Very proud of his outing (Friday).” \n",
      " Shepard, who tossed 7 1/3 innings of no-hit ball in his last outing in the semifinal round of the 2019 Conference USA baseball tourney, shut down one of the country’s top offenses on two runs and six hits over 5 2/3 innings. \n",
      " He struck out four and walked three. \n",
      " “I had a ton of confidence going out there, just they believed in me and trusted me to go out there and get the job done. \n",
      " “I feel like my teammates have confidence in me, and that makes me feel good, going out there and knowing they have my back.” \n",
      " Shephard (3-0) allowed a run for the first time in three starts, when Arizona State center fielder Hunter Bishop singled to lead off the bottom of the fourth inning, moved to second on an infield dribbler, went to third base on a wild pitch and scored on catcher Lyle Lin’s sacrifice fly. \n",
      " But after USM had managed just three hits over the first four innings, Cooper led off the fifth by turning a 3-2 offering from Marsh (9-4) into a fly ball to left field that just cleared the top of the wall, bouncing off the backside of the railing and into the first rows of the bleachers. \n",
      " “It’s been a while,” said Cooper, whose last home run came against Old Dominion University in 2017. “I felt like we were playing with a lot of emotion, and I got the guys fired up.” \n",
      " That hit indeed seemed to open the floodgates, as the baseball gods donned black-and-gold for the next 20 minutes or so. \n",
      " Montenegro ripped a first-pitch double into the left-center field gap before Matt Guidry smoked a line drive into the glove of Spencer Torkelson at first base for the inning’s first out. \n",
      " Hunter Slater coaxed a walk off Marsh and Matt Wallner lined a single off the wall past diving right fielder Carter Aldrete to score Montenegro for a 2-1 USM lead. \n",
      " After a strikeout for the second out, Marsh uncorked a pair of wild pitches. The first scored Slater for a 3-1 USM lead and sent Wallner to second. The second put Wallner on third. \n",
      " Cole Donaldson walked and Fred Franklin followed with a seeing-eye single into right field for a 4-1 lead. \n",
      " That ended Marsh’s day and brought in reliever Blake Burzell, who did not retire any of the four batters he faced. \n",
      " Danny Lynch greeted him with a flyball that plopped just inside the foul line for a double that scored Donaldson for a 5-1 lead. \n",
      " Cooper then hustled down the line to beat out an infield single that scored both Donaldson and Lynch for a 7-1 lead. \n",
      " Montenegro was generously credited with a single into the hole, ending Burzell’s day and bringing in Erik Tolman, who promptly walked Guidry to load the bases. \n",
      " Slater slipped a single into right field, scoring Cooper and Montenegro for a 9-1 bulge and Wallner followed with his 22nd home run of the season, a three-run blast that nearly cleared the outfield bleachers in right-center field. \n",
      " That capped the largest inning in USM baseball annals since the Golden Eagles scored 13 runs in the fifth inning against the University of Houston on March 24, 2012. \n",
      " “What did they get? Ten runs with two outs?” asked Arizona State Tracy Smith. “One ball hits the line, one beats the shift, the others creep through. It’s just one of those innings. I don’t know if you have a description for it, other than they put balls in play (Friday) and found holes. \n",
      " “We weren’t kicking it around. Outside maybe a walk, we weren’t really giving it to them. Give credit to them. They put the bat on the ball and found the space. Sometimes that happens and you just can’t shut it off.” \n",
      " Indeed. Lynch added his own three-run homer in the eighth inning, and USM logged five hits over the final four innings. All told, USM racked up 17 hits and scored the fourth-most runs by a USM team in a regional game and the most sine a 19-6 win over Jacksonville State in the 2010 Auburn Regional. \n",
      " “It helps when you get into a rhythm as an offense,” said Wallner, who is a home run shy of tying USM’s single-season record shared by four others. “That is how we were in the fifth inning. It made it easy just to go up to the plate and have a solid approach.” \n",
      " Spotted an 11-run lead, Guidry worked a 1-2-3 fifth inning, but then couldn’t get out of the bottom of the sixth. \n",
      " Torkelson led off the inning with his 22nd homer of the year, and, eventually, the Sun Devils had runners on first and second with two outs and Guidry at a 2-0 count and 112 pitches. \n",
      " Guidry was relieved by Sean Tweedy, who finished the walk to Aldrete to load the bases, but then struck out Cole Austin to end the inning. \n",
      " J.C. Keys worked two scoreless, walking one on the seventh inning only to roll a double-play grounder. He then struck the next four men he faced over the seventh and eighth innings. \n",
      " ASU added a run in the ninth inning off Mason Strickland on a pinch-hit single by Nick Cheema. \n",
      " Cooper and Lynch each had three hits for the Golden Eagles. Cooper drove in a season-high three runs and scored twice, while Lynch drove in four runs and scored twice. \n",
      " Wallner, Franklin, Montenegro and Slater had two hits apiece, while Montenegro, Slater, Wallner and Cole Donaldson scored two runs each. \n",
      " The Sun Devils finished with eight hits, with third baseman Gage Workman coming up with two singles. \n",
      " Freshman Danny Lynch tacked on three runs with a two-out, three-run home run in the top of the eighth to give Southern Miss a 15-2 lead. \n",
      " Keys returned to the mound in the eighth inning and struck out the side. Mason Strickland came on for Southern Miss to close out the ninth inning, allowing one run before ending the game on a double play. \n",
      " Cooper finished the day with three hits and four RBI, while Wallner contributed two hits and four RBI. Lynch finished with three hits and four RBI. \n",

      " LOS ANGELES (AP) — Max Muncy, Joc Pederson, Corey Seager and Enriquè Hernàndez homered, powering the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 6-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday night in the opener of a series matching the National League’s two best teams. \n",
      " The West-leading Dodgers improved to a major league-best 23-7 at home and have won 11 of their last 15 at Chavez Ravine against the East-leading Phillies. \n",
      " The Dodgers’ 39 victories lead the NL. \n",
      " They rapped out 12 hits while limiting the Phillies to five, two of which came in the ninth. \n",
      " Kenta Maeda (7-2) allowed two runs and three hits in six innings and won his fourth straight start. The right-hander struck out six and walked none. \n",
      " Kenley Jansen earned his 17th save, striking out pinch hitter Andrew Knapp in the ninth, the only batter he faced. \n",
      " Muncy and Seager belted two-run shots and Pederson had a solo homer off Jake Arrieta (5-5), who gave up five runs and 10 hits in five innings. The right-hander struck out three and walked one in the ballpark where Arrieta pitched his first career no-hitter in 2015 with the Cubs. \n",
      " Philadelphia’s Bryce Harper, Andrew McCutchen and Rhys Hoskins combined to go 2 for 12. Harper came in batting .346 in his previous 13 games. \n",
      " Muncy’s 20th homer gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead and scored Pederson, who singled leading off the third. \n",
      " McCutchen’s homer leading off the fourth made it 2-1. \n",
      " The Phillies tied the game 2-all in the fifth on Arrieta’s RBI single. \n",
      " Pederson led off the bottom of the fifth with his 17th homer, the first of four consecutive hits given up by Arrieta. Muncy followed with a single before he scored on Seager’s two-run shot that landed in the corner of the right field pavilion, making it 5-2. \n",
      " Cody Bellinger followed with a single before Arrieta got three straight outs to end the inning. \n",
      " Hernàndez extended the Dodgers’ lead to 6-2 with a solo homer on the first pitch from Juan Nicasio in the seventh. \n",
      " TRAINER’S ROOM \n",
      " Phillies: RHP Zach Eflin went on the IL with mid-back tightness and will miss his scheduled start Saturday. He’s not expected to be out long. … RHP Victor Arano (right elbow) is 2-3 months from returning after having his elbow scoped Tuesday. \n",
      " Dodgers: 3B Justin Turner (right hamstring tightness) missed his second straight game, although he worked out on the field during batting practice. \n",
      " MISSING SKIPPER \n",
      " Dodgers manager Dave Roberts missed the game to attend his son’s high school graduation, leaving bench coach Bob Geren to run the team. Cole Roberts played shortstop and second base at private Santa Fe Christian School in Solana Beach, north of San Diego. He has committed to Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles. The elder Roberts also celebrated his 47th birthday Friday. \n",
      " FANS IN THE STANDS \n",
      " The announced attendance of 54,307 was the largest regular-season crowd at Dodger Stadium since 2012 and the team’s sixth sellout of the season. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Phillies: They had yet to name a starter for Saturday after putting RH Zach Eflin on the IL with mid-back tightness. \n",
      " Dodgers: LH Clayton Kershaw (5-0, 3.46) will be facing Harper, who is 2 for 21 with 13 strikeouts against him. \n",

      " The second day of NCAA regionals brought an early exit for the defending national champion, one of the greatest individual performances in tournament history and an upset of No. 1 national seed UCLA. \n",
      " Oregon State was eliminated on its home field with a 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton on Saturday, marking the first time the Beavers have gone 0-2 in regionals in 14 appearances since 1985. They were knocked out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",
      " \"It was a matter of us not playing good baseball. That's the bottom line,\" OSU interim coach Pat Bailey said. \n",
      " The Beavers lost 10 of their last 15 games and finished 36-20-1 a season after they completed a two-year run in which they won 111 of 130 games under former coach Pat Casey. \n",
      " Sports Videos \n",
      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman's last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " Baylor's Shea Langeliers hit three home runs and doubled while going 5 for 6 and driving in a tournament-record 11 runs in a 24-6 win over Omaha in an elimination game. \n",
      " \"When I was a little kid, I liked to think I was a pretty good hitter, but I think this game will probably be one of the most meaningful games for me as a hitter probably for the rest of my career,\" Langeliers said. \"Our backs were up against the wall and we needed a big game from our offense and we got it. It was a lot of fun.\" \n",
      " Langeliers, who likely will be the second catcher drafted behind Rutschman, broke the NCAA postseason record of 10 RBIs in a game shared by Vanderbilt's Connor Kaiser (2018) and Miami's Kevin Brown (2001). \n",
      " Langeliers' homers were for two, one and three runs. He also had a two-run single and three-run double. \n",
      " Hours after Langeliers' big performance, Loyola Marymount beat UCLA 3-2 on the same field in Los Angeles. The Lions lost twice to the Bruins in the regular season and had dropped seven in a row against them. \n",
      " Cooper Uhl, LMU's 9-hole batter, sent a run-scoring single into right field in the seventh inning to break a 2-2 tie. Nick Frasso earned his second save in two days, striking out three in two shutout innings. \n",

      " FSU is a win away from super regionals in Mike Martin's 40th and final season. The Seminoles, a No. 3 regional seed for the first time under Martin and one of the last four teams selected for the tournament, have scored 25 runs in two games. \n",

      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row.

      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",

      " PITTSBURGH — Milwaukee Brewers starter Jhoulys Chacin’s command failed him in the third inning Friday night. And it proved costly. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the inning, three of them with the bases loaded during a 9-4 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. \n",
      " Chacin’s woes included a five-pitch walk to Pirates starter Chris Archer that pushed Pittsburgh’s lead to 5-1. Freddy Peralta replaced Chacin and Kevin Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh’s advantage to 7-1 and drop Chacin (3-7) to 1-7 in his past 10 starts. \n",
      " Chacin — a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series — saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2⅔ innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " “I just lost my focus in that inning,” Chacin said. “That never happened to me before, walking guys with the bases loaded like that. I need to start to do a better job if I want to keep pitching.” \n",
      " Something that might not be guaranteed. Asked if Chacin might need a break, Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said only: “We’ve got to figure out how to get him pitching the way he’s capable of.” \n",
      " Slugger Josh Bell had two of Pittsburgh’s 13 hits — all singles. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. His 94 total bases during the month are the most by any Pirate in any month ever. Heady territory considering Pittsburgh started playing baseball a century — and then some — before Bell was born. \n",
      " “I feel like I’m just riding the wave,” Bell said. \n",
      " One that doesn’t appear close to cresting. \n",
      " Bell’s total base mark broke Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner’s record of 92 set in June, 1947. Bell is also one of only three players in NL history to have 12 home runs and 12 doubles in the same month, joining Hall of Famers Frank Robinson and Hank Aaron. \n",
      " × \n",
      " {{featured_button_text}} \n",
      " “He pushes himself,” Archer (2-5) said of Bell after picking up his first victory since April 7. “If he gets out, he’s mad. He’s hitting .340 and he’s angry that he’s got out, which continues to keep him motivated. He’s not content. We’ve got four months left in the season and I expect to see big things from him going forward.” \n",
      " Bell didn’t provide any big blasts Friday night, but contributed to a flood of small ones as the Pirates won for just the fourth time in 11 games. Starling Marte had three hits and scored three times and Newman went 2-for-5 with two RBIs to extend his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games. \n",
      " Archer had seven strikeouts with two walks in seven innings. He gave up a solo home run to Jesus Aguilar in the third and a three-run shot to Keston Hiura in the fourth but settled down afterward. \n",
      " “I’m going to stay relentless,” Archer said. “I’ve been doing this a long time. I’m not going to let (a slump) define me.” \n",
      " From the infirmary \n",

      " Brewers righty Brandon Woodruff (7-1, 3.22 ERA) will look for his seventh straight win on Saturday. Woodruff entered the season with five career victories spread across 2017 and 2018. He limited the Phillies to one run in eight innings on Sunday. \n",
      " The Pirates’ Nick Kingham (1-1, 8.28) hasn’t won a game as a starter since last July. Kingham — who has bounced between the bullpen and the rotation this season — allowed three runs in 4⅔ innings against Cincinnati on Monday. \n",

      " Gallo's 1st career grand slam leads Rangers past Royals \n",
      " Updated: Fri 10:43 PM, May 31, 2019 \n",
      " ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Joey Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth inning outburst as the Texas Rangers rallied past the Kansas City Royals 6-2 Friday night. \n",
      " Gallo's home run, his team leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet and landed in the second seating area beyond the center-field wall. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. Jurado allowed two runs on five hits and three walks. The second-year right-hander, who was recalled from Triple-A Nashville on April 26, had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks — both in the sixth. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. \n",
      " Texas loaded the bases in the sixth inning on outfield singles by Shin-Soo Choo and Elvis Andrus and a chopper hit between third base and the mound by Hunter Pence. Duffy fielded Pence's grounder, but his throw to first base was late. \n",
      " Duffy walked Nomar Mazara with the bases loaded to tie the score 2-2. Gallo then launched a 1-1 fastball to end a six-game homerless streak, which matched his longest this season. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Cuthbert, who earlier Friday had his contract selected from Triple-A Omaha, hit an opposite-field homer that just cleared the right-field wall in the second. \n",
      " Gordon's triple in the fifth inning turned around centerfielder Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway center, scoring  Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. \n",
      " The Royals lead the majors with 24 triples. \n",
      " Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base. That gave the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",
      " PRE-GAME MOVES \n",
      " To make room for Cuthbert, the Royals designated INF-OF Chris Owings for assignment. The Rangers selected the contract of RHP David Carpenter from Nashville and optioned OF Zack Granite to Nashville. \n",

      " Royals: OF Hunter Dozier (right thorax tightness) is day to day, leaving Thursday's game in the fifth inning and sitting out Friday. \n",

      " Seattle Mariners' Jay Bruce celebrates in the dugout after hitting a solo home run off Los Angeles Angels starting pitcher Tyler Skaggs during the seventh inning of a baseball game Friday, May 31, 2019, in Seattle. \n",
      " Stephen Brashear \n",
      " Save \n",
      " SEATTLE (AP) — Jay Bruce has accomplished a lot in 10 seasons in the major leagues. On Friday night, he experienced his own beer shower for the first time. \n",
      " Bruce hit his 300th career home run to join a fairly exclusive group, Tom Murphy hit a two-run shot, and the Seattle Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels 4-3. \n",
      " \"You know, a personal beer shower, that's probably my first one,\" Bruce said. \"It's good. Cold — it's very cold. If you had told me I was going to hit my 300th home run playing first base for the Seattle Mariners, I probably would have called you crazy.\" \n",
      " Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce, who was an outfielder for much of his career, became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles (he's got 301), achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a root canal) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. \n",
      " The win snapped the Angels' three-game winning streak and wasted a fairly strong start by Tyler Skaggs (4-5), who struck out eight and gave up just five hits but made a handful of costly mistakes while giving up four runs in seven innings. \n",
      " Skaggs' first mistake came a few pitches after Murphy doubled off the top of the wall in the third inning for the Mariners' first hit. Home plate umpire Lance Barksdale called a balk on Skaggs and sent Murphy to third. He easily scored on Dylan Moore's single for a 1-0 lead. \n",
      " Skaggs messed up again in the fifth when he walked Bruce with two outs. Murphy then homered to right field for a 3-0 lead. \n",
      " \"It's extremely frustrating,\" Skaggs said. \"I thought I was really, really good and the results didn't show up. But at the same time, a lot of positives today. I really, really felt like it was the best I looked this year and (I want to) keep it rolling into the next one.\" \n",
      " The Angels briefly got to Mike Leake (4-6) in the sixth inning when Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani hit back-to-back home runs to left field with two outs. It was the first time Los Angeles has hit consecutive home runs this season, but it wasn't enough for the Angels. \n",
      " Leake was otherwise flawless. He retired 14 of the first 15 batters he faced, didn't issue a walk against two strikeouts and scattered five hits in seven innings. He didn't allow a base runner other than Trout and Ohtani past first base. \n",
      " Servais thought it was Leake's best game in quite some time. \n",
      " \"Mike's a feel guy and he was feeling the breaking ball all night,\" he said. \n",
      " The Mariners' bullpen again struggled after Leake left. Reliever Austin Adams walked two players after starting the eighth with a popout. Servais went to Jesse Biddle, who allowed Ohtani to single in a run to cut the lead to 4-3. Biddle followed by walking Kole Calhoun to load the bases. Anthony Bass came on and induced a fly ball to end the threat and pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to earn his first save. He's one of seven Seattle relievers with at least one save this season. \n",
      " The Mariners, league leaders in errors, also got pristine defense with Murphy picking off a runner and Mitch Haniger making a diving catch in right field in the seventh, and Kyle Seager snatching up a slow roller barehanded in the ninth with a snap throw. Bass finished off the game with a strikeout. \n",
      " \"Bass really picked us up tonight,\" Servais said. \"He hasn't been with the ballclub very long but I like what he does. He doesn't' give in.\" \n",
      " BRUCE'S BALL \n",
      " Bruce hopes to get his home run ball back from the fan who caught it Friday night. He managed to track down home runs No. 100 and No. 200 after he hit them as well. \n",
      " \"Honestly, I couldn't tell you where those are right now, but they're in my house,\" Bruce joked. \n",

      " Angels: Reliever John Curtiss was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake City and RHP Jake Jewell was optioned to make room a day after he pitched 2 2/3 innings of scoreless relief against the Mariners. The team also designated RHP Matt Ramsey for assignment. Ausmus would not confirm that minor leaguer Jose Suarez will start Sunday's game in Seattle in place of regular starter Trevor Cahill, who will be pushed back a day. \n",
      " Mariners: Servais sat down with LHP Yusei Kikuchi on Friday, a day after his second straight difficult start. The two talked over how the Japanese rookie felt and how he might be used going forward. Kikuchi could make another abbreviated start of one inning next week or he could be pulled for one spin of the rotation. That decision will probably come Saturday. \n",
      " Seattle continued to tinker with its bullpen Friday, recalling RHP Chasen Bradford from Triple-A Tacoma. He's had 10 major league relief appearances this season with one save and one hold. The Mariners optioned David McKay back to Tacoma to make room. \n",

      " Defending champ Beavers upset; No. 3s open 12-3 in regionals \n",
      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids - Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",
      " - Oregon State's Adley Rutschman, batting .420 and the likely No. 1 pick in next week's Major League Baseball draft, was intentionally walked with the bases loaded to pull the Beavers within 5-3 in the seventh inning. \n",
      " - Dallas Baptist knocked out Florida starter Tommy Mace after 1 1/3 innings and collected 17 hits against four pitchers in an 11-8 win. \n",
      " - Aaron Schunk hit two of Georgia's three home runs and had five RBIs in a 13-3 win over Mercer. \n",
      " - Florida State's Mike Salvatore had four of his team's 20 hits and Drew Mendoza joined Becker in homering twice against FAU. \n",
      " - Auburn 8-hole hitter Steven Williams had four hits, including a three-run homer, and five RBIs against Coastal Carolina. \n",
      " - Tristin English went 4 for 4 with five RBIs to lead Georgia Tech past Florida A&M 13-2. \n",

      " ATHENS — Florida State head coach Mike Martin's NCAA Tournament farewell tour got off to a momentous start Friday as the Seminoles' offense pounded out a season-high 20 hits, including six home runs, en route to a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic in the opening game of the Athens Regional at Foley Field. \n",
      " The No. 3-seeded Seminoles (37-21) now will await the Georgia-Mercer winner in Saturday's 7 p.m. winner's bracket game. The No. 2 seeded Owls will get the Georgia-Mercer loser at noon on Saturday in the first elimination game. \n",
      " Tim Becker and Drew Mendoza each hit two home runs and drove in four runs in the first meeting between the two Sunshine State schools since 1998. \n",
      " “That was certainly something that we did not expect,\" said Martin, whose group had lost three of five coming into the playoffs. \"Today was one of those days where everything went right for us early. These two young men to my right [Mendoza & Becker] came up big in the RBI department and that is what we look at as competitors in getting it done in run scoring situations. This was certainly helped by a little wind, but who cares. That is called baseball.” \n",
      " Martin, who is retiring after the season, has led the Seminoles to a tournament appearance in each of his 40 seasons. He has 16 CWS appearances but is still looking for his first championship. \n",
      " Reese Albert and J.C. Flowers also hit homers for the Seminoles. Drew Parrish (8-5) allowed five runs in five innings to get the win. \n",
      " For the Owls (40-20) Bobby Morgensen had three hits, including two homers, and Joe Montes also went deep in a game that saw a brisk wind blowing out of Foley Field. \n",
      " Florida Atlantic head coach John McCormack said the key was on the mound, where they needed six pitchers to get the 27 outs. Blake Sanderson (8-3) allowed six runs, four earned, in five innings. He gave up three homers after allowing only nine in the regular season. \n",
      " \"You know, it’s an offensive game. It’s no secret we needed to pitch better,\" McCormack said. \"We just have to pitch better. I think we only threw two zeros, maybe three zeros, in a in a nine-inning game, and it's too much to keep chasing.\" \n",
      " The Seminoles broke a scoreless tie with a five-run second inning. After the Owls trimmed the lead to 6-3 in the fifth, both teams traded two-run frames in the sixth and seventh innings before Florida State put it out of reach with a three-run ninth. \n",

      " Arizona lost its fifth straight game, matching a season high. Christian Walker and Ketel Marte homered, but the Diamondbacks were unable to hold on after taking a 4-3 lead. \n",
      " Frazier and Hechavarria sparked New York's winning rally with consecutive two-out singles off Matt Andriese (3-4), putting runners on first and third. \n",
      " Pinch hitter J.D. Davis then hit a chopper toward the mound that bounced off Andriese's glove as he reached up. Marte could not handle the ball cleanly as the tying run scored. \n",
      " Gómez followed with a grounder inside the bag at third that drove in Hechavarría, but the ball boy stationed down the line — Arizona uses seniors dubbed \"Golden Glovers\" — fielded the ball thinking it was foul, and Davis was not permitted to score. \n",

      " Marte opened the inning with his 13th homer. Adam Jones singled with one out, and Walker connected for a 447-foot drive into the second deck of the left field bleachers. Walker finished with three hits and two RBIs after going 4 for 34 on Arizona's 10-game trip that ended Thursday. \n",
      " Wheeler gave up seven hits and walked one. He also hit his second double of the season and raised his batting average to .321. Jeff McNeil is the only Mets' regular with a higher average at .333. \n",
      " The Mets scored three runs in the second inning, during which play was halted for several minutes when plate umpire Jim Wolf was forced to leave after being struck by a foul ball in the mask. \n",
      " Michael Conforto led off with a walk against Jon Duplantier in the pitcher's first major league start. Ramos singled before Wolf left during Frazier's at-bat. When play resumed, Frazier dumped an RBI single into center and Hechavarria doubled to center for a 3-0 lead. \n",

      " DENVER -- After hitting two homers and driving in a career-high seven runs in the Rockies’ sixth straight victory, 13-6 over the Blue Jays at Coors Field, Trevor Story found it cool to acknowledge May -- one that was poor offensively before turning boiling hot -- before flipping the calendar. \n",
      " “This game so repetitive and monotonous that a month can go by and you didn’t realize that May just went by,” Story said. “We’re going to ride this feeling that we have now and try to extend that as long as we can.” \n",
      " • Box score \n",
      " Story powered the Rockies’ attack on Friday night with a pair of two-run home runs and a bases-clearing double in the third innings, giving him a career-high seven RBIs. He went 3-for-4 with a walk and four runs scored. \n",
      " The Rockies’ 183 runs were their most in any month since scoring 173 in August 2016. They also led the Majors in May in batting average (.294), and topped National League clubs in slugging percentage (.516) and on-base percentage (.359). Plus, Nolan Arenado, who registered three hits and drove in three runs on Friday and Story called “the rock of the lineup,” batted an unreal .425. Colorado went 16-10 and ended the month by scoring 81 runs in its last 11 games. \n",
      " But the true story of May for the Rockies, believe it or not, is one of overcoming empty offense. \n",
      " In eight of Colorado’s first 14 games of the month, it finished with double-digit strikeouts. There was the frigid, strange May 14 night in Boston when the Rockies fanned 24 times -- 17 against Red Sox ace Chris Sale -- but pulled out a 5-4 victory. \n",
      " But by the time Colorado was swept in three games in Philadelphia, with Aaron Nola fanning a career-high 12 and the Rockies making it a baker’s dozen in the middle game of the series, they had lost four straight, dropping to five games below .500. That led to a strikeout summit. \n",
      " “We had a meeting in Philly where we addressed it,” said Story, who tied former Brewer J.J. Hardy for most home runs (15) before June 1 for a shortstop in NL history. “There are different kinds of strikeouts -- ones that are a little more acceptable and ones that are big no-nos in certain spots. It’s been a team effort. Collectively, we’ve grinded on that and tried to really cut down on those. \n",
      " “We feel the best teams, the best offenses, they don’t strike out like that. We knew we had it in us, but seeing it being done is nice.” \n",
      " As the Rockies head into June, Arenado is on an 11-game hit streak. Raimel Tapia, who scored a career-high four runs, has a 10-game streak. Heck, starter German Marquez (6-2), who struck out seven and held the Blue Jays to two runs over seven innings, has a five-game streak -- the most by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton’s eight-gamer from July 22-Aug. 29, 2002. The right-hander went 2-for-3 against Toronto. \n",
      " Arenado is hitting .344, David Dahl .318, Tony Wolters .303 and Story .294. Charlie Blackmon -- who hasn’t played since last Thursday with a right calf injury -- is at .300. Ian Desmond was batting .140 through April 14 but has hit .297 since to pull his season mark to .250. \n",
      " And the only time the Rockies have reached double digits in K’s over the past eight games was Thursday, but that game took 11 innings and was won thanks to an RBI single by Daniel Murphy, who slumped after returning from a finger injury but has gotten hot of late. \n",
      " “We’re swinging at strikes, taking balls,” Rockies manager Bud Black said. “Our strikeout rate the last couple weeks has gone down. Our walk rate has gone up. Guys are swinging a little bit more freely. They’re swinging aggressive early in the count at good pitches to hit. They’re fighting with two strikes, putting the ball in play. \n",
      " “These things add up to a good offense.” \n",

      " PITTSBURGH – Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pittsburgh Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin in a 9-4 victory Friday night. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing “Bellieve” T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBI. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Archer struck out seven and walked two. He needed only 92 pitches to get 21 outs as the Pirates won for only the third time in their last 11 games. \n",
      " Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command briefly abandoned him in the third inning. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh's lead to 5-1. Peralta replaced Chacin, and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh's advantage to 7-1. \n",
      " Chacin – a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series – saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 22/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high, and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " Aguilar hit his first home run in a month when he took Archer to the bushes beyond the center-field wall in leading off the third. Hiura pushed Milwaukee's home run total to 98 – tops in the NL – with a three-run shot to center in fourth. \n",

      " The Gators eliminated Army from the NCAA Lubbock Regional with a 13-5 win Saturday. Florida (34-25) will play another elimination game at 3 p.m. Sunday against the loser of Saturday evening’s late winner’s bracket game between Texas Tech and Dallas Baptist. Army (35-26) saw its season come to an end after going 0-2 in the regional. \n",
      " Jack Leftwich took a perfect game into the sixth inning, Kendrick Calilao hit one of four Florida homers while driving in five runs and the Gators cruised past Army. \n",
      " Josh White homered off Leftwich (6-5) with one out in the sixth to end the bid for a perfect game and shutout. The sophomore right-hander allowed only White’s homer and a walk with seven strikeouts in seven innings. \n",

      " Army was swept in a regional for the third time in four appearances since losing in the final round at Texas in 2009. The Golden Knights have lost four straight tournament games by a combined score of 47-9. \n",

Meanwhile, the offense continued to produce with 14 hits — including four home runs — and the defense did not commit an error. \n",
      " “Kendrick obviously had a big day at the plate with five RBIs and Wil (Dalton) had a good day,” O’Sullivan said. “I thought Brady McConnell had a good day, even though he didn’t get any hits. He hit the ball hard quite a few times. So all in all it was a very good day for us offensively, pitching-wise and defensively.” \n",

      " Navigators add Swampscott’s Louis Olivieri to 2019 roster By Joshua Kummins | April 3, 2019 \n",
      " WORCESTER– The North Shore Navigators broke out the bats for the second consecutive night, posting 14 hits en route to a 12-4 win over the Worcester Bravehearts Friday at a sold-out Hanover Insurance Park. \n",
      " Following Thursday’s season-opening 9-8 win in Brockton, the Navs improved to 2-0 for the first time since 2013. \n",
      " Four North Shore batters recorded multiple hits and four recorded multiple RBI as part of the impressive offensive performance. Catcher Nolan Watson (Dayton) went 4-for-6 with two runs scored out of the leadoff spot, while third baseman Tyler MacGregor (Columbia) went 3-for-5 and drove in four runs for his second consecutive multi-hit game. \n",
      " Pitching minutes from his hometown of Auburn, rising Northeastern freshman Jake Gigliotti earned the win in his North Shore debut. He struck out six and allowed just two hits and one walk through 4 2/3 innings of relief. \n",
      " North Shore began the night with back-to-back hits from Watson and shortstop Andrew Olszak (Southern Maine) before right fielder Ben Malgeri (Holy Cross) was hit by a pitch to load the bases. The Navs scored when left fielder Sean Lawlor (Flagler) hit a sacrifice fly to center and extended their lead on MacGregor’s two-run single through the middle. \n",
      " The Bravehearts got a run back in their half of the first against North Shore starter Cedric Gillette (Merrimack) as center fielder John Thrasher (Hartford) drew a leadoff walk and scored on designated hitter Jack Gardner (Cypress) grounder to short two batters later. \n",
      " The visitors added to their lead with three runs over the fourth and fifth innings. Designated hitter Colin Macko (UNC Asheville) led off the former frame with a solo home run to right field. In the fifth, catcher Louis Olivieri (Central Alabama CC) hit a sacrifice fly that scored Malgeri and MacGregor added his second run-scoring hit of the game with a two-out single to left. \n",
      " Gillette had retired 12 consecutive batters following Thrasher’s leadoff walk, but the Bravehearts scratched across three runs on just one hit in the fifth. The Andover native hit two batters and walked two others to bring home a run before left fielder Jakob Sessa (St. Petersburg) sent Worcester’s first hit of the game into left with one out. \n",
      " After allowing Gillette’s inherited runners to score, Gigliotti settled down and struck out back-to-back Bravehearts with the bases loaded to keep North Shore ahead by two runs. \n",
      " Watson led off North Shore’s four-run eighth with a triple and scored on Freeberger’s two-run single into shallow right four batters later. In the following at-bats, Olivieri added a RBI grounder to third and MacGregor brought home the team’s 10th run with a single to center. \n",
      " The Navs added two hits in the ninth with Lawlor’s one-out single driving home a run. Gigliotti allowed a leadoff walk in the home half, but a 4-6-3 double play and his final strikeout ended the game. \n",
      " Sessa and P.J. Barry (St. Leo) were the lone Worcester hitters. Jakob Barker (Seminole State) allowed six hits and four runs during his four-inning start for the Bravehearts, while five pitchers threw out of the bullpen over the final five frames. \n",

      " Dwight Smith Hits 1st Grand Slam, Orioles Beat Giants 9-6 \n",
      " By The Associated Press \n",
      " May 31, 2019 \n",
      " BALTIMORE — Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the center field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.'s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " \"I feel like every time he is around I do something,\" the younger Smith said. \"He's a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.\" \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " \"It's been a rough couple of months,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We've had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.\" \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " \"A great day by the kid,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He's done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.\" \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz's ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn't allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " \"It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,\" Cashner said. \"I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.\" \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles' bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year's Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. \"Nothing's really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,\" Elias said. ... The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Orioles: OF Mark Trumbo (knee surgery) had his third rehab assignment for Double-A Bowie. He went 2 for 4 with a strikeout and run. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Giants: Shaun Anderson (0-1, 4.80 ERA) will make his fourth major-league start. He allowed six runs (four earned) and nine hits over five innings in his last outing May 26 against Arizona. \n",
      " Orioles: David Hess (1-6, 6.71 ERA) has not won since carrying a no-hitter into the seventh inning April 1 against Toronto. He has given up a league-leading 18 homers over 11 appearances. \n",

      " NEW YORK (AP) — DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",
      " Rafael Devers homered early for the third-place Red Sox, who fell 8½ games back in the division. That's the furthest they've been behind the Yankees since finishing the 2015 season nine games in the dust. \n",
      " PIRATES 9, BREWERS 4 \n",
      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " NEWSLETTERS \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",
      " REDS 9, NATIONALS 3 \n",
      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",
      " Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto's 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. \n",
      " Cincinnati's Joey Votto returned after missing three games with a tight right hamstring and had three hits. Eugenio Suarez was back in the lineup after getting hit on the left hand by Clay Holmes' pitch on Wednesday. \n",
      " TWINS 5, RAYS 3 \n",
      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking, two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and Minnesota beat Tampa Bay in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",

      " DENVER (AP) — Trevor Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and the Colorado Rockies beat the slumping Toronto Blue Jays for their sixth straight win. \n",
      " It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. \n",
      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",
      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. \n",

But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double.

Gómez followed with a grounder inside the bag at third that drove in Hechavarría, but the ball boy stationed down the line — Arizona uses seniors dubbed \"Golden Glovers\" — fielded the ball thinking it was foul, and Davis was not permitted to score. \n",

      " Will Smith's first career home run is a walk-off in the Dodgers' win over the Phillies \n",
      " By Jorge Castillo \n",
      " Jun 01, 2019 | 10:05 PM \n",

      " The ball bounced off Will Smith’s bat and went skyward. It stayed in the air, refusing to drop, and it kept going and going and going down the left-field line, until it finally did. When it did, it landed a few rows deep into the seats, next to the Dodgers’ bullpen, and the Dodgers had their second walk-off win in four days, a 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. \n",
      " It was the first career home run for Smith, a rookie called up for the majors for the first time at the beginning of the week. And it salvaged Los Angeles from more late-inning bullpen trouble. \n",
      " Advertisement \n",
      " The Dodgers were holding a 3-1 lead in the eighth inning when Bryce Harper, the recipient of boos every time his name has been announced at Dodger Stadium the past two nights, spoiled Clayton Kershaw’s outing and knotted the game with a two-run blast off Julio Urias. It continued Urias’s sudden struggles out of the bullpen. After giving up two home runs in his first 30 ⅓ innings, Urias has given up three in his last two outings. The left-hander has allowed four runs on five hits in five innings since coming off administrative leave following his arrest on suspicion of domestic battery May 13. \n",
      " The 95th and final pitch Kershaw fired Saturday was, at once, a display of his recent limitations and remaining elite ability. \n",
      " There was a runner at second base -- Scott Kingery had cracked a leadoff double -- and Kershaw was an out away from wiggling free from danger in a one-run game. The pitch was the seventh in a battle with pinch-hitter Sean Rodriguez. It was a fastball clocked at 91 mph, far from the velocity most pitchers require for success, but it was in on the hands, perfectly placed, and it induced a swing-and-miss for strike three. \n",
      " Kershaw pumped his fist. A raucous roar pulsated the ballpark. The process was different, but the results were what the onlookers have come to expect for over a decade. Kershaw completed his night having allowed one run on six hits across seven innings. He fanned six batters without issuing a walk. \n",
      " The run he surrendered came after third baseman Max Muncy, making his third straight start at third for the injured Justin Turner, committed an error on Rhys Hoskins’s groundball in the fourth inning. What could’ve been an inning-ending double play ended up with J.T. Realmuto smacking an RBI single. \n",
      " David Freese batted leadoff in a regular season game for the fourth time in his 11-year big-league career Saturday. It was a strategy prompted by the Phillies using left-hander Jose Alvarez as an opener. Freese, a right-handed batter who mashes left-handers, was positioned to counter Alvarez as many times as possible but flied out in his only plate appearance before Alvarez was pulled. \n",
      " His second at-bat came in the third inning against a right-hander, Juan Nicasio, who was put in the game just to counter Freese. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts elected to stick with Freese. He grounded out, but the Dodgers tallied the game’s first run later in the inning on Enrique Hernandez’s RBI single. Roberts’s decision to keep Freese in the game paid dividends in the fifth inning when Freese launched a leadoff home run off left-hander Cole Irvin to give the Dodgers a 2-1 lead. \n",
      " Los Angeles widened the gap in the seventh inning on Muncy’s sacrifice fly. The run proved pivotal minutes later once Harper blasted a fastball from Urias over the wall in left-center field. \n",

      " Bell caps historic month in style, Pirates top Brewers 9-4 \n",
      " By \n",
      " May 31, 2019 \n",
      " 22 \n",
      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pittsburgh Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin in a 9-4 victory Friday night. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing “Bellieve” T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell’s two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise’s 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Archer struck out seven and walked two while needed only 92 pitches to get 21 outs as the injury-ravaged Pirates won for only the third time in their last 11 games. \n",
      " Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command briefly abandoned him in the third inning. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh’s lead to 5-1. Peralta replaced Chacin and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh’s advantage to 7-1. \n",
      " Chacin — a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series — saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " Aguilar hit his first home run in a month when he took Archer to the bushes beyond the center-field wall in leading off the third. Hiura pushed Milwaukee’s home run total to 98 — tops in the National League — with a three-run shot to center in fourth. \n",
      " Hiura had three of Milwaukee’s six hits, but the second baseman was also charged with two of the Brewers’ three errors on a funky play in the seventh when a liner by Jacob Stallings deflected off Peralta’s glove to Hiura, who couldn’t corral it initially, then threw into the Milwaukee dugout when he rushed his throw in an effort to get Stallings. \n",
      " TRAINER’S ROOM \n",
      " Brewers: C Manny Pina (right hamstring discomfort) is expected to rejoin Milwaukee over the weekend. Pina is hitting .300 (3 for 10) during a rehab stint with Class A Wisconsin entering Friday. \n",
      " Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles (left hamstring discomfort) will start Sunday’s series finale. Lyles exited a loss to Cincinnati last Tuesday after tweaking the hamstring in the fourth inning. … RHP Keone Kela will be shut down for 10 days after the right shoulder discomfort that sent him to the injured list popped back up during a rehab assignment. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Brewers: Brandon Woodruff (7-1, 3.22 ERA) will look for his seventh straight win on Saturday. Woodruff entered the season with five career victories spread across 2017 and 2018. He limited the Phillies to one run in eight innings last Sunday. \n",
      " Pirates: Nick Kingham (1-1, 8.28) hasn’t won a game as a starter since last July, but will get the nod on Saturday. Kingham — who has bounced between the bullpen and the rotation this season — allowed three runs in 4 2/3 innings against Cincinnati on Monday. \n",

      " ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Joey Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth inning outburst as the Texas Rangers rallied past the Kansas City Royals 6-2 Friday night. \n",
      " Gallo's home run, his team leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet and landed in the second seating area beyond the center-field wall. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. Jurado allowed two runs on five hits and three walks. The second-year right-hander, who was recalled from Triple-A Nashville on April 26, had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks - both in the sixth. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. \n",
      " Texas loaded the bases in the sixth inning on outfield singles by Shin-Soo Choo and Elvis Andrus and a chopper hit between third base and the mound by Hunter Pence. Duffy fielded Pence's grounder, but his throw to first base was late. \n",
      " Duffy walked Nomar Mazara with the bases loaded to tie the score 2-2. Gallo then launched a 1-1 fastball to end a six-game homerless streak, which matched his longest this season. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Cuthbert, who earlier Friday had his contract selected from Triple-A Omaha, hit an opposite-field homer that just cleared the right-field wall in the second. \n",
      " Gordon's triple in the fifth inning turned around centerfielder Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway center, scoring Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. \n",
      " The Royals lead the majors with 24 triples. \n",
      " Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base. That gave the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",
      " PRE-GAME MOVES \n",
      " To make room for Cuthbert, the Royals designated INF-OF Chris Owings for assignment. The Rangers selected the contract of RHP David Carpenter from Nashville and optioned OF Zack Granite to Nashville. \n",

      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",

      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout. Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo plunked Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",

Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",

      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Tanner Roark's first career homer wasn't enough to get the win against his former Nationals teammates. Instead, it went to the other half of the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " \"A weird day,\" Nationals starter Eric Fedde said. \n",
      " Except for the outcome. Nothing surprising about the Nationals winning in Cincinnati. \n",

      " \"I felt like my emotions were under control,\" said Roark, who went six innings. \"It's definitely a tough loss. The bunt and the home run felt good. I would've rather have won the game.\" \n",
      " Two homers made the difference. \n",
      " Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 36 2/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Rainey (1-1), who got into the game in the fifth. He acknowledged that he had extra motivation facing his former team, and he fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. \n",
      " \"For me getting the first win in here, it is special,\" Rainey said. \n",

      " BALTIMORE --  If the San Francisco Giants had more games like this, Bruce Bochy would have far more reason to smile during his final season as a big league manager. \n",
      " Backed by timely hitting and an error-free defense, San Francisco starter Shaun Anderson stuck around for seven innings and earned his first big league win , an 8-2 rout of the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday. \n",
      " Brandon Belt drove in four runs and Buster Posey homered for the Giants, who built a 7-1 lead in the fifth and cruised to only their second win in 10 games. The Giants came in ranked last in the NL with a .221 batting average and had scored as many as seven runs only once in their previous 19 games. \n",
      " \"We moved guys over. We hit guys in,\" Bochy said. \"We played the game well today.  It was a nice crisp game for us.\" \n",
      " Bochy said in February that this would be his last season, and to this point it's hardly been one to savor. San Francisco is in last place, owns the fourth-worst ERA in the NL and hasn't had a winning streak of more than three in a row. \n",
      " The starting pitching has generally been ineffective, but Anderson's performance provided a ray of hope. \n",
      " The rookie right-hander allowed two runs and five hits over seven innings in his fourth big league start. Anderson (1-1) ended a run of 40 consecutive starts of fewer than seven innings by Giants pitchers -- the team's longest such streak in the last 100 years. \n",
      " \"He just pitched well. It was good to see that,\" Bochy said. \"The pen needed a big break today. He allowed us to do that.\" \n",
      " Obtained in a 2017 trade that sent Eduardo Nunez to Boston, the 24-year-old Anderson pitched in seven games at the Triple-A level this year before making his debut with San Francisco on May 15 against Toronto. His previous three starts with the Giants each were five innings. \n",
      " \"Honestly, I felt good,\" he said. \"I pride myself on going into the seventh inning. This is what I prepared for.\" \n",
      " San Francisco scored all its runs off David Hess (1-7). Since throwing 6 1/3 innings of no-hit ball in Toronto on April 1, Hess has gone 0-7 over 10 starts. \n",
      " \"The biggest thing is just not falling behind in the count,\" the right-hander said. \"When I was ahead in the count it obviously made pitching a lot easier.\" \n",
      " Belt had a two-run single in the first inning and doubled in two runs during a four-run fifth. Posey ended a run of 50 at-bats without a homer by going deep to right in the third. \n",
      " Renato Nunez hit his 15th home run for Baltimore, the eighth in 12 games. \n",
      " The Orioles were without manager Brandon Hyde, who was attending his daughter's graduation in Illinois. Hyde was replaced by Tim Cossins, the team's field coordinator and catching instructor. \n",
      " \"It was an unbelievable experience,\" said Cossins, whose last managerial gig was in the Florida State League around 2005. \"It's something I'll look back on forever and appreciate.\" \n",
      " POMERANZ TO BULLPEN \n",
      " Struggling Giants lefty Drew Pomeranz (1-6, 8.08 ERA) will likely miss at least one start after surrendering eight runs in 1 1/3 innings against the Orioles on Friday night. With an off day Monday, Bochy will shuffle his rotation and send Pomeranz to the bullpen. \"He could help us Sunday, if we needed it,\" Bochy said. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Giants: Posey tweaked his right hamstring and will be rested Sunday. ... Pitching coach Curt Young was hospitalized Friday night to have his knee drained of infection. He will remain hospitalized through the weekend. ... RHP Trevor Gott (right forearm strain) should be ready to come off the IL on Tuesday, Bochy said. \n",
      " Orioles: OF-1B Mark Trumbo , who's recovering from right knee surgery, was 3 for 13 with a double in three rehab games with Double-A Bowie through Friday. He has yet to play consecutive days. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Giants: Jeff Samardzija (2-4, 3.83 ERA) works the finale Sunday after losing his previous three starts. The righty hasn't faced the Orioles since 2015, when he was with the White Sox. \n",
      " Orioles: Gabriel Ynoa (0-1, 5.40) makes his second start since being inserted into the rotation for struggling Dan Straily . Ynoa allowed two runs in four innings against Detroit on Monday. \n",

      " And yet he’s doing plenty. \n",

      " “We do have a good lineup,” said manager Bud Black, whose team’s 183 runs in May is tied for the fourth-most for a month in team history. “I think it’s deep. It has speed. It has power. It has average.” \n",
      " For a change, Colorado didn’t have to fret late in the game after jumping out to an early 10-2 lead. The Rockies have four walk-off wins in going 7-1 so far on this season-high, 10-game homestand. \n",
      " Pirates 9, Brewers 4: Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and host Pittsburgh pounced on Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin.

      " BATON ROUGE, La. (WDAM) - A fly ball that became a home run by the width of outfield wall padding and a handrail set off Friday afternoon one of the more remarkable offensive displays in University of Southern Mississippi baseball history. \n",
      " Shortstop Storme Cooper led off the top of the fifth inning with his first home run of the season and fourth of his career, not only tying the game but setting off a 12-run scoring spree as the Golden Eagles went on to bury Arizona State University 15-3 at Alex Box Stadium in the opening game of the Baton Rouge (La.) Regional. \n",
      " Third-seeded USM (39-19) will meet host and top-seeded Louisiana State University (38-24) at 6 p.m. Saturday. The Tigers won Friday’s nightcap 17-3 over Stony Brook University. \n",
      " Second seeded ASU (37-18) will face fourth-seeded Stony Brook (31-22) in an elimination game at noon Saturday. \n",
      " Cooper, who had just seven hits during the regular season, was one of three Golden Eagles with two hits in an inning that saw USM send 15 batters to the plate, mash nine hits, knock ASU ace Alec Marsh from the game and open NCAA Regional play with a victory for the fourth consecutive year. \n",
      " “Pleased the way our guys showed up on a hot day to go out and compete,” USM coach Scott Berry said. “if you look at the body of work, you can’t help but notice the 12 runs that were scored in the fifth inning. \n",
      " “Before that, in the third, we missed an opportunity with runners at first and second and nobody out and the top of the order up and we did not get any runs. But (starting pitcher) Gabe Shepard went back out did what he had to do to keep the momentum with us. Very proud of his outing (Friday).” \n",
      " Shepard, who tossed 7 1/3 innings of no-hit ball in his last outing in the semifinal round of the 2019 Conference USA baseball tourney, shut down one of the country’s top offenses on two runs and six hits over 5 2/3 innings. \n",
      " He struck out four and walked three. \n",
      " “I had a ton of confidence going out there, just they believed in me and trusted me to go out there and get the job done. \n",
      " “I feel like my teammates have confidence in me, and that makes me feel good, going out there and knowing they have my back.” \n",
      " Shephard (3-0) allowed a run for the first time in three starts, when Arizona State center fielder Hunter Bishop singled to lead off the bottom of the fourth inning, moved to second on an infield dribbler, went to third base on a wild pitch and scored on catcher Lyle Lin’s sacrifice fly. \n",
      " But after USM had managed just three hits over the first four innings, Cooper led off the fifth by turning a 3-2 offering from Marsh (9-4) into a fly ball to left field that just cleared the top of the wall, bouncing off the backside of the railing and into the first rows of the bleachers. \n",
      " “It’s been a while,” said Cooper, whose last home run came against Old Dominion University in 2017. “I felt like we were playing with a lot of emotion, and I got the guys fired up.” \n",
      " That hit indeed seemed to open the floodgates, as the baseball gods donned black-and-gold for the next 20 minutes or so. \n",
      " Montenegro ripped a first-pitch double into the left-center field gap before Matt Guidry smoked a line drive into the glove of Spencer Torkelson at first base for the inning’s first out. \n",
      " Hunter Slater coaxed a walk off Marsh and Matt Wallner lined a single off the wall past diving right fielder Carter Aldrete to score Montenegro for a 2-1 USM lead. \n",
      " After a strikeout for the second out, Marsh uncorked a pair of wild pitches. The first scored Slater for a 3-1 USM lead and sent Wallner to second. The second put Wallner on third. \n",
      " Cole Donaldson walked and Fred Franklin followed with a seeing-eye single into right field for a 4-1 lead. \n",
      " That ended Marsh’s day and brought in reliever Blake Burzell, who did not retire any of the four batters he faced. \n",
      " Danny Lynch greeted him with a flyball that plopped just inside the foul line for a double that scored Donaldson for a 5-1 lead. \n",
      " Cooper then hustled down the line to beat out an infield single that scored both Donaldson and Lynch for a 7-1 lead. \n",
      " Montenegro was generously credited with a single into the hole, ending Burzell’s day and bringing in Erik Tolman, who promptly walked Guidry to load the bases. \n",
      " Slater slipped a single into right field, scoring Cooper and Montenegro for a 9-1 bulge and Wallner followed with his 22nd home run of the season, a three-run blast that nearly cleared the outfield bleachers in right-center field. \n",
      " That capped the largest inning in USM baseball annals since the Golden Eagles scored 13 runs in the fifth inning against the University of Houston on March 24, 2012. \n",
      " “What did they get? Ten runs with two outs?” asked Arizona State Tracy Smith. “One ball hits the line, one beats the shift, the others creep through. It’s just one of those innings. I don’t know if you have a description for it, other than they put balls in play (Friday) and found holes. \n",
      " “We weren’t kicking it around. Outside maybe a walk, we weren’t really giving it to them. Give credit to them. They put the bat on the ball and found the space. Sometimes that happens and you just can’t shut it off.” \n",
      " Indeed. Lynch added his own three-run homer in the eighth inning, and USM logged five hits over the final four innings. All told, USM racked up 17 hits and scored the fourth-most runs by a USM team in a regional game and the most sine a 19-6 win over Jacksonville State in the 2010 Auburn Regional. \n",
      " “It helps when you get into a rhythm as an offense,” said Wallner, who is a home run shy of tying USM’s single-season record shared by four others. “That is how we were in the fifth inning. It made it easy just to go up to the plate and have a solid approach.” \n",
      " Spotted an 11-run lead, Guidry worked a 1-2-3 fifth inning, but then couldn’t get out of the bottom of the sixth. \n",
      " Torkelson led off the inning with his 22nd homer of the year, and, eventually, the Sun Devils had runners on first and second with two outs and Guidry at a 2-0 count and 112 pitches. \n",
      " Guidry was relieved by Sean Tweedy, who finished the walk to Aldrete to load the bases, but then struck out Cole Austin to end the inning. \n",
      " J.C. Keys worked two scoreless, walking one on the seventh inning only to roll a double-play grounder. He then struck the next four men he faced over the seventh and eighth innings. \n",
      " ASU added a run in the ninth inning off Mason Strickland on a pinch-hit single by Nick Cheema. \n",
      " Cooper and Lynch each had three hits for the Golden Eagles. Cooper drove in a season-high three runs and scored twice, while Lynch drove in four runs and scored twice. \n",
      " Wallner, Franklin, Montenegro and Slater had two hits apiece, while Montenegro, Slater, Wallner and Cole Donaldson scored two runs each. \n",
      " The Sun Devils finished with eight hits, with third baseman Gage Workman coming up with two singles. \n",
      " Freshman Danny Lynch tacked on three runs with a two-out, three-run home run in the top of the eighth to give Southern Miss a 15-2 lead. \n",
      " Keys returned to the mound in the eighth inning and struck out the side. Mason Strickland came on for Southern Miss to close out the ninth inning, allowing one run before ending the game on a double play. \n",
      " Cooper finished the day with three hits and four RBI, while Wallner contributed two hits and four RBI. Lynch finished with three hits and four RBI. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",

      " BATON ROUGE, La. – With his third hit of the night, senior outfielder Antoine Duplantis tied Eddy Furniss for the LSU career hits record with 352 hits as the LSU baseball team stormed pat Stony Brook, 17-3 in the opening round of the Baton Rouge Regional Friday night in Alex Box Stadium, Skip Bertman Field. \n",
      " For the eighth consecutive year, LSU has won its regional opener, and it marks the 30th-straight regional opening victory, which is the longest streak in the history of the NCAA tournament. \n",
      " The 14-run win is the largest margin of victory in an LSU regional opener since the Tigers opened the 2000 regional opener with a 19-1 win against Jackson State and is the fifth double-digit regional opening victory since 1996 (’97, ’98, ’00, ’08, ’19). \n",
      " LSU will meet Southern Miss at 6 p.m. CT Saturday in “The Box.” TV for the game is TBD, and fans can listen to the game on the LSU Sports Radio Network, including 98.1 FM in Baton Rouge. \n",
      " “ Antoine Duplantis , I am so proud of him,” said LSU coach Paul Mainieri . “I can’t tell you how proud I am of him. To tie the all-time hits record with the great Eddy Furniss. I count myself as the lucky one who’s gotten to see every one of them. It was a great win for us.” \n",
      " Freshman Landon Marceaux improved to 5-2 on the season after throwing only 53 pitches in five innings. He limited Stony Brook to two runs—one earned—on seven hits, walked one and struck out three. \n",
      " “Landon did exactly what we had hoped he would do,” Mainieri said. “I’ve had enough experience with that Stony Brook club to know that they’re scrappy, hard-nosed, tough and they were very aggressive. I think they’re aggressiveness worked in our favor tonight because it kept Landon’s pitch count down. Sometimes they ambushed first pitches and got base hits. I think what Landon did was terrific.” \n",
      " Ma’Khail Hilliard was the first Tiger out of the bullpen and he allowed one run on one hit and struck out two in the sixth. Trent Vietmeier made his first appearance back on the mound since May 10 at Arkansas. He, Chase Costello and Rye Gunter combined for the final three innings, blanking the Seawolves after allowing two hits and striking out three. \n",
      " Right-hander Greg Marino suffered the loss and fell to 5-5 after allowing seven runs—two earned—on three hits, walked three and struck out two in 1.1 innings. \n",
      " “We only had 10 hits, but our hits really came in clutch situations,” Mainieri said. “We had a three-run double from (catcher) Saul Garza in the first inning, which kind of set the tone for the ball game. (Second baseman) Brandt Broussard had a big night with a clutch first-inning single and later a three-run homer. What I was really proud about is how our guys just didn’t let up. Every inning we went out there and had terrific at-bats and clutch hits.” \n",
      " Stony Brook was first on the board in the top of the first inning. First baseman Chris Hamilton singled through the left side and moved to second on a wild pitch before scoring on an error by the shortstop. \n",
      " The Tigers erupted for five runs on two hits and one error in the bottom of the inning to make it a 5-1 game. With the bases loaded and two outs, first baseman Chris Reid drew a walk before Garza cleared the bases with a double down the right field line. Broussard followed with a RBI single to center field to round out the five-run first inning. \n",
      " In the bottom of the second inning with shortstop Josh Smith on second base after a single and a stolen base, Duplantis slapped an RBI single up the middle. With runners in scoring position after a base hit by left fielder Daniel Cabrera , designated hitter Cade Beloso hit a sacrifice fly to left field to bring in Duplantis. Center fielder Zach Watson then hit a moon shot to left field for his sixth home run of the year, a two-run blast, to put the Tigers up 9-1. \n",
      " Duplantis drove in two runs in the bottom of the third with his single through the right side to extend the LSU lead to 11-1. \n",
      " With runners on first and second in the fourth, Broussard unloaded his first career home run to left field to put LSU up 13-1. \n",
      " In the top of the fifth inning, center fielder Michael Wilson drove in second baseman Brandon Janofsky on a fielder’s choice. \n",
      " With the bases in the fifth inning, Watson was hit by a pitch, Reid hit a sacrifice fly and Garza reached on a fielding error, which resulted in three runs for the Tigers to make it a 17-2 game. \n",
      " The Seawolves finalized the score at 17-3 when left fielder Dylan Resk homered to left field to open the sixth inning. \n",

      " Seattle Times staff reporter \n",
      " Roenis Elias whipped his head around only to watch something he didn’t want to see. The echoing sound off the bat and the sheer violence of the swing from Kole Calhoun and his cartoon-sized forearms should have been enough. \n",
      " Even the announced crowd of 28,128 knew the outcome, letting out a collective gasp and groan immediately after the ball connected with Calhoun’s maple bat. \n",
      " And yet, Elias couldn’t help it. He glared at the baseball-sized comet until it landed in the seats in right-center. His irritated gaze had no effect on its flight path or the inevitable outcome it would yield – yet another loss for the Mariners. \n",
      " Elias’ failures in the eighth inning turned a tie game into an eventual 6-3 loss to the Angels on a gorgeous late-Saturday afternoon at T-Mobile Park. \n",
      " The Mariners’ quest for back-t0-back wins will have to start again. They are now 25-36 and sinking. \n",
      " Calhoun’s 12th homer of the season broke a 3-3 tie in the eighth inning. And since he’d been relatively quiet by his standards for most of the game, Mike Trout hit a laser of a solo homer into the upper deck of left field off Chasen Bradford in the ninth inning. \n",
      " Advertising \n",
      " For Elias, it was the fifth time in six outings where he’s allowed at least one run. He looked strong while pitching a mop-up inning Thursday, but his command issues, which have been a problem throughout his career, have arisen again. Over his past six outings and a total of 5 1/3 innings pitched, Elias has allowed eight runs (six earned) on a whopping 11 hits, including two homers. \n",
      " “Ro was so good for us for a big chunk of April and May, and the last couple of weeks, he just hasn’t been the same,” manager Scott Servais said. “His changeup is his go-to pitch, but he’s struggled to get his curveball going and having other options against left-handed hitters.” \n",
      " After Cesar Puello was able to beat out his soft infield ground ball off Brandon Brennan for a single, Servais brought in Elias to finish the rest of the inning. He immediately gave up a single to Tommy LaStella that moved the go-ahead run into scoring position. It appeared as though Elias would escape the situation when he got Jonathan Lucroy to ground into a 5-4-3 double play. But with two outs and Puello on third, Elias left a 3-2 fastball up over the middle of the plate. Left-on-left matchup or not, Calhoun wasn’t going to miss that pitch. \n",
      " “He competes really well,” Servais said. “I thought he was going to get through it when he got the big double-play ball but he couldn’t get through Calhoun and it cost us.” \n",
      " Seattle’s offense, which consisted of Edwin Encarnacion, couldn’t rally again. He hit a solo homer in the fourth inning and a two-run homer in the seventh – both off Angels starter Andrew Heaney to provide Seattle’s runs. Not bad for a guy who had an emergency root canal. \n",
      " “It’s OK,” he said of the tooth. “It’s still sore, but I can still play. I’ve been feeling it the last couple of days, but the night before was the worst part. It’s still bothering me. We’ll see how I feel tomorrow.” \n",
      " Advertising \n",
      " But he was one of the few Mariners to figure out Heaney, who pitched six innings, allowing the three runs on five hits with no walks and 10 strikeouts. \n",
      " “Heaney threw the ball really well today,” Servais said. “We knew coming into the ballgame it was going to be a challenge against him. He’s deceptive. He’s got a lot of ride on the ball. He’s not the typical left-hander we’re used to seeing. Have to give him some credit. Eddie picked us up big time.” \n",
      " The Mariners got an uneven start from Tommy Milone. The veteran left-hander pitched 4 1/3 innings, allowing three runs (two earned) on seven hits with two walks and six strikeouts. He wasn’t particularly efficient and didn’t have quite the command of his previous outings. But Milone still found a way to pitch into the fifth and keeping the damage to a minimum. \n",
      " The first inning was a little shaky. Milone walked David Fletcher to start the inning and with two outs he served up a two-run homer to Albert Pujols. \n",
      " “Early on, it took a little bit to get going,” Milone said. “It was a bit of a battle. After that first inning, I was able to settle down a little bit to make some better pitches.” \n",
      " Pujols came into the game hitting .440 with (11 for 25) against Milone. \n",
      " “Going down 1-0 on him and throwing a fastball up in the middle of the plate probably isn’t a good idea, especially to him,” Milone said. “Career-wise, he’s had me pretty good. So it’s not a surprise.” \n",

      " Jordan Spieth remained a stroke off the lead with a 70, with Troy Merritt (66), South Korea's Lee Kyoung-hoon (67) and German Martin Kaymer (68) tied at the top on eight-under 135. Woods overcame a shaky start to make three birdies before putting up a seven at the par five 15th en route to an even par 72. \n",

      " \"All of us were watching Rosie get things going on the front nine.\" \n",
      " After opening with a 75, Rose, who played with Woods, turned his day around by going 10-under in a 12-hole stretch that included two eagles and six birdies. He finished the day three shots off the lead on six-under 138. \n",

      " Yankees No. 3 prospect strikes out six, gives up two hits \n",
      " Friday's start marked the second time this season Albert Abreu has walked two batters or fewer. (Michael Dill/Trenton Thunder) \n",
      " By Chris Bumbaca / MiLB.com | May 31, 2019 10:35 PM \n",
      " Feel good, pitch good. It sounds simple, but it's the truth for Albert Abreu. \n",
      " In his longest outing of the season, the Yankees' third-ranked prospect fired seven scoreless innings. He allowed two hits and two walks, striking out six, as Double-A Trenton blanked Harrisburg, 2-0, on Friday at Arm & Hammer Park. \n",
      " \"He's been getting after it,\" Thunder pitching coach Tim Norton said. \"He's been ready for the first pitch of every inning, not easing into it, just kind of getting after it right from the get-go. He settled in and got in a good rhythm.\" \n",
      " Video: Trenton's Abreu whiffs sixth \n",
      " Nationals No. 2 prospect Luis Garcia led off the game with a single to center field. From there, it was all Abreu (2-4). \n",
      " The native of the Dominican Republic didn't allow another hit until his final inning. After issuing a leadoff walk to Austin Davidson in the fourth, Abreu retired nine in a row. Nats No. 20 prospect Tres Barrera opened the seventh with a double off the wall in center, but the 23-year-old recorded three straight outs to strand Barrera at third and protect a 1-0 lead. \n",
      " Gameday box score \n",
      " Finding a way to pitch out of trouble in key spots is a vital step in his development. \n",
      " \"You're starting to see it coming out of him in big spots, making big pitches and limiting damage, which is huge,\" Norton said. \"Once in a while, you're going to have those big innings. He's getting closer and closer to consistently leave guys out there in big spots. He came off the mound fired up, and he should have been, tight game like that. It was huge.\" \n",
      " Abreu threw 55 of 84 pitches for strikes in his first scoreless start of the season. The two free passes were the fewest he's allowed since walking a pair against New Hampshire on April 24. In his previous two starts, the 6-foot-2 righty issued 10 free passes over 10 2/3 innings, including a six-walk outing on May 24 at Binghamton, where he surrendered a season-high six runs in five frames. \n",
      " \"He's put together a really good stretch the last six or seven games,\" Norton said. \"The last one was a dud, of course, with the walks and everything. But he's been in a great spot.\" \n",
      " Abreu has begun rounding into form this month. Prior to the Binghamton outing, he yielded five runs -- four earned -- over 24 2/3 innings in his previous four outings. \n",
      " Throwing the ball over the plate is always an emphasis, and Norton described Friday's performance \"a comeback start\" in that regard. \n",
      " \"Everything he has is good,\" the pitching coach said. \"He has a terrific arm, two plus off-speed pitches. They just need to show up more consistently, and they're starting to. He's not far away. It's just about being consistent. I know that's the everyday answer, but he has what it takes so that when he needs to make a pitch, he makes a pitch.\" \n",
      " Abreu lowered his ERA to 4.11 and has 43 strikeouts over 50 1/3 innings. On Friday, his 65-grade fastball reached 100 mph as late as the fourth inning and his curveball was particularly sharp. The uptick in velocity is something Norton has seen more of this season. His fastball sat typically in the mid-90s last year. \n",
      " \"He came to us with that [velocity],\" the pitching coach said. \"Like a lot of guys, it fluctuates over two to three years. \n",
      " \"I think his arm just feels better this year, and you're starting to see him sit at 97, 98 in some starts.\" \n",
      " Abreu's health also has improved. He had three separate stints on the injured list in 2018, when all but one of his non-rehab starts were with Class A Advanced Tampa. Certain pitchers, Norton said, pitch differently when their arm feels better. \n",
      " \"It might be for a few months, it might be for a year,\" he said. \"I think that's just kind of the life of a pitcher, where it just doesn't feel 100 percent for a pitcher. He's coming out of the gates every game getting after it, and it's coming out hot. I'm sure it feels a little better, overall.\" \n",

      " Sanchez hit his 18th home run, a tiebreaking two-run shot in the fifth inning Saturday night, to match his total from last season as the Yankees beat the Red Sox, 5-3, in front of a sellout crowd of 46,307 at the Stadium. \n",
      " The AL East-leading Yankees (38-19), now 32-10 since their 6-9 start, moved 2 ½ games ahead of the Rays and 9 ½ games clear of the third-place Red Sox (29-29), who have yet to beat the Yankees this season (0-4). By winning these first two games, the Yankees guaranteed themselves a ninth straight series victory and haven't dropped one since falling twice to Arizona on April 30 and May 1. \n",
      " With the score tied at 3-3 after Boston tied it with two runs in the fourth, Sanchez stepped in against Rick Porcello with Luke Voit aboard and two outs in the fifth. Sanchez slammed a 2-and-2 slider the other way to make it 5-3. \n",
      " Sanchez has 18 homers in 148 at-bats in 39 games after hitting 18 homers in 89 games last season, a year in which he was sidelined two separate times because of a right groin strain and a bum left shoulder that would require offseason surgery. Sanchez, an All-Star in 2017, produced a .186/.291/.406 slash line in 2018 and, for a second straight year, led the majors in passed balls with 18. \n",
      " Suffice to say, little has been said about his defense this season. In fact, he hasn't faced much criticism at all.  \n",

      " After Sanchez’s homer, a bullpen that has been most impenetrable of late did it again as Chad Green, Tommy Kahnle, Adam Ottavino, Jonathan Holder, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman brought the victory home, allowing no runs, five hits and two walks in 5 1/3 innings. \n",
      " Ottavino recorded perhaps the biggest out, striking out J.D. Martinez with an unhittable slider with two on and two outs to end the sixth. Chapman walked Mookie Betts and allowed a single by Andrew Benintendi to start the ninth, but Martinez hit into a 6-4-3 double play and Rafael Devers grounded out to end it. \n",
      " Domingo German came in an impressive 9-1 with a 3.43 ERA but in a mini-slump of sorts. The righthander allowed a season-worst seven runs and nine hits last Sunday in Kansas City, allowing four homers in the no-decision. He had allowed five homers in his first 10 games. \n",
      " On Saturday night, German allowed three runs and six hits in 3 2/3 innings, striking out eight. Green replaced him and threw 1 2/3 scoreless innings, with his biggest sequence coming in the fifth. With runners at second and third and one out, he struck out Brock Holt and Michael Chavis. \n",
      " Porcello came in an unimpressive 4-4 with a 4.41 ERA and was predictably unimpressive. The righthander, after a scoreless first, allowed five runs and nine hits in 4 2/3 innings. \n",
      " Gleyber Torres, hitting .319 with a 1.130 OPS in his previous 19 games, launched a 2-and-2 fastball off the wall in right-center for a long single to start the second inning. Kendrys Morales (three hits) then roped a single down the rightfield line to put runners at the corners. One out later, but Gio Urshela singled to right to tie it at 1. \n",
      " Brett Gardner singled to right to load the bases and DJ LeMahieu did what he’s done most of the season with runners in scoring position, banging one back up the middle for a two-run single that made it 3-1. That improved him to 22-for-47 with RISP. \n",
      " In the fourth, Xander Bogaerts homered and Sandy Leon singled home a run to tie it at 3-3. \n",

      " \"I pitched seven innings against one of the best lineups in baseball, and I didn't see a single barreled ball to the outfield all game in seven innings,\" he said. \"All weak contact, all ground balls.

      " Arenado followed singles by Story and Dahl with one of his own to drive in the first run, and Murphy made it 3-0 with a two-run double past center fielder Jonathan Davis. \n",
      " \"Getting that three-run lead early tonight was really nice,\" Gray said. \"I was able to sit back and pitch my game and not have to worry about, 'Hey, if I give up a solo here we're in trouble.' It was nice to be able to pitch like that.\" \n",

      " SAN DIEGO — Three solo home runs were enough to power the San Diego Padres past the Miami Marlins. \n",
      " Franmil Reyes, Hunter Renfroe and Ian Kinsler homered, and left-hander Joey Lucchesi combined with two relievers on a four-hitter for his first victory in six starts to lead the San Diego Padres to a 5-2 victory Friday night. \n",
      " \"We thrive with the long ball and we've got the guys who can hit them,\" manager Andy Green said. \"You have to embrace who you are. We've got a lot of slug as a club. It's nice when you get guys on base and hit two- and three-run homers, but solos did it today.\" \n",
      " Lucchesi certainly enjoyed the power display. \n",
      " \"I love it. I love when guys hit them,\" the big lefty said. \"It makes them feel good, it makes us feel good. It's great.\" \n",
      " Lucchesi (4-3) hadn't won since beating Cincinnati at home on April 21. He retired his first seven batters before allowing a double by Miguel Rojas in the third. He then retired eight straight before allowing a home run by pinch-hitter Rosell Herrera with one out in the sixth. Lucchesi struck out five and walked one. \n",
      " Craig Stammen pitched 1 2/3 hitless innings, Phil Maton allowed two singles to open the Marlins' ninth and Kirby Yates came on to get the final three outs for his 22nd save, best in the majors. \n",
      " Herrera was pinch-hitting for lefty Caleb Smith (3-3), who lost his third straight decision after allowing two runs and three hits in five innings. He struck out eight and walked two. \n",
      " \"I thought he threw the ball really well,\" manager Don Mattingly said. \"Gives up the two solos, but I think we saw the finish that we talked about before, more swing and miss. Definitely a lot better out of Caleb tonight.\" \n",
      " The Padres \"don't really chase too far out of the zone,\" Mattingly said. \"They've got swing and miss but they don't chase all over the place, so there were a lot of deep counts and you've got to make pitches, so we know they're dangerous from that standpoint.\" \n",
      " Reyes homered on a line shot to left with one out in the first, his 16th. Renfroe hit a moonshot into the second balcony on the Western Metal Supply Co. Building in the left-field corner with one out in the fourth for his 15th. \n",
      " \"I felt like my stuff was pretty good,\" Smith said. \"Just made a couple mistakes and I've got to stop giving up the long ball.\" \n",

      " NEW YORK -- DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1Â½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay - and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",

Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",

He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",

He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",
      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. \n",

      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",

He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",

      " Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter, and put four players on the right side of the infield. But Carpenter drove in Wong with a fly ball that found the grass in the left field corner. \n",
      " Carlos MartÃ­nez pitched a perfect eighth for St. Louis, and Jordan Hicks (2-2) worked two scoreless innings. The last pitch Hicks threw in the ninth registered at 104.3 mph, which is the fastest in baseball this season.  \n",

      " ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Joey Gallo stood in center field trying not to beat himself up after misplaying two fly balls into triples as he and the Texas Rangers trailed the Kansas City Royals by two runs going into the sixth inning. \n",
      " Soon enough, Gallo took out his frustrations on the baseball. \n",
      " Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth inning outburst as the Rangers rallied past the Royals 6-2 Friday night. \n",
      " The Rangers have won five of their last six home games while the Royals have lost of four of their last five overall. \n",
      " Gallo's home run, his team-leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet and landed in the second seating area beyond the center-field wall. \n",
      " \"Things turned around quick,\" Gallo said. In his first season playing regularly in center, he also redeemed himself defensively by finishing the game with a diving catch in left-center on a ball hit by Billy Hamilton. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. Jurado allowed two runs on five hits and three walks. The second-year right-hander, who was recalled from Triple-A Nashville on April 26, had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " All of that on a night when his parents, Ariel Sr. and Yizel, had traveled from Panama to see him pitch in the majors for the first time. \n",
      " \"That was something special,\" Jurado said through an interpreter. \n",
      " With Jurado outpitched by veteran Royals left-hander Danny Duffy through five innings, Rangers manager Chris Woodward thought his youngster deserved a better fate given the circumstances. \n",
      " \"I'm saying a little prayer 'cause the baseball gods should be with us on this one,\" Woodward said. \"Like, I was hoping for three (runs).\" \n",
      " Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26, his first start of the season after recovering from last year's shoulder injury. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, he allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks — both in the sixth. \n",
      " \"This game will rip your heart out sometimes,\" Duffy said. \"But I've got to turn the page after tonight and go back out there, try to be better next time.\" \n",
      " Texas loaded the bases in the sixth inning on outfield singles by Shin-Soo Choo and Elvis Andrus and a chopper hit between third base and the mound by Hunter Pence. Duffy fielded Pence's grounder, but his throw to first base was late. \n",
      " Duffy walked Nomar Mazara with the bases loaded to tie the score 2-2. Gallo then launched a 1-1 fastball to end a six-game homerless streak, which matched his longest this season. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Cuthbert, who earlier Friday had his contract selected from Triple-A Omaha, hit an opposite-field homer that just cleared the right-field wall in the second and also made a standout play at third base. \n",
      " \"He's always been a really good defender at third base for us,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said of Cuthbert. \"That's kind of expected.\" \n",
      " Gordon's triple in the fifth inning turned around Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway center, scoring Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. \n",
      " All of that was forgotten in the bottom of the sixth. \n",
      " SHORT HOPS \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. ... The Royals lead the majors with 24 triples. ... Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base to give the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",
      " PRE-GAME MOVES \n",
      " To make room for Cuthbert, the Royals designated INF-OF Chris Owings for assignment. The Rangers selected the contract of RHP David Carpenter from Nashville and optioned OF Zack Granite to Nashville. \n",

      " 9:18 pm \n",
      " Brewers , Sport , Top Sports Stories , Wisconsin sports from the Associated Press \n",
      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pittsburgh Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin in a 9-4 victory Friday night. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing “Bellieve” T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell’s two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise’s 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Archer struck out seven and walked two while needed only 92 pitches to get 21 outs as the injury-ravaged Pirates won for only the third time in their last 11 games. \n",
      " Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command briefly abandoned him in the third inning. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh’s lead to 5-1. Peralta replaced Chacin and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh’s advantage to 7-1. \n",
      " Chacin — a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series — saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " Aguilar hit his first home run in a month when he took Archer to the bushes beyond the center-field wall in leading off the third. Hiura pushed Milwaukee’s home run total to 98 — tops in the National League — with a three-run shot to center in fourth. \n",
      " Hiura had three of Milwaukee’s six hits, but the second baseman was also charged with two of the Brewers’ three errors on a funky play in the seventh when a liner by Jacob Stallings deflected off Peralta’s glove to Hiura, who couldn’t corral it initially, then threw into the Milwaukee dugout when he rushed his throw in an effort to get Stallings. \n",
      " TRAINER’S ROOM \n",
      " Brewers: C Manny Pina (right hamstring discomfort) is expected to rejoin Milwaukee over the weekend. Pina is hitting .300 (3 for 10) during a rehab stint with Class A Wisconsin entering Friday. \n",
      " Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles (left hamstring discomfort) will start Sunday’s series finale. Lyles exited a loss to Cincinnati last Tuesday after tweaking the hamstring in the fourth inning. … RHP Keone Kela will be shut down for 10 days after the right shoulder discomfort that sent him to the injured list popped back up during a rehab assignment. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Brewers: Brandon Woodruff (7-1, 3.22 ERA) will look for his seventh straight win on Saturday. Woodruff entered the season with five career victories spread across 2017 and 2018. He limited the Phillies to one run in eight innings last Sunday. \n",
      " Pirates: Nick Kingham (1-1, 8.28) hasn’t won a game as a starter since last July, but will get the nod on Saturday. Kingham — who has bounced between the bullpen and the rotation this season — allowed three runs in 4 2/3 innings against Cincinnati on Monday. \n",

      " FOXBORO — The potential tying run for the Foxboro High baseball team was standing at second base in both the fourth and fifth innings, while run No. 4 was waiting to cross the plate from third base in the sixth inning. \n",
      " After scoring three times in the third inning runs to set the script in motion for an MIAA Tournament berth, the Warriors went scoreless through the final four frames, held in check by Norton High starting pitcher Mike Belcher and sophomore reliever Zach Adams. \n",
      " “They made one more play, in the end the team that makes the most plays is going to come out on top,” Foxboro High coach Derek Suess said after the MIAA Tournanent-bound Lancers left Booth Playground Friday with a 4-3 victory. \n",
      " The Lancers, who had edged Foxboro 3-2 in nine innings earlier this season, sent 10 batters to the plate in a four-run fourth inning, using three hits, two walks and a pair of Foxboro errors to erase a three-run deficit. \n",
      " “We probably played well enough to win,” Suess said of the Warriors’ six hits and having runners on base in all but the second and seventh innings. \n",
      " In the fourth inning, Sean Yoest singled into left field and Adam Lanctot drew a two-out walk before Belcher got the Lancers (13-6) out of the jam with a strikeout to end the frame. \n",
      " In the fifth inning, Mike Devlin singled to the shortstop hole and Joe Cavalieri drew a walk. But with only one out, the Warriors were unable to advance as Belcher induced a popup to shortstop Joe Fasalino, then notched his 10th strikeout to end the Foxboro bid. \n",
      " Tom Marcucella drew a one out walk in the sixth inning for Foxboro (6-14), stole second base and moved to third on a ground ball, but Adams got a popup to Colin Faherty at third base to end that Warrior chance. \n",
      " In the seventh inning, Adams, a righthander with few innings of varsity experience this season, retired the Foxboro side in order, with first baseman Jack O’Brien making a diving stab of a hard-hit grounder off the bat of Devlin to take away a hit and then lunging to the bag for the second out. \n",
      " Belcher had tormented Foxboro over two innings, with the junior righthander fanning six of the first seven Warriors that he faced. \n",
      " But Foxboro began to put its bats on his 80-mph-plus fastballs. Lanctot stroked a two-strike single into left and put the Warriors in front when Anthony Mollica smashed a triple to left. Brian Duncan drew a walk, and a Devlin grounder scored the second Foxboro run before Cavalieri followed with a two-out RBI double into left field. \n",
      " “They (Norton) took advantage of when it matter and that was the difference,” Suess said. \n",
      " Norton had just five hits off of Cavalieri, Foxboro’s starting pitcher, through six innings. The righthander also issued just one walk. \n",
      " Norton had Faherty reach base on a leadoff Foxboro error to pave the way for its four-run outburst. Both K.J. Williams and OBrien followed with singles. A Cam Stolpner fielder’s choice plated Norton’s first run. A booted grounder off the bat of Jack Patalano produced the Lancers’ second run. Both Brody Tinkham and Derek Donahue then drew bases-loaded walks to force in the tying and winning runs. \n",
      " Belcher threw 108 pitches over five innings of work, but in stranding a half-dozen Warriors on the bases — including Devlin (via a single) at second base in the first inning — Foxboro was unable to deliver a timely hit. \n",
      " Foxboro reliever Cam Prescott retired the Lancers in order in the sixth inning with one strikeout, as did Yoest, with one strikeout in the seventh inning. \n",
      " “I was proud of the way that we played, we knew that Norton would be a tough team,” Suess said. “We knew that it wasn’t going to be easy. Norton is a good team, they’re going to make you work hard. It was a challenge for us.” \n",
      " The Lancers have one more regular season game remaining, at home Sunday afternoon at 3 against Hopkinton. \n",

      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Tanner Roark's first career homer wasn't enough to get the win against his former Nationals teammates. Instead, it went to the other half of the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " \"A weird day,\" Nationals starter Eric Fedde said. \n",
      " Except for the outcome. Nothing surprising about the Nationals winning in Cincinnati. \n",
      " Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Nationals to a 5-2 victory — their ninth in 10 games at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason for Tanner Rainey. Both pitchers came away with a career moment. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Fedde, his first in 336 career plate appearances. \n",
      " \"I felt like my emotions were under control,\" said Roark, who went six innings. \"It's definitely a tough loss. The bunt and the home run felt good. I would've rather have won the game.\" \n",
      " Two homers made the difference. \n",
      " Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 36 2/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Rainey (1-1), who got into the game in the fifth. He acknowledged that he had extra motivation facing his former team, and he fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. \n",
      " \"For me getting the first win in here, it is special,\" Rainey said. \n",
      " Rainey fanned Yasiel Puig with a runner on third to end the fifth inning, and then struck out two more batters in the sixth. \n",
      " \"He's going to be a good one, he really is,\" manager Dave Martinez said. \"He has that look when he comes out of the bullpen that I really like.” \n",
      " Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Washington's Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. It was the longest hitting streak by a player under age 21 since Manny Machado also hit in 14 straight games in 2013. \n",
      " DOMINATION \n",
      " The Nationals are 17-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " DOUBLE TROUBLE \n",
      " The Reds hit into double plays in the first, third and fifth innings, helping Fedde escape trouble. \n",
      " \"That's the best I could have hoped for,\" said Fedde, who gave up six hits and three walks in four-plus innings. \"That's when the ground ball really comes into play. That saved me today.\" \n",
      " STREAKS \n",
      " Washington's Anthony Rendon has reached base in 18 consecutive games, going 22 for 64 with six doubles, two triples, four homers and 16 walks. Cincinnati's Nick Senzel doubled, extending his streak to nine games, the longest by a Red this season. \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers' home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids - Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",

      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",

      " ATLANTA, Ga. (WCTV) -- Florida A&M fell behind early to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and couldn't keep the momentum in their favor in the middle innings as they dropped their first game in regional play, 13-2, on Friday night at Russ Chandler Stadium. \n",
      " Georgia Tech scored runs in each of the first three innings of the game against FAMU starter Kyle Coleman, who was unable to settle himself down in the early going (though three Rattler errors in each of those innings didn't help things). \n",
      " Tech's first runs came in the bottom of the first, when leadoff walks were issued to Luke Waddell and Michael Guldberg to set the table for Kyle McCann, who singled into right field but, but the ball was misplayed by right fielder Jared Weber, allowing two runs to score to give the Yellow Jackets a 2-0 lead. \n",
      " McCann slipped while rounding second and was tagged out. \n",
      " GT added to their lead in the second on an equally weird play. \n",
      " Waddell singled into left field with two on, both of which reached via lead off walks, but Seyjuan Lawrence made a good play to get to the ball and hold the lead runner at third, which would have loaded the bases, if not for  the Rattlers agreeing to Jackson Webb's game of pickle, which led to an errant throw home and his scoring, making it 3-0. \n",
      " Two batters later, Tristin English hit a long, loud sacrifice fly to score another run, making it 4-0. \n",
      " Another sacrifice fly, off the bat of Nick Wilhite, gave Tech a 5-0 lead in the third. \n",
      " From there, Coleman settled down tremendously, never facing more than four batters in the same inning for the rest of his outing. He was taken out after 5.2 innings of work, allowing five runs on nine hits, seven walks and four strikeouts. \n",
      " The Rattlers, despite being quiet on the scoreboard in the early frames, made good early contact against GT starter Amos Willingham but weren't able to break through in the early going, sending four batters the the plate in the first but the minimum in the second, third and fourth. \n",
      " FAMU's offensive fortunes changed in the fifth, sending eight batters to the plate and scoring twice. \n",
      " Willis McDaniel led the inning off by getting hit by a pitch, Lawrence singled  and Kaycee Reese drew a walk to load the bases for Brett Maxwell, who hit a sacrifice fly to center field to score McDaniel and pull the Rattlers within 5-1. \n",
      " The next at-bat, Ryan Coscarella laid down a perfect bunt up the first base line as part of a suicide squeeze that scored Lawrence and put Coscarella safe at first base, making for a 5-2. \n",
      " FAMU proceeded to load the bases again - Robert Robinson reached on a fielder's choice and Octavien Moyer was hit by a pitch - to set the table for Tucker Rayburn, who struck out swinging to end the threat. \n",
      " After that inning, the Rattlers wouldn't put runs on the board, despite leaving runners on base in the next three frames, including a wasting a pair of lead off doubles in the sixth and seventh. \n",
      " Georgia Tech added five runs in the bottom of the seventh inning and three in the bottom of the eighth to take their eventual winning 13-2 lead. \n",

      " Kole Calhoun beats the odds, homers against a left-hander to lift Angels \n",
      " Jun 01, 2019 | 9:20 PM \n",
      " | SEATTLE \n",
      " Angels' Kole Calhoun is congratulated by third base coach Mike Gallego after hitting a go-ahead two-run home off Seattle Mariners' Roenis Elias during the eighth inning on Saturday in Seattle. (John Froschauer / Associated Press) \n",
      " This was not the kind of matchup that has generally favored the Angels this season. \n",
      " First, they faced a left-hander on the mound. The Angels entered Saturday with a .228 average, ranked 26th in the major leagues, and a .703 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, ranked 22nd, against left-handers. \n",
      " Advertisement \n",
      " Then, at the plate stood Kole Calhoun, a left-handed batter who was hitting .180 against left-handers this season and was two for 11 with two strikeouts and two walks lifetime against Seattle Mariners reliever Roenis Elias. \n",
      " With one vicious swing at a full-count pitch, Calhoun stuffed those odds in a shredder. The Angels right fielder drove an up-and-away 94-mph fastball over the wall in right-center field for a tie-breaking two-run home run in the eighth inning of a 6-3 victory before 28,128 in T-Mobile Park. \n",
      " By Mike DiGiovanna \n",
      " Jun 01, 2019 | 7:25 PM \n",
      " “I’ve had some at-bats off him, and I guess that helps,” Calhoun said after the Angels won for the sixth time in eight games. “I’ve seen him before, and I know what he’s got. I battled back and forth, laid off some good pitches. I got a good pitch to hit and put a good swing on it.” \n",
      " The score was tied 3-3 when Cesar Puello led off the eighth with an infield single and Tommy La Stella singled to right. Up stepped catcher Jonathan Lucroy, who was hitless in three at-bats but has dropped all of seven sacrifice bunts in 10 big-league seasons. \n",
      " “It crossed my mind,” Angels manager Brad Ausmus said of bunting Lucroy, “but he hasn’t bunted much in his life. That’s usually a recipe for disaster.” \n",
      " Lucroy grounded into a double play before Calhoun, who hit .299 with a .946 OPS in May after hitting .194 with a .716 OPS in March and April, came through. \n",
      " Mike Trout added a solo homer in the ninth for a 6-3 lead, his team-leading 14th of the season and 22nd in T-Mobile Park, the most by a visiting player in stadium history. Cam Bedrosian, Ty Buttrey and Hansel Robles each threw an inning of scoreless relief behind Andrew Heaney, who delivered a second strong start after missing the first two months of the season because of elbow inflammation. \n",
      " Sign up for our daily sports newsletter » \n",
      " Heaney allowed three runs and five hits in six innings, striking out 10—eight with his curveball—and walking none. The left-hander got swinging strikes on 22 of the 92 pitches he threw, 15 on his 36 breaking balls and seven on his 53 sinking fastballs. \n",
      " But Heaney made at least two glaring mistakes that were crushed by Edwin Encarnacion, who drove a 1-and-0 changeup 400 feet over the left-field wall for a solo homer in the fourth and a full-count curve 438 feet to center for a two-run shot in the sixth that tied the score 3-3. \n",
      " The Angels scored twice in the first when David Fletcher walked and Albert Pujols hit a towering two-run homer to left, his 10th this season. \n",
      " “Going down 1-and-0 and throwing a fastball to him is probably not a good idea,” Seattle starter Tommy Milone said. \n",
      " The Angels pushed the lead to 3-0 in the third when Fletcher doubled to left, Pujols was intentionally walked with two out and Puello hit an RBI double to left. \n",
      " “Getting a win—that’s all that matters,” said Heaney, who used the words “kind of mediocre” to describe his first two starts, in which he’s allowed five runs and 10 hits—four of them homers—struck out 18 and walked one in 11 innings. \n",
      " “They spotted me some early runs and I kind of let them creep back into it. Not what I was trying to do, obviously. But that swing that Kole put on it … that was awesome. That was the fatal blow, so that was good.” \n",

      " The victory placed LSU in a winner's bracket game Saturday night against Southern Mississippi (39-19), which defeated Arizona State 15-3 earlier Friday in the Baton Rouge regional. The Sun Devils (37-18) and Seawolves (31-22) were slated to play an elimination game Saturday afternoon. \n",

      " PITTSBURGH — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times, and the Pittsburgh Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin in a 9-4 victory Friday night. \n",
      " Bell went 2-for-5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing “Bellieve” T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell’s two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise’s 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Archer struck out seven and walked two while needed only 92 pitches to get 21 outs as the injury-ravaged Pirates won for only the third time in their last 11 games. \n",

      " The Reds made quick work of one of the majors’ best pitchers. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. \n",
      " Corbin was coming off one of his best performances, a four-hitter for his second career shutout against the Marlins on Saturday. His feared slider wasn’t much from the outset as the Reds piled up six singles and Casali’s homer in the first inning, scoring five times. \n",
      " Casali’s homer was his first this season off a regular pitcher. He also connected off Cubs catcher Victor Caratini during a 10-2 win at Wrigley Field on May 26. Casali added a single and an RBI double as the Reds piled up 15 hits. \n",

      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. \n",
      " Rafael Devers homered early for the third-place Red Sox, who fell 8½ games back in the division. That’s the furthest they’ve been behind the Yankees since finishing the 2015 season nine games in the dust. \n",
      " New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",
      " Sale found his fastball after an April 16 loss at Yankee Stadium left him 0-4 in four starts. He allowed only 12 earned runs in his next seven outings and entered this one with a whopping 56 strikeouts in May. \n",
      " But after the teams were rained out the previous night, Sale was touched up for four runs and seven hits in six innings Friday, pounding his fist into his glove in frustration after LeMahieu’s opposite-field homer cleared the right-center fence in the fifth. The left-hander struck out 10 for a sixth double-digit strikeout game in his past eight starts. \n",
      " n Twins 5, Rays 3 \n",
      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking two-run single off Diego Castillo in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and Minnesota beat Tampa Bay. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",
      " Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " Left-hander Adam Kolarek relieved, and the left-handed hitting Rosario grounded an opposite-field single to left, past the spot vacated when third baseman Christian Arroyo shifted toward shortstop. \n",

      " The Beavers' 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton, which followed a 7-6 loss to American Athletic Conference champ Cincinnati on Friday, knocked them out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",

      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman's last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",

      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",

      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",

      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",

      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",

      " I am embarrassed to admit that I do not recognize either of these models. Because of this I am forced to hereby dub them White Bikini and Black Bikini, for the sake of clarity. I do not know the relationship of these women. It could be an innocent day at the beach between two friends having some fun. It could be two young lovers living out a romantic fantasy. It could be, but I doubt. Judging by the status of their bikini bottoms in their rumps, they are actually competing in an altered version of the game Hungry Hungry Hippos. By my estimation, it seems that White Bikini is is in the lead. I would not count Black Bikini out entirely just yet, she seems to have a lot of fight left in her. \n",
      " I do not know what looks these two were going for, but I am getting a distinct vibe of Ursula Andress in Dr. No from White Bikini. That is a compliment that I have never given out before in my life, and will probably never give out again. I guess that would make Black Bikini Sean Connery. Again, I do not hand that compliment out lightly, even if it is to a woman. \n",

      " For the eighth consecutive year, LSU has won its regional opener. The 14-run win is the largest margin of victory in a regional opener since the Tigers opened the 2000 regional opener with a 19-1 win against Jackson State and is the fifth double-digit regional opening victory since 1996 (’97, ’98, ’00, ’08, ’19). \n",

      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The Minnesota Twins are a hit — and getting hit. \n",
      " Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and the  Twins beat the Tampa Bay Rays 5-3 Friday night in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game lead in the AL Central. \n",
      " \"We don't want our guys getting nicked up or anything, but sometimes you take the baserunners any way you can,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"And sometimes it takes a base hit with men on base to kind of wake everyone up and get things going.\" \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",
      " \"It's something we've seen this year. In the games that we have not played our best or lost, we've come back the day after and really pulled together and played good baseball,\" Baldelli said. \"It's what we've come to expect. I think we have the type of guys that regardless of what happens today, they'll be ready to play tomorrow.\" \n",
      " Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " The Twins have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. They trailed 3-1 in the fifth before Polanco drove in a run with his second double and scored on a single by Willians Astudillo. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout. Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo plunked Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " Kolarek, a left-hander, relieved to face the left-handed hitting Rosario, and Rosario grounded an opposite-field single to left, past the spot vacated when third baseman Christian Arroyo shifted toward shortstop. \n",
      " Rogers (2-1) retired his first six batters, allowed Daniel Robertson's two-out single in the ninth, then retired Mike Zunino on a groundout. \n",
      " Berríos struck out eight in 6 2/3 innings, allowing three runs and three hits. \n",
      " Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. \n",
      " Astudillo had an RBI single in the first, but Kevin Kiermaier's two-run homer in the second put the Rays ahead. Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",
      " Astudillo was thrown out at the plate by Kiermaier while trying to score on C.J. Cron's two-out double to center. \n",
      " SCARY \n",
      " Rays pitcher Emilio Pagán was hit on the right cheek by a line drive off Schoop's bat in the sixth but remained in the game. \n",
      " \"I was lucky,\" Pagan said. \"Probably my No. 1 fear, most pitchers will agree, that a ball coming back at you is not a fun situation to be in. It could have gotten me on my hand a lot more serious, and it definitely could have hit me in the face a lot harder.\" \n",

      " By The Associated Press \n",
      " May 31, 2019 \n",
      " ARLINGTON, Texas — Joey Gallo stood in center field trying not to beat himself up after misplaying two fly balls into triples as he and the Texas Rangers trailed the Kansas City Royals by two runs going into the sixth inning. \n",
      " Soon enough, Gallo took out his frustrations on the baseball. \n",
      " Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth inning outburst as the Rangers rallied past the Royals 6-2 Friday night. \n",
      " The Rangers have won five of their last six home games while the Royals have lost of four of their last five overall. \n",
      " Gallo's home run, his team-leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet and landed in the second seating area beyond the center-field wall. \n",
      " \"Things turned around quick,\" Gallo said. In his first season playing regularly in center, he also redeemed himself defensively by finishing the game with a diving catch in left-center on a ball hit by Billy Hamilton. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. Jurado allowed two runs on five hits and three walks. The second-year right-hander, who was recalled from Triple-A Nashville on April 26, had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " All of that on a night when his parents, Ariel Sr. and Yizel, had traveled from Panama to see him pitch in the majors for the first time. \n",
      " \"That was something special,\" Jurado said through an interpreter. \n",
      " With Jurado outpitched by veteran Royals left-hander Danny Duffy through five innings, Rangers manager Chris Woodward thought his youngster deserved a better fate given the circumstances. \n",
      " \"I'm saying a little prayer 'cause the baseball gods should be with us on this one,\" Woodward said. \"Like, I was hoping for three (runs).\" \n",
      " Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26, his first start of the season after recovering from last year's shoulder injury. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, he allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks — both in the sixth. \n",
      " \"This game will rip your heart out sometimes,\" Duffy said. \"But I've got to turn the page after tonight and go back out there, try to be better next time.\" \n",
      " Texas loaded the bases in the sixth inning on outfield singles by Shin-Soo Choo and Elvis Andrus and a chopper hit between third base and the mound by Hunter Pence. Duffy fielded Pence's grounder, but his throw to first base was late. \n",
      " Duffy walked Nomar Mazara with the bases loaded to tie the score 2-2. Gallo then launched a 1-1 fastball to end a six-game homerless streak, which matched his longest this season. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Cuthbert, who earlier Friday had his contract selected from Triple-A Omaha, hit an opposite-field homer that just cleared the right-field wall in the second and also made a standout play at third base. \n",
      " \"He's always been a really good defender at third base for us,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said of Cuthbert. \"That's kind of expected.\" \n",
      " Gordon's triple in the fifth inning turned around Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway center, scoring Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. \n",
      " All of that was forgotten in the bottom of the sixth. \n",
      " SHORT HOPS \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. ... The Royals lead the majors with 24 triples. ... Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base to give the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",
      " PRE-GAME MOVES \n",

      " Jun 1, 2019 at 5:47 PM Jun 1, 2019 at 5:47 PM \n",
      " Buddy Thomas \n",
      " Chris Cabe knew what he was getting into when he took over a struggling Wareham baseball program prior to the 2017 season. \n",
      " But after going 3-17 in his first year as head coach, no one would have blamed the former Vikings’ star athlete for having second thoughts. Cabe’s only thoughts, however, were focused on a future that preferably featured a string of happy endings to his school’s spring baseball seasons. \n",
      " “My goal has always been to get our team prepared well enough to qualify for the tournament and going 3-17 that first season was a bitter disappointment to all of us,” Cabe said. That disappointment transformed itself into frustration the following season when last year’s team just missed qualifying for postseason play with a 9-11 record. \n",
      " “We began last season 1-7 but fought back and put ourselves in position to qualify by having to win one of our last two games,” Cabe recalled. “We lost a game at Carver on a walk-off in the bottom of the seventh inning and beat ourselves when our pitchers walked 10 and our defense made six errors in a loss to Old Rochester in the final regular season game. That was frustrating. But it was also indicative of how we played through much of that season.” \n",
      " Despite the disappointment and frustration that tainted his first two years at the helm, Cabe’s optimism endured and he prepped this year’s team with the usual fight song. \n",
      " “We want to qualify for the tournament and go from there,” he said, knowing that the bulk of this year’s roster had heard that same refrain for the last three seasons. \n",
      " On paper, this year’s Wareham team was loaded with veteran talent. But it was the same talent that had been unable to get it done on the playing field the past two seasons and, after a 2-6 start, clouds of frustration and disappointment were beginning to roll in. \n",
      " “I had a conversation with the team and told them they were playing two teams, the opponent and themselves and they were losing to both,” Cabe said. “I told them to forget what’s happened in the past and focus on the present by taking things one game at a time and it was like a mental switch had been turned on.” \n",
      " The Vikings went on to win eight of their next 10 games and with Wednesday’s 8-0 victory over Somerset Berkley, Wareham improved to 10-8 to qualify for the postseason tournament for the first time in seven years. \n",

      " APPONEQUET: Lefthanded ace Colin Fahey temporarily took over the individual lead for pitching wins with six, but it was the usual team effort that led the Lakers to an 8-3 victory over Seekonk and second-straight South Coast Conference championship last Thursday. Sean Busse and Aiden Blake combined for seven hits and six RBIs while four other teammates (Dylan Raposo, Bryant Connolly, Brady Ouellette and Hayden Lens) each chipped in with one to lead an 11-hit attack. … Busse’s four-hit game was his second of the season. He had four hits in a 14-1 rout of Old Rochester back on April 17. … Apponequet and Seekonk played three times this season with the Lakers winning them all by scores of 5-1, 8-2 and 8-3. The teams won the respective Blue and Gold Divisions in the South Coast Conference, with the latest win coming in the crossover conference championship game. … Matt Bogie tied Fahey for the team lead in wins with six after pitching a complete-game, two-hit, 2-0 shutout over Fairhaven on Friday. The Notebook’s personal MVP of the team? Any name will do, but our nod goes to Busse for his outstanding defensive work behind the plate, the way he handles the pitching staff and for his ability to spray the ball all around the field while hitting from the left side of the plate. \n",
      " BISHOP STANG: Statistically speaking, they are as good a one-two punch as there is in the area. As batterymates, pitcher Jack Sefrino and catcher Luke Bala are second to none. Heading into the final few days of the regular season, Sefrino had a 6-0 pitching record and a microscopic ERA of just over 1.00 while his catcher, Bala, was among the best hitters in the state with a batting average of .636 and had pounded out 28 base hits through the first 15 games. As seniors, they couldn’t end their individual careers on a more impressive note. ... Connor Walsh is a third senior closing out his baseball career at Spartan Village and the infielder has had his share of big moments, like his two hits and one RBI in a 12-5 win over Middleboro and pair of clutch hits in a wild 10-8 victory over Eastern Athletic Conference nemesis Bishop Feehan. The Notebook’s personal MVP of the team? You can’t have one without the other — Sefrino and Bala are the co-winners. \n",
      " DARTMOUTH: Freshman center fielder Javar Williams led the Indians in hitting through much of the season before tailing off a bit over the last couple of weeks, while junior John Correiro has remained consistent throughout and will likely assume that title if he hasn’t already. … Jake Cruz has won five games since fully recovering from injuries and becoming a full-time starting pitcher back in late April. He’s had just one shaky start to date. With Cason Tripp done for the year and Hank Cornell still recovering from injury, coach Mike Frates will mix and match Brandon Aguiar, Colin Boyea and Matt Bernier to fill in behind Cruz down the stretch and into the postseason tournament. The coach has been especially pleased with the efforts of Boyea. “He was used in the relief last season and earlier this season but since the injuries to Tripp and Cornell, he’s stepped into a starting role and, for the most past, has done a nice job,” Frates said. The Notebook’s personal MVP of the team? Correiro. The catcher puts the ball in play consistently and has been a multiple-hit machine for a team that has to score runs and play good defense to offset a pitching staff thinned by injury and he does both. \n",
      " FAIRHAVEN: Brady Coppa went into the final weekend of the regular season with a team-leading 18 base hits and was one of six Blue Devils hitting over .300. Ian Conte’s .379 led the way followed by Logan Berube (.340), Coppa and Brendan DaSilva (both .333), Troy Lopes (.326) and Garrett Brunnette (.310). … Coppa led the pitching staff with a record of 4-2, a 2.89 ERA and three complete games and coach Rudy Bulgar singled out Jacob Krosschell, Ben Bowcock and DaSilva as having pitched well. … Although shoddy defense proved costly to the Blue Devils in more than a few games, Bulgar was quick to praise Lopes, who he labeled “one of the top catchers in the area,” Brady Becotte “who has been a great find at second base” and Nate Couto “who has been solid in centerfield.” Dominic Ramous, who had played very well defensively in centerfield earlier in the season, was moved to shortstop where he also showed a solid glove and Boston Roderiques showed range and a good glove at multiple positions including shortstop, left field, third base and second base. The Notebook’s personal MVP of the team? Coppa for his prowess as a pitcher and productive bat. \n",
      " GNB VOC-TECH: Ethan Perry went into the final two games of the regular season leading the team in hitting with his .370 average, just three points ahead of teammate Ben Frias, who was hitting .367. Austin Francis was another player hitting over .300 with his .315 average. Perry and Frias are juniors; Francis is a senior… At 9-9, the Bears had to win one of their two remaining games (Old Colony on Saturday night and the SCC crossover game on Monday against Fairhaven) to qualify for the postseason tournament. … Freshman Payton Leandre has come on strong of late and was moved up in the Bears’ batting order in an effort to get the infielder more at-bats. … A pair of sophomores top the Bears’ pitching statistics with Gio Arzuaga leading in wins with four and in strikeouts with 47 in 47 innings of work. Angel Quinones has two wins and has fashioned an earned run average of 1.05 in 20 innings or work. The Notebook’s personal MVP of the team? He wasn’t overpowering as a pitcher and didn’t hit for an eye-popping batting average but Arzuaga led the team in wins and drove in key runs to help spark a handful of other victories. \n",
      " NEW BEDFORD: The Whalers’ do-or-die season will be shaped Sunday night at 6 when Durfee invades Paul Walsh Field. With a win, New Bedford would earn a share of the Big 3 championship and advance to the upcoming postseason tournament, while a loss would send the Whalers packing. Durfee is already in the tournament but by beating New Bedford, the Hilltoppers would go in as the outright Big 3 champion. … Xavier Dominguez, Franyk Jaime and Ian DaCosta enter tonight’s final regular season game hitting above the .300 mark and all three will be back again next season. DaCosta, a freshman who stands about 5-9 and weighs in the neighborhood of 165 pounds, has played excellent defense at both second base and shortstop and, as a hitter, the first-year player drew the highest praise from his head coach who called him “the best freshman I’ve had since Andrew Rapoza.” … Jaime, a sophomore, made the transition from third base last season to right field this season and, according to Seed, “the ball jumps off his bat and he can take the outside pitch and hit rockets to right and right-center field.” … Dominguez is a junior who players center field when he isn’t pitching. The “X-Man” bats right, throws left and will be on the mound to face Durfee tonight. The Notebook’s personal MVP of the team? The young guys (DaCosta, Jaime and CJ Dunston were impressive, but Dominguez was Seed’s ‘go-to” guy all season long. \n",
      " OLD COLONY: Jacob Worden joined teammate Nick Hedlund as five-game winners when the senior right-hander was credited with a 4-2 victory over GNB Voc-Tech last week in the first of two scheduled meetings between the Vocational schools. It was the second straight win for Worden, who is 5-3 on the year. Hedlund, who is just a junior, ran his record to 5-1 with a 5-2 victory over Tri-County, avenging a tough 3-1 loss to the Franklin Cougars a week earlier. … The playoff pairings will be announced on Tuesday and printed in Wednesday’s newspaper and either Worden or Hedlund is likely to be on the mound when the Cougars begin postseason play. ... The Notebook’s personal MVP of the team? There’s a lot of candidates here with Worden, Hedlund, Matt Bumpus and Hunter Soares leading the procession. We’ll give the nod to the senior, Worden, who consistently asks for the ball in tough situations with Comeback Player of the Year honors going to Soares who missed his sophomore season following back surgery. \n",
      " OLD ROCHESTER: According to coach Steve Carvalho, Adam Breault went into the final week of the regular season leading the South Coast Conference in batting average, home runs and RBIs. The senior slugger has had some productive games in his final season with the Bulldogs including a big three-run home run to spark a 12-11 extra-inning victory over Case; a two-run shot in a 10-5 win over GNB Voc-Tech and a pair of hits and run-batted-in to key a 2-1 victory over Bourne. Other big games included a three-hit, two-RBI effort in a win over Somerset Berkley and three-hit, three RBI game in a victory over Fairhaven. The Notebook’s personal MVP of the team? Mr. Breault, for all of the above reasons. \n",
      " WAREHAM: The Pearle Brothers, senior Matt and sophomore Joe, who went into the weekend as the team’s two biggest offensive threats. Matt had a team-leading batting average of .475 while hitting out of the third spot in the order, while Joe is a contact hitter who had struck out only three times in the first 18 games while hitting over .300 out of the two spot. … Junior Erik Zine, who was considered the ace of the pitching staff prior to the season, injured his knee two weeks ago and had been limited to mostly designated hitter duty the past few outings. Coach Cabe was hoping to have the hard-throwing right-hander back on the mound for one of the final two regular-season games and the righthander was, indeed, back on the mound throwing gas again in Friday’s 3-1 victory over Case for his third win in five decisions. ... If Zine is the ace of the staff, junior Bryan Gallagher is, by Cabe’s standards, “our most efficient pitcher.” The right-hander improved his record to 3-3 in his route-going, 8-0, win over Somerset Berkley in which 71 of his 90 pitchers were strikes. He’s also hurled two complete games. … Syler King, a junior, and Matt Pearle complete the four-man starting pitching rotation. The Notebook’s personal MVP of the team? Matt Pearle for his solid around play and team leadership. \n",
      " WESTPORT: Adam Charest finished the season as the Wildcats’ leading hitter with an average of .390. The junior was followed by junior Conor Lecomte and eighth-grader Noah Sowle, both of whom finished with an average of .350. … Lecomte had the most pitching wins with three (he was 3-5) and Max Morotti, another eighth-grader, was 2-1 with an ERA of 3.58 in the month of May after missing April with a fractured clavicle. … Despite ending the season with a 7-13 record, head coach Jay Pacheco was thrilled with the varsity experience gained by his combination of seven eighth-graders and freshmen. “There’s nothing great about the record we had but at least it’s not like having a bad record with mostly seniors on the team and having nothing to look forward to next season,” he said. “These young players got a ton of experience this year and got a lot better as the season went on and we’re all looking forward to the next few seasons.” … The Notebook’s personal MVP of the team? Lecomte was among the team’s leading hitters and played multiple positions for Pacheco’s team including first base, second base and shortstop. He also picked up three of the team’s seven wins with solid pitching efforts. \n",

      " Sánchez threw his hands at Rick Porcello's 2-2 slider well outside the strike zone and poked it an estimated 403 feet to right-center. It was Sánchez's 18th homer, matching his total from an injury-spoiled 2018. \n",

      " For the third straight season, the Division 4 fourth-ranked Hudson baseball team won its way out of districts. The Tigers took down Pittsford 3-0 and routing North Adams-Jerome 16-1 in five innings at its Division 4 district while Addison saw its season come to an end with a 6-3 loss to North Adams in its semifinal. \n",
      " With the win, Hudson advances to the pre-regional at home against the winner of the Colon district Wednesday. \n",
      " Hudson (30-6) got a stellar performance out of its pitchers, led by Jesse Heistan, who threw a no-hitter against Pittsford, striking out 11 and only allowing a single baserunner via a hit batter in the third. Ethan Borck threw a complete game in the championship game, allowing an unearned run on two and two walks while striking out two. \n",
      " “We knew that (Pittsford starter Cage Hodos) would throw well for them,” said Hudson coach Jeremy Beal. “We knew we would have our work cut out for him and he pitched a great game. Credit to Jesse, he did the same thing. He was just dealing. He made pitches and, except for the (hit batter), he was never really in jeopardy of giving up a hit.” \n",
      " All year, Hudson has been able to get offense from everywhere and Friday it was Brenden Childress leading the offense, as he combined to go 2-for-4 with 4 RBIs. Blake Borck went 3-for-6 with a triple, three RBIs and two runs scored. \n",
      " Ethan Borck went 3-for-4 with two runs scored and an RBI while Dylan Smith added two stolen bases, two runs scored and an RBI. Logan Wielfaert and Jackson Miler had a pair of RBIs on a base hit in the title game each while CJ Berro and Camden Shaw both tacked on a singular RBIs. \n",
      " “Our younger guys have done a nice job of coming up and supplying us with some energy,” Beal said. “It was good for us to be able to kind of pay them back and get them into the game and have a couple guys have success, get their first varsity hits. Great for us, great for morale and great to kind of keep energy going moving forward.” \n",
      " Addison’s Kenny Jarchow was the hard-luck loser against the Rams, throwing six innings, allowing three runs (two earned), on seven hits with nine strikeouts and two walks. Caden Karabetsos pitched the seventh, allowing two runs on one hit and three walks with one strikeout. \n",
      " “Kenny’s been a horse all year,” said Addison coach Richard Gramm. “He’s only a sophomore. Kid’s like a strikeout machine. Even in conference, kid would average about eight strikeouts a game. I mean, he throws. He goes to the max and gives me everything he’s got. I’ll be glad to have him for the next two seasons.” \n",
      " Zac Conley led the Panthers going 2-for-2 with an RBI while Chris McCollum added another RBI on a base hit with three other Addison hitters (Travis Whitaker, Kobe Farrow and Nick Bowditch) adding a single base hit each in the semifinal. \n",
      " The Tigers will play at 5 p.m. Wednesday back at home against 18th-ranked Colon in the regional semifinal after Colon defeated Athens Friday in its district final. \n",

      " NEW YORK (AP) — DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",
      " Rafael Devers homered early for the third-place Red Sox, who fell 8½ games back in the division. That's the furthest they've been behind the Yankees since finishing the 2015 season nine games in the dust. \n",

      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",
      " REDS 9, NATIONALS 3 \n",
      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",
      " Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto's 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. \n",
      " Cincinnati's Joey Votto returned after missing three games with a tight right hamstring and had three hits. Eugenio Suarez was back in the lineup after getting hit on the left hand by Clay Holmes' pitch on Wednesday. \n",
      " TWINS 5, RAYS 3 \n",
      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking, two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and Minnesota beat Tampa Bay in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " ROCKIES 13, BLUE JAYS 6 \n",
      " DENVER (AP) — Trevor Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and the Colorado Rockies beat the slumping Toronto Blue Jays for their sixth straight win. \n",
      " It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. \n",
      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",
      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. \n",

      " BALTIMORE (AP) — Dwight Smith's first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Núñez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home as the teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. Núñez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",

The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",

      " Charlie Tilson hit a two-run double to get Chicago's offense rolling. Tilson, Yoán Moncada, Yonder Alonso and Yolmer Sánchez each had two hits. The win moved the White Sox into a second-place tie in the AL Central with Cleveland. \n",
      " The Indians committed four errors. Four of Chicago's six runs against slumping Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer were unearned. \n",
      " Covey (1-4) settled down after allowing a leadoff homer to Francisco Lindor and scattered eight hits and ended a personal six-game losing streak. Josh Osich and Juan Minaya followed with three innings of one-hit relief. \n",

He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",

      " Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases.

That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a dental procedure) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. \n",

      " JARED BOMBA | The Daily Star South Kortright pitcher Austin Lamport delivers during the sixth inning of Friday’s Section IV Class D final in Sidney. \n",
      " SIDNEY — How many runs are 49 days of preparation worth in a baseball game? \n",
      " The answer is 14, if Friday’s Section IV Class D final is any indication. \n",
      " No. 4 seed South Kortright took revenge on a 3-0 regular-season loss to Schenevus, beating the Dragons, 14-3, to win the program’s first section baseball title in a decade behind offensive production throughout the lineup and a strong outing on the mound from Austin Lamport. \n",
      " “I knew last game they scored three, and we were having trouble hitting,” Lamport said. “Now we are hitting and it’s tough to stop us. Every single one of us.” \n",
      " Third-seeded Schenevus matched its run output from the season’s first matchup in the bottom of the first as Aydin Schallert drove in Chris Walke, and Owen Schneider recorded two RBI with a single. But Lamport (6-2) settled down, shutting out the Dragons in the next six innings and earning the complete-game victory. \n",
      " Schenevus sent three batters to the plate in three of its final six at-bats. Lamport totaled three strikeouts and zero walks, allowing eight hits, four of which came in the first. The complete-game effort also gave Lamport all three wins in the section tournament. \n",
      " “He was great. After that first inning he loosened up a little bit and relaxed, threw strikes and relied on his defense,” SK coach Bob VanValkenburgh said. “He didn’t strikeout that many, but he got a couple in key spots, and he pitched another great game for us.” \n",
      " Lamport gave SK a chance, and the Rams’ offense did let it go to waste, totaling 19 hits. The SK scoring started with a six-run second inning after the Dragons took their 3-0 lead. Lamport reached on a walk, and scored two batters later as Logan Firment notched a RBI double. Brandon Grommeck followed with another double, plating Firment. \n",
      " Eighth hitter Derek Burns drove in Grommeck with a single, and nine batter Joe Krupa kept the inning going with a single. \n",
      " “We’ve been in a groove the last couple of games and everybody has been hitting the ball,” Burns said. “It feels good because everyone’s confidence is high. When you get up there, you just think you’re going to get a hit.” \n",
      " The top of the Rams lineup then took its turn doing damage as Aidan Fox recorded a RBI single and Chris Champlin drove in a pair to give SK six in the inning. Champlin’s hit chased Schenevus ace Chris Walke with two outs in the second as Aydin Schallert took over. \n",
      " “The kids have worked hard, and the last few weeks we have really started hitting the ball,” VanValkenburgh said. “Once we made it past the first inning, it showed a lot of heart for them to come back and get those runs in the second. That gave us a lot of confidence.” \n",
      " After a scoreless third, Burns and Krupa started another rally with a pair of hits for SK in the fourth. They eventually scored on singles by Fox and Champlin, respectively, before Tyler Hall laced a two-RBI single to make the deficit 10-3 in the middle of the fourth. \n",
      " “It makes it a lot easier. If everyone’s hitting and I can just focus on pitching, it’s a lot easier on me,” Lamport said. \n",
      " Schneider, who shut out the Rams in the previous meeting, took over for Schallert in the fourth, but had no greater luck in quieting the SK bats. The Rams scored one in the fifth and one in the sixth before leadoff hits from Logan Kaufman and Fox saw Schenevus coach Tim Walke replace Schneider with starter Chris Walke. \n",
      " “I’m very proud of my kids. Of course you set your goals high, but South Kortright is a heck of a ball club,” Schenevus coach Tim Walke said. “They hit three different pitchers, so hat’s off to them but I’m very proud of my boys.” \n",
      " Fox and Champlin both had three hits, each totaling three RBI and a run. Kaufman was 3-for-5, while Krupa and Burns each had two hits and two runs. Hall had three RBI for the Rams, which had all nine starters reach base at least once. \n",
      " Schneider went 2-for-3 with two RBI, while Schallert was 2-for-3 with a run and a RBI. Walke was 2-for-4 with a run for the Dragons, which end the season at 13-4. \n",
      " The win gives SK its first baseball section title since 2009, and a first section championship this school year after falling just short in two other seasons that saw them enter section play seeded higher than their four seed in baseball. The Rams fell in the soccer section final as the second seed and in the semifinals of the basketball tournament as the top seed, with both teams featuring several players on the baseball roster. \n",
      " “As we go along and win game by game, every game our confidence gets higher and higher,” Burns said of coming from the fourth seed. “It feels great. We’ve wanted one all school year, and to finally get one is awesome.” \n",
      " “We’ve had good runs in soccer and basketball pretty consistently. In baseball, we’ve been competitive but these kids love baseball,” VanValkenburgh said. “Not many teams I’ve coached have had many where it’s their favorite sport, but for a lot of these kids it is. And a lot of them have sectional experience and I think that carries over.” \n",
      " The Rams advance into the regional final against the winner of the Section III Class D tournament. The regional final is slated for Saturday, June 8 at 3 p.m. on the camous of Onondaga Community College. \n",

      " Gallo's slam sends Rangers past Royals \n",
      " e-mail \n",
      " Joey Gallo's first career grand slam highlighted a six-run sixth inning and helped the Texas Rangers even their four-game set against the visiting Kansas City Royals with a 6-2 victory on Friday night at Arlington, Texas. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) delivered a second straight strong start, giving up two runs and striking out six in six innings for the Rangers, who bounced back from a 4-2 loss to the Royals on Thursday. However, it was Gallo's 16th homer of the season and first in seven games that was the difference. \n",
      " Texas was stymied for five innings by Kansas City's Danny Duffy (3-2) until the home side broke through in a major way while batting around in the sixth. \n",
      " With Texas trailing 2-0, Elvis Andrus delivered an RBI single to cut the deficit in half, and the Rangers tied the score when Nomar Mazara drew a bases-loaded walk. Gallo, the next batter, crushed a 1-1 pitch just to the right of straightaway center field to break the tie and chase Duffy with one out in the inning. \n",
      " The home run by Gallo was just his third hit in 22 at-bats over his past seven games. However, it proved to be more than enough to send the Rangers to their third victory in four games after they lost three in a row. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, Chris Martin and Shawn Kelley each pitched a scoreless inning of relief for Texas, which has won 20 of the past 25 meetings against Kansas City. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert, called up by the Royals from Triple-A Omaha earlier Friday, homered in his first at-bat of 2019, a solo shot in the second inning. Alex Gordon came through with an RBI triple in the fifth for the Royals, who have lost seven of the past nine. \n",
      " Kansas City's Whit Merrifield had two hits. He is 7-for-17 in the past four games. \n",

      " Webster’s season ends with a 37-13 record. \n",
      " W&J struck first, scoring two runs in the bottom of the first inning. Webster responded with two runs in the top of the second, but the Presidents regained the lead in its half of the second. \n",
      " The remainder of the game was pitchers’ duel as neither team scored in the final seven innings. \n",
      " Nick Drake (5-2) started on the mound for W&J and went 5 1/3 innings. He gave up eight hits and two runs but did not walk a batter. Michael Zito followed with 1 2/3 innings of relief before Clay Martin pitched two scoreless innings for his 12th save. Martin tied the school record for career saves with 13. \n",

After Socha walked, Griffin gave W&J a 3-2 advantage when the Webster catcher threw the baseball into left field on a pickoff attempt as Socha stole second base. \n",
      " From that point, the pitching took over. The top of the ninth inning did present some confusion. Webster had a runner on second base with one out when the home-plate umpire thought W&J had signaled for an intentional walk, which would have put the potential winning run on base. After Presidents coach Jeff Mountain questioned the umpire about the decision, the batter was returned from first base to home plate and eventually flied out for the second out. A groundout ended the game. \n",

      " BATON ROUGE — Brandt Broussard's first college home run highlighted his three-hit, four-RBI performance, and LSU raced to a 10-run lead in the first three innings en route to a 17-3 triumph over Stony Brook in an NCAA tournament opener on Friday night. \n",
      " LSU starter Landon Marceaux (5-2) allowed one earned in five innings while the Tigers (38-24) pounded out 10 hits and scored all of their runs. \n",
      " Antoine Duplantis had three hits and drove in three runs. His single to center in the fifth put him in a tie with Eddy Furniss (1995-98) for first in Tigers history with 352 career hits. The crowd rose and roared as Duplantis stood on first, and the senior outfielder from Lafayette, Louisiana, tipped his helmet. \n",
      " The victory placed LSU in a winner's bracket game Saturday night against Southern Mississippi (39-19), which defeated Arizona State 15-3 earlier Friday in the Baton Rouge regional. The Sun Devils (37-18) and Seawolves (31-22) were slated to play an elimination game Saturday afternoon. \n",
      " Stoney Brook starter Greg Marino (5-5) allowed seven runs — two earned — before leaving the mound after Duplantis' run-scoring single in the second. \n",
      " The Tigers scored their first five runs with two outs in the first inning after a throwing error, hit batter and walk loaded the bases. Marino walked in a run before Saul Garza's opposite field double down the right field line cleared the bases and Broussard's single drove in Garza. \n",
      " Zach Watson's two-run homer in the second put LSU up 9-1. \n",

      " Kole Calhoun \n",
      " smacked a go-ahead two-run homer in the eighth inning to lift the Angels to a 6-3 win over the Mariners on Saturday at T-Mobile Park. The Halos have now won six of their last eight games. \n",
      " Heaney, making his second start of the season after missing the first two months with left elbow inflammation, was impressive, striking out 10 without issuing a walk over six strong innings. But he had trouble facing Edwin Encarnacion, as he gave up a solo homer to him in the fourth and a game-tying two-run blast to him in the sixth on a full count. \n",
      " • Box score \n",
      " \"I had good stuff,\" Heaney said. \"You want to get more out of days like today. Obviously, in the situation of the game, that's not what I'm trying to do there with the 3-2 pitch. He capitalized on it. Obviously, he was seeing it well. It's something I'll take a look at and going forward, I'll have to make some adjustments.\" \n",
      " That stuck Heaney with a no-decision, but Calhoun came to the rescue with his two-run homer off lefty Roenis Elias with two outs in the eighth. It was Calhoun’s 12th of the year and his fifth off a left-hander. He's been heating up, as he hit .299/.394/.552 in 25 games in May after batting .194/.281/.435 in 28 games in March/April. \n",
      " “He took a couple of good swings on fastballs prior to the home run,” manager Brad Ausmus said. “Kole has swung the bat pretty well overall recently, even against lefties. He hangs in there well.” \n",
      " Calhoun’s clutch blast helped make up for the two homers surrendered by Heaney to Encarnacion. The first one came on a 1-0 changeup, while the second was on a hanging curveball on a 3-2 count. Heaney's curveball was otherwise his best pitch, as he recorded eight of his strikeouts with it. \n",
      " “It was good today,\" Heaney said of his curve. \"I think the fastball sets it up. So I think being in the zone and getting some swing-throughs definitely puts some pressure on them to make a decision.” \n",
      " Heaney registered an impressive 22 swings and misses, including 15 with his curve and seven with his sinker. It was tied for the fifth-most swinging strikes induced by an Angels pitcher since Statcast was introduced in 2015. It set a career best for Heaney; the best by an Angels pitcher since 2015 is 25, by both Matt Shoemaker (May 27, 2016) and Shohei Ohtani (April 9, 2018). \n",

      " It was a similar showing to his season debut against the Rangers on Sunday, when he struck out eight over five solid innings but was hurt by a pair of solo homers. Heaney has struck out 18 in 11 innings this year, but has also allowed four homers. \n",
      " “If I keep the ball in the yard, I think I have two completely different starts,” Heaney said. “It goes from being two kinda mediocre starts to maybe two really good ones. That's obviously kind of the name of the game now, keep the ball in the yard. It's something I'll take a look at and see if there are any adjustments I need to make to do that better.\" \n",

      " Pujols joins Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski, Eddie Murray and Barry Bonds as the only players to hit at least 10 homers in each of their first 19 seasons. No player has ever reached 20 consecutive. \n",

      " added an insurance run in the ninth on a solo shot off reliever Chasen Bradford. It was Trout’s team-leading 14th blast of the year and his second this series.

      " GREENSBORO – Randleman High School’s Matt Kemp threw 108 pitches in Game 1 of the NCHSAA 2A state championship series against North Lincoln on Saturday. \n",
      " There’s only one he wishes he could have back. \n",
      " North Lincoln scored two runs on a Jake Soorus single in the third inning and that turned out to be the only scoring in the game, as the Knights topped Randleman 2-0 to take a 1-0 series lead in the best-of-three series at UNC Greensboro. \n",
      " Kemp threw five innings for RHS, allowing three hits and two runs with four walks and 11 strikeouts. He matched North Lincoln’s Joey Cobb nearly pitch for pitch – Cobb threw a four-hit complete-game shutout with four walks and 11 strikeouts – except for the Soorus hit that proved to be the difference. \n",
      " “Both sides did a great job (pitching),” Randleman baseball coach Jake Smith said. “Matt did a great job.” \n",
      " Landon Reeves led off the third for the Knights with a walk and was sacrificed to second by Sam Brady before Matt Heavner reached on a bloop single that fell between Randleman players. \n",
      " After a strikeout, Soorus came to the plate with two outs. He worked to a 3-2 count then hit a line drive to left to plate Reeves and Heavner, giving the Knights the 2-0 lead they would not relinquish. \n",
      " “That was a lack of communication on a fly ball,” Smith said. “That cost us a couple of runs – the (Soorus) hit never happens if the fly ball gets caught.” \n",
      " The pitchers duel saw just eight combined hits, with four by North Lincoln, and did not have an extra-base hit until Owen Strickland doubled for Randleman in the sixth. \n",
      " Randleman got the leadoff batter on base four times but failed to capitalize. Strickland walked in the first before the next three batters made outs, Brooks Brannon singled in the third but was wiped out by a double play and Dawson Edwards singled in the fourth before the next three batters made outs. \n",
      " In the sixth, after Strickland’s double led off the inning, the next two batters struck out. Kemp walked, but the next batter also struck out to end the frame. \n",
      " Down to their last out in the seventh, Brannon – the only player for either team with multiple hits – singled for Radnleman before the game ended on a fielder’s choice groundout. \n",
      " “We didn’t hit the ball well enough to win,” Smith said. “But give credit to their pitcher. He put pressure on us and made us swing the bats.” \n",
      " Outside of the pivotal third inning, North Lincoln had just one runner advance to second base. Tanner Brumfield and Daniel Carter each walked in the fourth, leaving runners at first and second with one out, but Kemp escaped the jam. \n",

      " For the eighth consecutive year, LSU has won its regional opener. The 14-run win is the largest margin of victory in a regional opener since the Tigers opened the 2000 regional opener with a 19-1 win against Jackson State and is the fifth double-digit regional opening victory since 1996 (’97, ’98, ’00, ’08, ’19). \n",

With the bases loaded and two outs, first baseman  Chris Reid  drew a walk before catcher  Saul Garza  cleared the bases with a double down the right field line. Second baseman followed with a RBI single to center field to round out the five-run first inning. \n",
      " In the bottom of the second inning with shortstop  Josh Smith  on second base after a single and a stolen base, Duplantis slapped an RBI single up the middle. With runners in scoring position after a base hit by left fielder  Daniel Cabrera , designated hitter  Cade Beloso  hit a sacrifice fly to left field to bring in Duplantis. Center fielder  Zach Watson  then hit a moon shot to left field for his sixth home run of the year, a two-run blast, to put the Tigers up 9-1. \n",
      " Duplantis drove in two runs in the bottom of the third with his single through the right side to extend the LSU lead to 11-1. \n",

      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pittsburgh Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin in a 9-4 victory Friday night. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Archer struck out seven and walked two while needed only 92 pitches to get 21 outs as the injury-ravaged Pirates won for only the third time in their last 11 games. \n",
      " Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command briefly abandoned him in the third inning. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh's lead to 5-1. Peralta replaced Chacin and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh's advantage to 7-1. \n",
      " Chacin — a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series — saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " Aguilar hit his first home run in a month when he took Archer to the bushes beyond the center-field wall in leading off the third. Hiura pushed Milwaukee's home run total to 98 — tops in the National League — with a three-run shot to center in fourth. \n",
      " Hiura had three of Milwaukee's six hits, but the second baseman was also charged with two of the Brewers' three errors on a funky play in the seventh when a liner by Jacob Stallings deflected off Peralta's glove to Hiura, who couldn't corral it initially, then threw into the Milwaukee dugout when he rushed his throw in an effort to get Stallings. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Brewers: C Manny Pina (right hamstring discomfort) is expected to rejoin Milwaukee over the weekend. Pina is hitting .300 (3 for 10) during a rehab stint with Class A Wisconsin entering Friday. \n",
      " Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles (left hamstring discomfort) will start Sunday's series finale. Lyles exited a loss to Cincinnati last Tuesday after tweaking the hamstring in the fourth inning. ... RHP Keone Kela will be shut down for 10 days after the right shoulder discomfort that sent him to the injured list popped back up during a rehab assignment. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Brewers: Brandon Woodruff (7-1, 3.22 ERA) will look for his seventh straight win on Saturday. Woodruff entered the season with five career victories spread across 2017 and 2018. He limited the Phillies to one run in eight innings last Sunday. \n",
      " Pirates: Nick Kingham (1-1, 8.28) hasn't won a game as a starter since last July, but will get the nod on Saturday. Kingham — who has bounced between the bullpen and the rotation this season — allowed three runs in 4 2/3 innings against Cincinnati on Monday. \n",

      " ATLANTA, Ga. (WCTV) -- Florida A&M fell behind early to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and couldn't keep the momentum in their favor in the middle innings as they dropped their first game in regional play, 13-2, on Friday night at Russ Chandler Stadium. \n",
      " Georgia Tech scored runs in each of the first three innings of the game against FAMU starter Kyle Coleman, who was unable to settle himself down in the early going (though three Rattler errors in each of those innings didn't help things). \n",
      " Tech's first runs came in the bottom of the first, when leadoff walks were issued to Luke Waddell and Michael Guldberg to set the table for Kyle McCann, who singled into right field but, but the ball was misplayed by right fielder Jared Weber, allowing two runs to score to give the Yellow Jackets a 2-0 lead. \n",
      " McCann slipped while rounding second and was tagged out. \n",
      " GT added to their lead in the second on an equally weird play. \n",
      " Waddell singled into left field with two on, both of which reached via lead off walks, but Seyjuan Lawrence made a good play to get to the ball and hold the lead runner at third, which would have loaded the bases, if not for  the Rattlers agreeing to Jackson Webb's game of pickle, which led to an errant throw home and his scoring, making it 3-0. \n",
      " Two batters later, Tristin English hit a long, loud sacrifice fly to score another run, making it 4-0. \n",
      " Another sacrifice fly, off the bat of Nick Wilhite, gave Tech a 5-0 lead in the third. \n",
      " From there, Coleman settled down tremendously, never facing more than four batters in the same inning for the rest of his outing. He was taken out after 5.2 innings of work, allowing five runs on nine hits, seven walks and four strikeouts. \n",
      " The Rattlers, despite being quiet on the scoreboard in the early frames, made good early contact against GT starter Amos Willingham but weren't able to break through in the early going, sending four batters the the plate in the first but the minimum in the second, third and fourth. \n",
      " FAMU's offensive fortunes changed in the fifth, sending eight batters to the plate and scoring twice. \n",
      " Willis McDaniel led the inning off by getting hit by a pitch, Lawrence singled  and Kaycee Reese drew a walk to load the bases for Brett Maxwell, who hit a sacrifice fly to center field to score McDaniel and pull the Rattlers within 5-1. \n",
      " The next at-bat, Ryan Coscarella laid down a perfect bunt up the first base line as part of a suicide squeeze that scored Lawrence and put Coscarella safe at first base, making for a 5-2. \n",
      " FAMU proceeded to load the bases again - Robert Robinson reached on a fielder's choice and Octavien Moyer was hit by a pitch - to set the table for Tucker Rayburn, who struck out swinging to end the threat. \n",
      " After that inning, the Rattlers wouldn't put runs on the board, despite leaving runners on base in the next three frames, including a wasting a pair of lead off doubles in the sixth and seventh. \n",
      " Georgia Tech added five runs in the bottom of the seventh inning and three in the bottom of the eighth to take their eventual winning 13-2 lead. \n",

      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. \n",

      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Tanner Roark's first career homer wasn't enough to get the win against his former Nationals teammates. Instead, it went to the other half of the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " \"A weird day,\" Nationals starter Eric Fedde said. \n",
      " Except for the outcome. Nothing surprising about the Nationals winning in Cincinnati. \n",
      " Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Nationals to a 5-2 victory — their ninth in 10 games at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason for Tanner Rainey. Both pitchers came away with a career moment. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Fedde, his first in 336 career plate appearances. \n",
      " \"I felt like my emotions were under control,\" said Roark, who went six innings. \"It's definitely a tough loss. The bunt and the home run felt good. I would've rather have won the game.\" \n",
      " Two homers made the difference. \n",
      " Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 36 2/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Rainey (1-1), who got into the game in the fifth. He acknowledged that he had extra motivation facing his former team, and he fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. \n",
      " \"For me getting the first win in here, it is special,\" Rainey said. \n",
      " Rainey fanned Yasiel Puig with a runner on third to end the fifth inning, and then struck out two more batters in the sixth. \n",
      " \"He's going to be a good one, he really is,\" manager Dave Martinez said. \"He has that look when he comes out of the bullpen that I really like,\" \n",
      " Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Washington's Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. It was the longest hitting streak by a player under age 21 since Manny Machado also hit in 14 straight games in 2013. \n",

      " WATCH: The Metaphysics of Money \n",
      " 10 months ago \n",
      " The 7 Laws of Abundance \n",
      " The following is the full transcript: \n",
      " Hi, good afternoon. This is Deepak and I have an interesting topic to discuss with you today. I’m calling it “The Metaphysics Of Money- The Seven Laws Of Abundance.” \n",
      " One of the reasons I chose this topic is that I find that money is the main cause of misery and unhappiness in a lot of people. We’ve heard the expression in the Bible that the root of all evil is money or the love of money or something like that. And so, is there some truth to it? \n",
      " I find two categories of people who are usually extremely unhappy when it comes to money: those who are very poor and those who are extremely rich. The reason I believe is that all they think about is money. So, if all you think about is money, if your identity is tied to money, and if all your all your behavior and interactions with people and the world are around money, then you’re likely to be unhappy. \n",
      " And, yet money is also required to make a living, to survive, to buy goods and services, to take vacations, to pay bills. It’s part of our life and without money the world would come to a stop. \n",
      " So, I thought maybe I would share with you some ideas of what money is and how to create wealth consciousness. But even beyond that, how to experience wealth consciousness as a fundamental reality of our being, of our nature. \n",
      " I asked many people what they thought about this topic the metaphysics of money, the seven laws of abundance. And some of them said they didn’t like the phrase the metaphysics of money and some said well it’s probably similar to the seven spiritual laws of success and therefore there’s nothing new to it. \n",
      " So what I thought is I’ll share this with you and then you tell me whether this is worth pursuing because I could theoretically do a book on it if you want. But I’d love but I’d love your feedback, okay, on the title “the metaphysics of money” and also the subtitle “the seven laws of abundance.” \n",
      " And what you think about these titles and whether you think I should pursue this in greater detail. I’d love that feedback from you and look for it and it will definitely influence my decision to elaborate on this, okay? \n",
      " So, a lot of people of course you know not familiar with the word metaphysics. Some call it whew and mumbo-jumbo. But essentially metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things, including abstract concepts such as the nature of being, fundamental reality. hat is the nature of knowing, what is the nature of substance, what is cause and effect, what is space and time? These are things that metaphysics deals with. \n",
      " Some people are saying the book would be amazing. So that’s good. Yes I’m getting feedback. Yes, please do this book. So let’s see, okay? \n",
      " So, having explained what metaphysics is, let me go to very fundamental things. The first thing you have to understand and by now if you’re following me on these videos, then you’ll agree with me that money is a human creation. It is a human construct. In other words, we made it up. just like we made up latitude and longitude and Greenwich Mean Time, we made up the concept of money. \n",
      " It’s our collective agreement on how we value things and how we exchange values. So before there was money, basically there was barter. You know, I’ll give you a haircut and you repair my shoe. I’ll give you my chicken and you can help me be wash the dishes. So, basically it was exchanging services and exchanging things that we didn’t have for things that we had. \n",
      " It was pretty inconvenient, so people started creating little symbols. It was coins, little pieces of metal, copper or anything and that could represent value.  Okay, so instead of me giving you a haircut and you repairing my shoe, we use this little symbol. And then ultimately it became paper. And basically, it said I owe you this, and this is how you can spend it. And so money started. \n",
      " Along with money started commerce and along with other human constructs. We ended up with empires and nation-states and what we call human civilization, and a creation of our collective consciousness. That’s the origin of money. \n",
      " And now, of course, money rules the world. There are countries so poor that they have huge problems: epidemics, violence, and all kinds of corruption and cronyism and influence peddling and issues like money laundering. Money laundering is an essential part of how big organizations indulge in terrorism. Without money, you can’t go to war. \n",
      " And, so money is creating problems in very poor countries and it’s no different in very rich countries. Money is the source of corruption and cronyism and influence-peddling, and bureaucracy, and violence, and greed, and everything that we are troubled by that creates anguish and unhappiness. \n",
      " So, what is the best way to understand money? And what is the best way to generate it? What is the best way to spend it and \n",
      " what is the best way to earn it? And with that in mind, I created these seven laws that follow the same principles of the seven spiritual laws. Okay? And I’m going to call them the seven laws of abundance. \n",
      " The first law of abundance is that the source of abundance is infinite. \n",
      " Once again, the source of abundance is infinite. Why? Because the source of every experience is consciousness and consciousness is by definition non-local. It has no form and therefore it’s infinite. \n",
      " And the source of all experience is infinite. Therefore, it can never be in short supply. So, if we think deeply about this first law, the source of abundance is infinite, then of course we want to get in touch with that source. And that source is our innermost being, which is the field of all possibilities, the field of unpredictability, the source of intention and desire, the field that is evolving in the direction of truth, goodness, beauty, harmony, and love. It’s the field that is inexhaustible as a source for ongoing creativity and abundance. \n",
      " And it is simple to get in touch with the source by transcending the mind through meditation, through self-awareness, through self-reflection, through self-inquiry, through mindful awareness of every experience: mindful awareness of body mindful, awareness of the processes of the mind, mindful awareness of the web of relationship, mindful awareness of mental space. \n",
      " And to engage this source of infinite possibilities by asking questions and receiving answers. I’ve been in the habit of doing that every day all my life and reviewing this process every night before I go to sleep. \n",
      " Law number one: the source of abundance is infinite. \n",
      " Law number two: whatever you want to receive (and let’s say this is the second law) whatever you want to receive, start by giving. \n",
      " So, we can, you know, start with simple things. If you want attention, you pay attention to others. Of you want respect, you give respect to others. If you want love, you give your love to everyone that you meet. And respect love, attention, affection, appreciation and acceptance are very simple things to start with. \n",
      " But, if you want to generate wealth, then figure out a way to generate wealth for others. And also figure out how you can activate abundance consciousness in others. And one way to do this is also to experience gratitude. So, when you experience gratitude it opens the door to abundance consciousness. \n",
      " Think of all the things you’re grateful for: material things, relationships health, on and on, career. And as you open the door of gratitude, it leads to the realm of abundance. Start with giving. \n",
      " Once in a while, when I’m in New York City I go to the bank and I get some cash. And then I walk around the city giving cash or dollars to homeless people on the street. And don’t do it casually. Do it sincerely: look them in the eyes, talk to them, and see their reaction when you give them $20 or whatever. You will see the gratitude in their eyes and you’ll feel a connection between spirit and spirit. \n",
      " And, so this exchange (by the way that’s what money is also called the exchange – the currency of exchange), so start with that process and live in that process. \n",
      " Don’t stop the flow of abundance by hoarding money. If you hoard money it’s of no use, right? What are you going to do with it f you just hoard it spend it? Spend it on yourself, spend it on others, spend it on your friends, spend it on charity, spend it for a cause, spend it for an experience. And always think: what’s the best use of the money that I have? \n",
      " Okay that’s number two. \n",
      " Number three and these are just principles right now that I can expand on if you want me to. If you want me to do in this, write about this as I listen for your feedback and I’ll really expand on this. \n",
      " Law number three: money is the exchange of values. \n",
      " In fact, the way a society spends money is a clue to their values. So, right now, most wealthy nations and even some unwealthy nations (poor nations) are spending money on weapons, on mechanized death, on drugs, alcohol, on gambling, on sleazy stuff. And that only represents the collective consciousness of bad money, bad karma. Therefore, stay away from any way that generates money through harm. \n",
      " And this is what the great teacher of all time, the Buddha, he said Right Livelihood. So Right Livelihood is that kind of livelihood that creates joy in the world, that increases abundance in the world, increases and improves the quality of life in the world, ok? Understand that when you’re exchanging money, you’re exchanging values. Ok? \n",
      " Law number four or principle number four: wealth is a state of consciousness. \n",
      " It’s not the amount of money, it is the state of consciousness that you can generate wealth and abundance. And so, what is that state of consciousness? It’s actually a state of consciousness that I call spontaneous creativity. Spontaneous creativity and comes when there is a pause between what we call experience: the gap between thoughts, the gap between intention, the gap between perception, the gap between breath, the space between choices. \n",
      " The same place which I mentioned in the first principle: the infinite self where there is spontaneous creativity. You know when there is spontaneous creativity when there is no resistance, when there is no anticipation, when there is no regret, when you’re totally present and you’re experiencing what is called a flow. Because you know, deep inside you, that your only intention ultimately is the progressive expansion of happiness for yourself and for everyone else. \n",
      " And as you do that, then that spontaneous creativity will activate intention, which will find the creative source for fulfilling that intention. As I’ve said so many times before, intention has organizing power and intention organizes its own fulfillment. \n",
      " So that leads to the fifth principle which is: intention and attention in the field of infinite possibilities is all that matters. \n",
      " Intention and attention in the field in field of infinite possibilities. Have the intention of what you want to create with the abundance you have and then with that intention go and transcend. And when you transcend, you transcend to the source. \n",
      " And there are many ways of transcending: through music, through a walk in nature, through poetry, through dance, through whirling, through meditation, through play, and through collective what I call collective envisioning. \n",
      " Collective envisioning when you have a group of people who have a vision together, when you have an open system, when you’re totally transparent, when you invite even absurd ideas, when you make unlikely connections, then something emerges and we call that emergence. \n",
      " So, create a group for wealth consciousness. And if you create that group and if you are transparent and if you invite unlikely alliances. If you have maximum diversity of people from the arts, from the humanities, from Sciences, from any field technology, mathematics, whatever and you sit and incubate together with attention and intention then emergence happens. It just happens! \n",
      " And the emergence of abundance, in this case, with the proper attention and intention and even collective intention. I know somebody in New York who just raised 450 million dollars \n",
      " through crowdsourcing for creating a place for spiritual enlightenment. But this is how they did it: crowdsourcing with authenticity, with sincerity, with integrity, and with joy. \n",
      " So that leads to the sixth principle: the key to abundance is letting go. \n",
      " In previous books, I have mentioned I think the law of detachment. So, this simply means, process orientation and understanding that no experiences grasp ever. Grasping and clinging actually prevent the flow that intention and attention needs to reach its destination. So, no clinging, no grasping, and letting go is the secret. \n",
      " And finally, the seventh principle: the purpose of wealth of course is to create joy and expand happiness – for us and for everybody else. \n",
      " In a sense, I’ve followed these principles all my life and I have to say that my journey has been one of effortless spontaneity. And I don’t apologize for success. And I don’t apologize for the fact that spirituality can be a source of abundance and wealth. Because if you feel guilty about wealth and you feel guilty about money, then you will end up with guilt and no wealth at the same time. That’s not a good state of being, okay? \n",
      " So these are my seven principles: \n",
      " The source of abundance is infinite \n",
      " What you want to receive start with giving \n",
      " Money is the exchange of values \n",
      " Wealth is the result of spontaneous creativity that resides in every human being \n",
      " Intention and attention is all you need \n",
      " The key to abundance is letting go \n",
      " And finally, never forget the fact that the purpose of life is the progressive expansion of happiness for everyone \n",
      " Now if you want me to expand and be more specific and give you daily practices then encourage me to write the book or else I will move on to something else. \n",
      " Thank you and God bless. \n",

      " PITTSBURGH (AP) - Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pittsburgh Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin in a 9-4 victory Friday night. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Archer struck out seven and walked two while needed only 92 pitches to get 21 outs as the injury-ravaged Pirates won for only the third time in their last 11 games. \n",
      " Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command briefly abandoned him in the third inning. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh's lead to 5-1. Peralta replaced Chacin and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh's advantage to 7-1. \n",
      " Chacin - a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series - saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " Aguilar hit his first home run in a month when he took Archer to the bushes beyond the center-field wall in leading off the third. Hiura pushed Milwaukee's home run total to 98 - tops in the National League - with a three-run shot to center in fourth. \n",
      " Hiura had three of Milwaukee's six hits, but the second baseman was also charged with two of the Brewers' three errors on a funky play in the seventh when a liner by Jacob Stallings deflected off Peralta's glove to Hiura, who couldn't corral it initially, then threw into the Milwaukee dugout when he rushed his throw in an effort to get Stallings. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Brewers: C Manny Pina (right hamstring discomfort) is expected to rejoin Milwaukee over the weekend. Pina is hitting .300 (3 for 10) during a rehab stint with Class A Wisconsin entering Friday. \n",
      " Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles (left hamstring discomfort) will start Sunday's series finale. Lyles exited a loss to Cincinnati last Tuesday after tweaking the hamstring in the fourth inning. ... RHP Keone Kela will be shut down for 10 days after the right shoulder discomfort that sent him to the injured list popped back up during a rehab assignment. \n",

      " CHARLESTON, W.Va. — With standout Jake Carr on the mound Saturday against Wheeling Park, St. Albans coach Rick Whitman didn’t figure his team would need much offense to advance to the Class AAA title game. \n",
      " Fortunately for Whitman, the  was as good as expected and the offense came to life in the fifth inning to lead the Red Dragons to a 4-1 victory in a semifinal at Appalachian Power Park. \n",
      " “We were able to find a way to manufacture a few runs,” Whitman said. “When you have Jake Carr on the mound and you get the lead, everyone feels good. He wasn’t great today, but he grinded it out and gave us everything he had.” \n",
      " The win puts top seed St. Albans (33-4) in Sunday’s AAA title game against No. 2 Hurricane. \n",
      " Carr, a WVU signee, had more difficulty than usual with his location and issued six walks. But he also struck out 11 while working around the control issues and held Wheeling Park (20-10) to one hit through five innings and three hits over 6 2/3 innings. \n",
      " “My velocity was down, and I had six walks and that’s not typical me,” Carr said. “But we got timely hits when it mattered. Since we scored no runs against them last year, I told the guys just give me one run and that’s all I’ll need. They actually gave me four.” \n",
      " St. Albans’ Rick Whitman postgame interview \n",
      " Although Carr walked four over the first three innings, he struck out six, including the side in the second inning. \n",
      " The Red Dragons went on top for good with a run in the home half of the third. Travis Atkins had a one-out infield single, stole second and scored on a two-out double off the bat of leadoff hitter Casey Kemplin. \n",
      " Park produced its first hit in the fourth inning — a two-out double by James Salvatori — but stranded a pair of runners. \n",
      " Carr retired the side in order in the fifth, and when he came back out to toe the rubber in the sixth, the Red Dragons had upped their lead to 4-0. \n",

      " After Atkins stole second, No. 9 hitter Ayden Hodges delivered a single to center to score courtesy runner Brandon Lucas. \n",
      " “Our lineup is pretty solid all the way through and that’s why we’ve won 33 games,” Whitman said. “If the top of the lineup is clicking and the bottom’s not, then that’s OK. But sometimes the bottom has to pick the top up and that’s kind of what happened today.” \n",
      " Hodges’ hit marked the end of Isaac Hines’ outing on the mound, but reliever Trevor Thomas hit Kemplin and walked Carr to bring the Red Dragons’ third run in. Noah Cummings’ sacrifice fly to center made it 4-0. \n",
      " Carr allowed a leadoff triple to Trevor Thomas in the sixth and Thomas scored on Ben Taylor’s groundout to second. \n",
      " Park had a chance to draw closer that inning when it put runners on the corners, but Carr induced an inning-ending fly out off the bat of Bryce Bauer. \n",
      " “Baseball is a game of timely hitting and we couldn’t get a couple of timely hits,” Patriots’ coach Steve Myers said. “But hats off to him. He bared down when he had to and he’s a good pitcher. Our guys fought until the end and that’s the character of them all season. A timely hit or two maybe could’ve changed the outcome.” \n",
      " Carr struck out the first two batters he faced in the seventh before reaching his 110-pitch limit. That brought on Connor Fizer, who yielded a single to Mason Richardson before recording the save. \n",

      " The second day of NCAA regionals brought an early exit for the defending national champion, one of the greatest individual performances in tournament history and an upset of No. 1 national seed UCLA. \n",
      " Oregon State was eliminated on its home field with a 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton on Saturday, marking the first time the Beavers have gone 0-2 in regionals in 14 appearances since 1985. They were knocked out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",
      " \"It was a matter of us not playing good baseball. That's the bottom line,\" OSU interim coach Pat Bailey said. \n",
      " The Beavers lost 10 of their last 15 games and finished 36-20-1 a season after they completed a two-year run in which they won 111 of 130 games under former coach Pat Casey. \n",
      " Sports Videos \n",
      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman's last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " Baylor's Shea Langeliers hit three home runs and doubled while going 5 for 6 and driving in a tournament-record 11 runs in a 24-6 win over Omaha in an elimination game. \n",
      " \"When I was a little kid, I liked to think I was a pretty good hitter, but I think this game will probably be one of the most meaningful games for me as a hitter probably for the rest of my career,\" Langeliers said. \"Our backs were up against the wall and we needed a big game from our offense and we got it. It was a lot of fun.\" \n",
      " Langeliers, who likely will be the second catcher drafted behind Rutschman, broke the NCAA postseason record of 10 RBIs in a game shared by Vanderbilt's Connor Kaiser (2018) and Miami's Kevin Brown (2001). \n",
      " Langeliers' homers were for two, one and three runs. He also had a two-run single and three-run double. \n",
      " Hours after Langeliers' big performance, Loyola Marymount beat UCLA 3-2 on the same field in Los Angeles. The Lions lost twice to the Bruins in the regular season and had dropped seven in a row against them. \n",
      " Cooper Uhl, LMU's 9-hole batter, sent a run-scoring single into right field in the seventh inning to break a 2-2 tie. Nick Frasso earned his second save in two days, striking out three in two shutout innings. \n",
      " UCLA had its 11-game win streak end and must beat Baylor in an elimination game to get a rematch with the Lions in the regional final Sunday night. \n",

      " HE DID IT AGAIN \n",
      " Down to his last strike with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Steven Williams hit a three-run homer to give Auburn a 6-5 walk-off win over Georgia Tech. Williams, the Tigers' 8-hole hitter, homered and drove in five runs Friday against Coastal Carolina. \n",
      " HE DID IT AGAIN, TOO \n",
      " Florida State's Tim Becker, the graduate student who walked on after playing three seasons on the school's club team, homered for the third time in two games in a 12-3 win over Georgia. \n",
      " FSU is a win away from super regionals in Mike Martin's 40th and final season. The Seminoles, a No. 3 regional seed for the first time under Martin and one of the last four teams selected for the tournament, have scored 25 runs in two games. \n",
      " THAT'S QUINNIPIAC, MAC \n",
      " No. 4 regional seed Quinnipiac upset East Carolina 5-4 in a first-round game postponed until Saturday. The Bobcats of Hamden, Connecticut, play third-seeded Campbell in a winners' bracket game Sunday. Quinnipiac went 0-2 in its only previous tournament appearance in 2005. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10 1/2-game lead in the AL Central. \n",
      " “We don’t want our guys getting nicked up or anything, but sometimes you take the baserunners any way you can,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “And sometimes it takes a base hit with men on base to kind of wake everyone up and get things going.” \n",
      " Jose Berrios and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",
      " “It’s something we’ve seen this year. In the games that we have not played our best or lost, we’ve come back the day after and really pulled together and played good baseball,” Baldelli said. “It’s what we’ve come to expect. I think we have the type of guys that regardless of what happens today, they’ll be ready to play tomorrow.” \n",
      " Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " The Twins have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. They trailed 3-1 in the fifth before Polanco drove in a run with his second double and scored on a single by Willians Astudillo. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout. Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo plunked Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",

      " Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. \n",

Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",

      " Gallo's first career grand slam leads Rangers past Royals \n",
      " The Canadian Press \n",
      " Joey Gallo                     , The Canadian Press \n",
      " ARLINGTON, Texas — Joey Gallo stood in centre field trying not to beat himself up after misplaying two fly balls into triples as he and the Texas Rangers trailed the Kansas City Royals by two runs going into the sixth inning. \n",
      " Soon enough, Gallo took out his frustrations on the baseball. \n",
      " Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth inning outburst as the Rangers rallied past the Royals 6-2 Friday night. \n",
      " The Rangers have won five of their last six home games while the Royals have lost of four of their last five overall. \n",
      " Gallo's home run, his team-leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet and landed in the second seating area beyond the centre-field wall. \n",
      " \"Things turned around quick,\" Gallo said. In his first season playing regularly in centre, he also redeemed himself defensively by finishing the game with a diving catch in left-centre on a ball hit by Billy Hamilton. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. Jurado allowed two runs on five hits and three walks. The second-year right-hander, who was recalled from Triple-A Nashville on April 26, had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " All of that on a night when his parents, Ariel Sr. and Yizel, had travelled from Panama to see him pitch in the majors for the first time. \n",
      " \"That was something special,\" Jurado said through an interpreter. \n",
      " With Jurado outpitched by veteran Royals left-hander Danny Duffy through five innings, Rangers manager Chris Woodward thought his youngster deserved a better fate given the circumstances. \n",
      " \"I'm saying a little prayer 'cause the baseball gods should be with us on this one,\" Woodward said. \"Like, I was hoping for three (runs).\" \n",
      " Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26, his first start of the season after recovering from last year's shoulder injury. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, he allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks — both in the sixth. \n",
      " \"This game will rip your heart out sometimes,\" Duffy said. \"But I've got to turn the page after tonight and go back out there, try to be better next time.\" \n",
      " Texas loaded the bases in the sixth inning on outfield singles by Shin-Soo Choo and Elvis Andrus and a chopper hit between third base and the mound by Hunter Pence. Duffy fielded Pence's grounder, but his throw to first base was late. \n",
      " Duffy walked Nomar Mazara with the bases loaded to tie the score 2-2. Gallo then launched a 1-1 fastball to end a six-game homerless streak, which matched his longest this season. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Cuthbert, who earlier Friday had his contract selected from Triple-A Omaha, hit an opposite-field homer that just cleared the right-field wall in the second and also made a standout play at third base. \n",
      " \"He's always been a really good defender at third base for us,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said of Cuthbert. \"That's kind of expected.\" \n",
      " Gordon's triple in the fifth inning turned around Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway centre, scoring Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. \n",
      " All of that was forgotten in the bottom of the sixth. \n",
      " SHORT HOPS \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. ... The Royals lead the majors with 24 triples. ... Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base to give the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",
      " PRE-GAME MOVES \n",
      " To make room for Cuthbert, the Royals designated INF-OF Chris Owings for assignment. The Rangers selected the contract of RHP David Carpenter from Nashville and optioned OF Zack Granite to Nashville. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Royals: OF Hunter Dozier (right thorax tightness) is day to day, leaving Thursday's game in the fifth inning and sitting out Friday. \n",
      " Rangers: OF Willie Calhoun (left quad strain) will begin on-field work on Saturday. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",

He threw 47 of 73 pitches for strikes to improve to 3-1 on the International League season with a 4.00 ERA and 1.25 WHIP.

      " Rays SS Wander Franco, Class A Midwest League: 2-for-4, HR, 2B, 2 RBIs, R -- Already riding a seven-game hitting streak, the top Tampa Bay prospect delivered a two-hit night. After a seven-pitch at-bat in the first inning, Franco cranked a two-run homer to right field, his fifth long ball of the season. In the fifth, he went to right again and legged out his 13th double. The 18-year-old is showing no signs of slowing down in his first full professional season, boasting a .324/.391/.517 slash line.  Gameday box score \n",
      " Braves OF Trey Harris, Class A Rome: 4-for-5, 2 RBIs, R -- Harris has torn up South Atlantic League pitching all season, but Friday marked a different type of dominance for him.

In the process, the University of Missouri product raised his average to .377 and his OPS to an SAL-leading 1.054.

      " Dodgers SS Gavin Lux, Double-A Tulsa: 3-for-5, R -- Lux raked seemingly from start to finish in May, so it's only fitting Los Angeles' second-ranked prospect ended the month on a high note.

      " PITTSBURGH — Milwaukee Brewers starter Jhoulys Chacin’s command failed him in the third inning Friday night. And it proved costly. \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the inning, three of them with the bases loaded during a 9-4 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. \n",
      " Chacin’s woes included a five-pitch walk to Pirates starter Chris Archer that pushed Pittsburgh’s lead to 5-1. Freddy Peralta replaced Chacin and Kevin Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh’s advantage to 7-1 and drop Chacin (3-7) to 1-7 in his past 10 starts. \n",
      " Chacin — a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series — saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2⅔ innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      " “I just lost my focus in that inning,” Chacin said. “That never happened to me before, walking guys with the bases loaded like that. I need to start to do a better job if I want to keep pitching.” \n",
      " Something that might not be guaranteed. Asked if Chacin might need a break, Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said only: “We’ve got to figure out how to get him pitching the way he’s capable of.” \n",
      " Slugger Josh Bell had two of Pittsburgh’s 13 hits — all singles. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. His 94 total bases during the month are the most by any Pirate in any month ever. Heady territory considering Pittsburgh started playing baseball a century — and then some — before Bell was born. \n",
      " “I feel like I’m just riding the wave,” Bell said. \n",
      " One that doesn’t appear close to cresting. \n",
      " Bell’s total base mark broke Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner’s record of 92 set in June, 1947. Bell is also one of only three players in NL history to have 12 home runs and 12 doubles in the same month, joining Hall of Famers Frank Robinson and Hank Aaron. \n",
      " × \n",
      " {{featured_button_text}} \n",
      " “He pushes himself,” Archer (2-5) said of Bell after picking up his first victory since April 7. “If he gets out, he’s mad. He’s hitting .340 and he’s angry that he’s got out, which continues to keep him motivated. He’s not content. We’ve got four months left in the season and I expect to see big things from him going forward.” \n",
      " Bell didn’t provide any big blasts Friday night, but contributed to a flood of small ones as the Pirates won for just the fourth time in 11 games. Starling Marte had three hits and scored three times and Newman went 2-for-5 with two RBIs to extend his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games. \n",
      " Archer had seven strikeouts with two walks in seven innings. He gave up a solo home run to Jesus Aguilar in the third and a three-run shot to Keston Hiura in the fourth but settled down afterward. \n",
      " “I’m going to stay relentless,” Archer said. “I’ve been doing this a long time. I’m not going to let (a slump) define me.” \n",

      " The Pirates’ Nick Kingham (1-1, 8.28) hasn’t won a game as a starter since last July. Kingham — who has bounced between the bullpen and the rotation this season — allowed three runs in 4⅔ innings against Cincinnati on Monday. \n",

      " LOS ANGELES (AP) — Baylor’s Shea Langeliers set an NCAA Baseball Tournament record with 11 runs batted in as the Bears defeated Omaha 24-6 on Saturday and eliminated the Mavericks from the Los Angeles Regional. \n",
      " The previous record was 10 RBIs, which was shared by Vanderbilt’s Connor Kaiser (2018) and Miami’s Kevin Brown (2001). The junior catcher went 5 for 6, including three home runs. More than half of his RBIs came in the sixth and seventh inning with a three-run double and three-run homer. \n",
      " Baylor scored a run in every inning but the eighth and had 23 hits, 13 of which went for extra bases. Josh Bissonette added four hits while Andy Thomas, Richard Cunningham and Nick Loftin had three apiece as 10 Baylor players got at least one hit. \n",

      " CHARLESTON, W.Va. — With where he hits in the lineup, Charleston Catholic’s Will Strickland knows he’ll often have a chance to drive teammates in. \n",
      " Strickland, the Irish’s No. 5 hitter, made the most of those chances in Saturday’s Class A semifinal against Wheeling Central. \n",
      " The Irish catcher broke a tie with a two-run double in the fourth inning, then cleared the bases with a triple in the sixth that allowed Charleston Catholic to top the Maroon Knights, 10-4, at Appalachian Power Park. \n",
      " “I can’t say enough about Will. That’s the 37th game he’s caught for us this season,” Charleston Catholic coach Bill Mehle said. “I talked to him over the winter about if you want to hit in the heart of the order, catch a lot of games and compete in the postseason, you better get in good shape because the legs are the first to go. You’re not going to be able to hit effectively as we get deeper into the season otherwise. \n",
      " “He took that advice and really worked on legs and his core over the winter.” \n",
      " The victory sends the second-seeded Irish (27-10) into Sunday’s Class A title game against No. 1 Moorefield. \n",
      " Charleston Catholic’s Bill Mehle interview \n",
      " After Wheeling Central (22-10) had tied the game at 4 with a pair of runs in the top of the fourth, Strickland put Charleston Catholic on top for good in the bottom of the inning with a two-out double that scored Marshall Pile and J.W. Armstrong. \n",
      " “I was just trying to get on and do the best for the team,” Strickland said. “At that point, give us the lead and give everyone else a chance to do what they do best.” \n",
      " Pile, the Irish’s starting pitcher, was forced to come off the mound in the fifth due to pitch count restrictions. He gave way to Thomas Blaydes, who retired all four batters he faced in the fifth and sixth innings. \n",
      " The Irish put the game out of reach with one Strickland swing in the home half of the sixth. A hit batsman combined with an error and walk allowed Charleston Catholic to load the bases with no outs, and Strickland belted a triple to left to score all three baserunners for a 9-4 lead. \n",
      " MetroNews Game Broadcast \n",
      " Evan Sayre’s sacrifice bunt scored courtesy runner Andrew Strickland for the game’s final run. \n",
      " Blaydes retired two of the three batters he faced in the seventh before coming off the mound with 29 pitches so that he can start against the Yellow Jackets. \n",
      " “I’m sure as hard-nosed a competitor as he is, he’ll be fully available and ready to go tomorrow,” Mehle said. \n",
      " The Maroon Knights got off to the start they were hoping for with pair of first-inning runs. Avery Lee led off with a triple and scored with no outs, before Sonny Peluchette singled to center to bring home Kyle Newmeyer. \n",
      " But the Irish wasted no time responding, plating a pair of runs in their half of the first to get even. Pile led off with a double and scored on a wild pitch, while Armstrong singled to score Parker Ross. \n",
      " “That’s a momentum buster when they come back and get two,” Central coach Bo McConnaughy said. \n",
      " Wheeling Central left a pair of runners in scoring position in the second and third innings, while Charleston Catholic stranded the bases loaded in the second. \n",
      " The Irish produced a pair of runs in the third for their first lead, scoring on a bunt from Sayre that led to a Maroon Knights’ error and Peluchette’s second balk of the inning, which brought home Andrew Strickland. \n",
      " “We preach make the routine plays, hit with men on base and good pitching,” McConnaughy said. “We didn’t get any of those today.” \n",
      " Central scored twice in the fourth, capitalizing on a hit batsman and Lee’s infield single. With Jacob Rine on third and Lee on second, Angelo Gentile sent a ground ball to short that resulted in an error and both runners scoring to tie the game at 4. \n",
      " But that was all the offense the Maroon Knights could muster, as Blaydes threw two scoreless innings in relief with three strikeouts. \n",
      " Pile picked up the win after allowing four runs in 4 2/3 innings. He struck out seven and walked a pair. \n",
      " Peluchette took the loss after allowing eight runs on 3 1/3 innings. He scattered three hits and issued six walks after coming on for Adam Murray, who allowed two runs  in 1 2/3 innings. \n",
      " Will Strickland finished 2-for-3 with five RBIs to lead all hitters. \n",
      " “It was pretty special,” Strickland said. “I can’t really think of a bigger moment, but we’ll see tomorrow.” \n",

      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",

      " Yankees No. 3 prospect strikes out six, gives up two hits \n",
      " Friday's start marked the second time this season Albert Abreu has walked two batters or fewer. (Michael Dill/Trenton Thunder) \n",
      " By Chris Bumbaca / MiLB.com | May 31, 2019 10:35 PM \n",
      " Feel good, pitch good. It sounds simple, but it's the truth for Albert Abreu. \n",
      " In his longest outing of the season, the Yankees' third-ranked prospect fired seven scoreless innings. He allowed two hits and two walks, striking out six, as Double-A Trenton blanked Harrisburg, 2-0, on Friday at Arm & Hammer Park. \n",
      " \"He's been getting after it,\" Thunder pitching coach Tim Norton said. \"He's been ready for the first pitch of every inning, not easing into it, just kind of getting after it right from the get-go. He settled in and got in a good rhythm.\" \n",
      " Video: Trenton's Abreu whiffs sixth \n",
      " Nationals No. 2 prospect Luis Garcia led off the game with a single to center field. From there, it was all Abreu (2-4). \n",
      " The native of the Dominican Republic didn't allow another hit until his final inning. After issuing a leadoff walk to Austin Davidson in the fourth, Abreu retired nine in a row. Nats No. 20 prospect Tres Barrera opened the seventh with a double off the wall in center, but the 23-year-old recorded three straight outs to strand Barrera at third and protect a 1-0 lead. \n",
      " Gameday box score \n",
      " Finding a way to pitch out of trouble in key spots is a vital step in his development. \n",
      " \"You're starting to see it coming out of him in big spots, making big pitches and limiting damage, which is huge,\" Norton said. \"Once in a while, you're going to have those big innings. He's getting closer and closer to consistently leave guys out there in big spots. He came off the mound fired up, and he should have been, tight game like that. It was huge.\" \n",
      " Abreu threw 55 of 84 pitches for strikes in his first scoreless start of the season. The two free passes were the fewest he's allowed since walking a pair against New Hampshire on April 24. In his previous two starts, the 6-foot-2 righty issued 10 free passes over 10 2/3 innings, including a six-walk outing on May 24 at Binghamton, where he surrendered a season-high six runs in five frames. \n",
      " \"He's put together a really good stretch the last six or seven games,\" Norton said. \"The last one was a dud, of course, with the walks and everything. But he's been in a great spot.\" \n",
      " Abreu has begun rounding into form this month. Prior to the Binghamton outing, he yielded five runs -- four earned -- over 24 2/3 innings in his previous four outings. \n",
      " Throwing the ball over the plate is always an emphasis, and Norton described Friday's performance \"a comeback start\" in that regard. \n",
      " \"Everything he has is good,\" the pitching coach said. \"He has a terrific arm, two plus off-speed pitches. They just need to show up more consistently, and they're starting to. He's not far away. It's just about being consistent. I know that's the everyday answer, but he has what it takes so that when he needs to make a pitch, he makes a pitch.\" \n",
      " Abreu lowered his ERA to 4.11 and has 43 strikeouts over 50 1/3 innings. On Friday, his 65-grade fastball reached 100 mph as late as the fourth inning and his curveball was particularly sharp. The uptick in velocity is something Norton has seen more of this season. His fastball sat typically in the mid-90s last year. \n",
      " \"He came to us with that [velocity],\" the pitching coach said. \"Like a lot of guys, it fluctuates over two to three years. \n",
      " \"I think his arm just feels better this year, and you're starting to see him sit at 97, 98 in some starts.\" \n",
      " Abreu's health also has improved. He had three separate stints on the injured list in 2018, when all but one of his non-rehab starts were with Class A Advanced Tampa. Certain pitchers, Norton said, pitch differently when their arm feels better. \n",
      " \"It might be for a few months, it might be for a year,\" he said. \"I think that's just kind of the life of a pitcher, where it just doesn't feel 100 percent for a pitcher. He's coming out of the gates every game getting after it, and it's coming out hot. I'm sure it feels a little better, overall.\" \n",

New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row.

Davis then hit a chopper toward the mound that bounced off Andriese's glove as he reached up. Marte could not handle the ball cleanly as the tying run scored. Gómez followed with a grounder inside the bag at third that drove in Hechavarría, but the ball boy stationed down the line — Arizona uses seniors dubbed \"Golden Glovers\" — fielded the ball thinking it was foul, and Davis was not permitted to score. \n",
      " Zack Wheeler (5-3) struck out nine in seven innings, and Robert Gsellman got three outs for his first save. \n",
      " Arizona lost its fifth straight game, matching a season high. Christian Walker and Ketel Marte homered for the Diamondbacks. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game lead in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 consecutive games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season set in 2006. \n",
      " Jose Berrios and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. \n",
      " Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three consecutive days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " Kolarek, a left-hander, relieved to face the left-handed hitting Rosario, and Rosario grounded an opposite-field single to left, past the spot vacated when third baseman Christian Arroyo shifted toward shortstop. \n",

      " Rays opener Ryne Stanek gave up one run in two innings. \n",
      " Astudillo had an RBI single in the first, but Kevin Kiermaier's two-run home run in the second put the Rays ahead. Austin Meadows stole home in the third when with runners at the corners and two outs, Willy Adames got caught in a rundown while Meadows dashed home. The throw from Schoop at second was in the dirt and got away from Astudillo at the plate. \n",

      " David Dahl had three hits as the Rockies won their seventh straight and improve to 8-1 on their homestand. Scott Oberg got the final out for his second save. \n",
      " Gray's scoreless outing overshadowed a strong start by Toronto's Marcus Stroman (3-7). The right-hander settled down after a rough first, giving up four runs, three earned, in seven innings. \n",
      " Stroman was able to keep an offense in check that had 18 hits in Friday's win over Toronto. \n",
      " \"I pitched seven innings against one of the best lineups in baseball, and I didn't see a single barreled ball to the outfield all game in seven innings,\" he said. \"All weak contact, all ground balls. Seven hits, six of them were ground balls. That's unbelievably hard to do against that lineup.\" \n",
      " Justin Smoak spoiled the Rockies' shutout bid with a solo homer leading off the ninth, and after a throwing error by shortstop Trevor Story, Danny Jansen hit an RBI double with two out to make it 4-2. Oberg got pinch-hitter Rowdy Tellez to ground out to end the game. \n",
      " Gray (5-4) worked out of trouble in the second and sixth innings before leaving in the seventh. He struck out the first two batters and followed that with two walks when a hot spot middle finger on his pitching hand. Manager Bud Black came out and after a discussion he was pulled. \n",
      " \"It really sucks, but it's part of the game,\" Gray said. \"There's always going to be some kind of adversity.\" \n",
      " Jairo Diaz came on in relief and got the final out. \n",
      " Colorado had a relatively quiet offensive night after getting 35 hits in its previous two games. It looked as if it would be another big night at the plate in the first inning when four straight hits off Stroman. \n",
      " Arenado followed singles by Story and Dahl with one of his own to drive in the first run, and Murphy made it 3-0 with a two-run double past center fielder Jonathan Davis. \n",
      " \"Getting that three-run lead early tonight was really nice,\" Gray said. \"I was able to sit back and pitch my game and not have to worry about, 'Hey, if I give up a solo here we're in trouble.' It was nice to be able to pitch like that.\" \n",
      " Stroman retired 19 of the last 23 batters he faced, and the only blemish came in the fifth when Colorado tacked on another run. \n",
      " Raimel Tapia extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a double, and two Toronto errors on the play allowed him to score to make it 4-0. \n",
      " \"Stroman did an outstanding job going seven,\" Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoya said. \"He kept us in the game until the end.\" \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Rockies: OF Charlie Blackmon (right calf strain) did some running in the outfield before Saturday's game and is on track to be activated from the 10-day injured list when Colorado starts its six-game road trip at the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday. \n",
      " FLASHING LEATHER \n",
      " Arenado showed why he has won six Gold Gloves when he ranged to his right to grab Jansen's grounder in the fifth and then side-armed a throw to Murphy at first as he was veering toward the Toronto dugout. \n",
      " Seeing Arenado make a great play has become normal for the Rockies. \n",
      " \"I knew it was going to happen when I saw him take off sideways,\" Gray said. \"The throw was on the money. I couldn't help but enjoy it.\" \n",
      " Not to be outdone, Dahl made a diving catch in right field to save a run in the sixth inning. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Toronto righty Aaron Sanchez (3-5, 3.75) will make the second start of his career at Coors Field. He won his only other outing in 2016, when he allowed one run in eight innings. He will go against Rockies right-hander Antonio Senzatela (3-4, 5.81). \n",

The 14-run win is the largest margin of victory in a regional opener since the Tigers opened the 2000 regional opener with a 19-1 win against Jackson State and is the fifth double-digit regional opening victory since 1996 (’97, ’98, ’00, ’08, ’19). \n",
      " LSU will meet Southern Miss at 6 p.m. CT Saturday in The Box. TV for the game is TBD, and fans can listen to the game on the LSU Sports Radio Network, including 98.1 FM in Baton Rouge. \n",
      " Freshman Landon Marceaux improved to 5-2 on the season after throwing only 53 pitches in five innings. He limited Stony Brook to two runs—one earned—on seven hits, walked one and struck out three. \n",
      " Ma’Khail Hilliard was the first Tiger out of the bullpen and he allowed one run on one hit and struck out two in the sixth. Trent Vietmeier made his first appearance back on the mound since May 10 at Arkansas. He, Chase Costello and Rye Gunter combined for the final three innings, blanking the Seawolves after allowing two hits and striking out three. \n",
      " Right-hander Greg Marino suffered the loss and fell to 5-5 after allowing seven runs—two earned—on three hits, walked three and struck out two in 1.1 innings. \n",
      " Stony Brook was first on the board in the top of the first inning. First baseman Chris Hamilton singled through the left side and moved to second on a wild pitch before scoring on an error by the shortstop. \n",
      " The Tigers erupted for five runs on two hits and one error in the bottom of the inning to make it a 5-1 game. With the bases loaded and two outs, first baseman Chris Reid drew a walk before catcher Saul Garza cleared the bases with a double down the right field line. Second baseman followed with a RBI single to center field to round out the five-run first inning. \n",
      " In the bottom of the second inning with shortstop Josh Smith on second base after a single and a stolen base, Duplantis slapped an RBI single up the middle. With runners in scoring position after a base hit by left fielder Daniel Cabrera, designated hitter Cade Beloso hit a sacrifice fly to left field to bring in Duplantis. Center fielder Zach Watson then hit a moon shot to left field for his sixth home run of the year, a two-run blast, to put the Tigers up 9-1. \n",

      " A former Polk County Public Schools bus attendant walked out of jail earlier this month after she was charged with abusing six special needs students. She was back in jail Wednesday after deputies said she was caught on film hitting two more students. \n",
      " Juanita Tappin, 43, of Lakeland, was already charged with three counts of child abuse and three counts of abusing disabled adults when Polk County Sheriff’s Special Victims Unit decided to watch 30 days of video from the special needs bus she worked on. Detectives charged her with child abuse and abuse of an disabled adult, according to the sheriff’s office. \n",
      " The students were riding the bus to Doris A. Sanders Learning Center, which is a school for disabled and special needs children and adults from ages five to 22 , the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Most of the students on the bus are non-verbal, so they could not easily communicate what happened. \n",
      " On May 7, a girl who rides the bus told school staff that Tappin hit her, and the school nurse found two red welts on her face, according to an affidavit. Detectives watched the video from the bus and saw Tappin hit, punch and snap a rubber band on six students — three children and three adults — within a two-hour span that morning. \n",

      " The video shows Tappin snapping the girl with a rubber band 11 times, hitting her in the face and neck, according to an affidavit. Tappin also snapped another child with the rubber band and hit a child on the head with a plastic seat belt cutter. Deputies said Tappin hit disabled adults with the rubber band in the face and punched one in the torso. \n",
      " The bus driver told detectives she never noticed Tappin abusing students because she was focused on driving. Tappin denied hitting anyone and told detectives she was acting in a “playful manner” before they arrested her on May 9, the affidavit said. She bonded out of jail on May 11 after paying $6,000. \n",
      " When detectives watched bus footage for the 30 days before May 7, they saw more incidents of Tappin abusing two previously identified students and hitting two other students, according to a press release. Tappin is accused of hitting an adult in the face with her hand and hitting a child on the head with a plastic water bottle and the metal end of a seat belt. \n",
      " The affidavit on her most recent arrest is not immediately available online. Tappin was suspended from Polk County Public Schools without pay on May 15 and will be fired during a June 18 school board meeting, a press release said. She remains in the Polk County Jail without bond. \n",

      " BALTIMORE (AP) — Former major leaguer Dwight Smith Sr. rose to his feet and emphatically pumped his fist as the ball cleared the center field fence. His son not only ignited the home crowd, he also paved the way for one of the biggest wins of the season for the Baltimore Orioles. \n",
      " Dwight Smith Jr.’s first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants 9-6 Friday night. \n",
      " “I feel like every time he is around I do something,” the younger Smith said. “He’s a good luck charm. He was acting like he was at a football game tonight. It was pretty funny to watch on the big screen.” \n",
      " The teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Nunez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home. \n",
      " Nunez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Jonathan Villar had two hits and scored twice. The Orioles second baseman is 13 for 39 (.333) with four doubles, two home runs and six RBIs in the last 11 games. \n",
      " “It’s been a rough couple of months,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. “We’ve had so many tough losses. For us to be able to come back and take a serious blow in the top of the first to stay with it and stay in the game and continue to take good at-bats and stay together in the dugout, I thought it was just awesome.” \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, who was traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " “A great day by the kid,” Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. “He’s done a nice job out in the outfield, swinging the bat. He got us going there in that first inning, then leads off with a home run to give us life again.” \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. Yastrzemski, Buster Posey and Steven Duggar had RBI singles and Brandon Crawford drove a run in with a sacrifice fly. \n",
      " The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith’s grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). \n",
      " Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",
      " After Yastrzemski tied the game 6-6 with a solo homer in the second, the Orioles regained the lead in the bottom half on a two-run homer by Mancini that ended the night for Pomeranz. \n",
      " The Giants left-hander tied a career-high by allowing eight runs on six hits. Pomeranz’s ERA rose from 6.45 to 8.08. \n",
      " Cashner didn’t allow another run after the first and lasted five innings, with a season-high 109 pitches. He allowed six runs and eight hits with five walks. \n",
      " “It was probably one of my worst starts of my career,” Cashner said. “I just kept telling myself to get through the fifth, try to save the bullpen as much as I can no matter how many runs you give up.” \n",
      " Nunez homered off Sam Dyson in the seventh inning to make the score 9-6. \n",
      " The Orioles’ bullpen took over, with Paul Fry and Mychal Givens combining for 2 1/3 scoreless innings before Richard Bleier got the last five outs and picked up his second save. \n",
      " MLB DRAFT \n",
      " The Orioles hold the first overall pick in this year’s Major League Baseball draft that begins Monday by virtue of their 47-115 record last season. Baltimore first-year general manager Mike Elias said the team has narrowed the potential No. 1 pick to four players. The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J. Abrams. “Nothing’s really changed. The draft is still three days away and we have a lot of time,” Elias said. ... The Giants have the 10th overall selection. \n",

      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",

      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",

      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",

      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",

      " CINCINNATI \n",
      " Tanner Roark's first career homer wasn't enough to get the win against his former Nationals teammates. Instead, it went to the other half of the first Tanner-for-Tanner trade in major league history. \n",
      " \"A weird day,\" Nationals starter Eric Fedde said. \n",
      " Except for the outcome. Nothing surprising about the Nationals winning in Cincinnati. \n",
      " Gerardo Parra hit a three-run homer that ended Roark's streak of keeping the ball in the park and Matt Adams added a solo shot Saturday, leading the Nationals to a 5-2 victory — their ninth in 10 games at Great American Ball Park. \n",

      " The Nationals faced Roark (4-4) for the first time since trading him to the Reds in the offseason for Tanner Rainey. Both pitchers came away with a career moment. \n",
      " Roark drove in a run with a squeeze bunt and connected for his first career homer off Fedde, his first in 336 career plate appearances. \n",
      " \"I felt like my emotions were under control,\" said Roark, who went six innings. \"It's definitely a tough loss. The bunt and the home run felt good. I would've rather have won the game.\" \n",
      " Two homers made the difference. \n",
      " Parra's homer in the second inning ended Roark's string of 36 2/3 innings without allowing a homer, the second longest of his career. Adams also connected in the fourth inning, leaving him 6 for 12 career against Roark with three homers. Brian Dozier homered in the ninth. \n",
      " Roark led the NL with 15 losses last season but has been part of the Reds' successful overhaul of their rotation. He gave up six hits and fanned six in six innings. \n",
      " Roark won 64 games for the Nationals from 2013-18 and was traded to Cincinnati in December for Rainey (1-1), who got into the game in the fifth. He acknowledged that he had extra motivation facing his former team, and he fanned three of the five batters he faced for his first major league win. \n",
      " \"For me getting the first win in here, it is special,\" Rainey said. \n",
      " Rainey fanned Yasiel Puig with a runner on third to end the fifth inning, and then struck out two more batters in the sixth. \n",
      " \"He's going to be a good one, he really is,\" manager Dave Martinez said. \"He has that look when he comes out of the bullpen that I really like,\" \n",
      " Sean Doolittle retired the side in order in the ninth for this 11th save in 13 chances. \n",
      " Washington's Juan Soto went 0 for 4, ending his career-best hitting streak at 14 games. It was the longest hitting streak by a player under age 21 since Manny Machado also hit in 14 straight games in 2013. \n",
      " DOMINATION \n",
      " The Nationals are 17-5 against the Reds since 2016. \n",
      " DOUBLE TROUBLE \n",
      " The Reds hit into double plays in the first, third and fifth innings, helping Fedde escape trouble. \n",
      " \"That's the best I could have hoped for,\" said Fedde, who gave up six hits and three walks in four-plus innings. \"That's when the ground ball really comes into play. That saved me today.\" \n",
      " STREAKS \n",
      " Washington's Anthony Rendon has reached base in 18 consecutive games, going 22 for 64 with six doubles, two triples, four homers and 16 walks. Cincinnati's Nick Senzel doubled, extending his streak to nine games, the longest by a Red this season. \n",

      " Written by By The Associated Press \n",
      " NEW YORK (AP) — DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",
      " Rafael Devers homered early for the third-place Red Sox, who fell 8½ games back in the division. That's the furthest they've been behind the Yankees since finishing the 2015 season nine games in the dust. \n",
      " PIRATES 9, BREWERS 4 \n",
      " PITTSBURGH (AP) — Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin. \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",
      " REDS 9, NATIONALS 3 \n",
      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",
      " Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto's 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. \n",
      " Cincinnati's Joey Votto returned after missing three games with a tight right hamstring and had three hits. Eugenio Suarez was back in the lineup after getting hit on the left hand by Clay Holmes' pitch on Wednesday. \n",
      " TWINS 5, RAYS 3 \n",
      " ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — Eddie Rosario hit a tiebreaking, two-run single off Adam Kolarek in the ninth inning after a pair of batters were hit by pitches, and Minnesota beat Tampa Bay in a matchup of two of the major leagues' hottest teams. \n",
      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth. Schoop was sacrificed to second and took third on a groundout, and Jorge Polanco was intentionally walked, and Castillo hit Willians Astudillo on the left arm with a slider on a 1-2 count. \n",
      " ROCKIES 13, BLUE JAYS 6 \n",
      " DENVER (AP) — Trevor Story hit a pair of two-run homers as part of a career-high seven-RBI night and the Colorado Rockies beat the slumping Toronto Blue Jays for their sixth straight win. \n",
      " It was the 13th career multi-homer game for Story, who also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. \n",
      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",
      " Edwin Jackson (0-3) tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. \n",
      " ORIOLES 9, GIANTS 5 \n",
      " BALTIMORE (AP) — Dwight Smith's first career grand slam capped a six-run outburst in the first inning and the Orioles outslugged the San Francisco Giants. \n",
      " Trey Mancini and Renato Núñez also homered for the Orioles, who overcame a five-run, first-inning deficit and improved to 8-21 at home as the teams met at Camden Yards for the first time since 2004. Núñez has homered in seven of his last 11 games and has a team-leading 14 homers this season. \n",
      " Mike Yastrzemski, traded by Baltimore on March 23 after he was reassigned to minor league camp, homered and tripled in his first two at-bats for San Francisco, which has lost eight of nine. \n",
      " The Giants charged to a 5-0 lead off Andrew Cashner (6-2) in the first inning. The Orioles countered with six runs, highlighted by Smith's grand slam, in the bottom half off Drew Pomeranz (1-6). Cashner and Pomeranz combined for 90 pitches in the opening inning. It was the first time that two teams scored at least five runs in the first inning since July 6, 2012, (Yankees and Red Sox), according to STATS LLC. \n",

      " Charlie Tilson hit a two-run double to get Chicago's offense rolling. Tilson, Yoán Moncada, Yonder Alonso and Yolmer Sánchez each had two hits. The win moved the White Sox into a second-place tie in the AL Central with Cleveland. \n",
      " The Indians committed four errors. Four of Chicago's six runs against slumping Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer were unearned. \n",
      " Covey (1-4) settled down after allowing a leadoff homer to Francisco Lindor and scattered eight hits and ended a personal six-game losing streak. Josh Osich and Juan Minaya followed with three innings of one-hit relief. \n",
      " Bauer (4-5) allowed nine hits and struck out eight in seven innings, but shaky fielding doomed the right-hander. \n",

      " Goodrum, who came into the night hitting just .208, launched a 419-foot drive that nearly went into the Chop House restaurant above the right-field seats in the third inning. He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",

      " The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage for May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). They went 8-18 in May 1980. \n",
      " Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter, and put four players on the right side of the infield. But Carpenter drove in Wong with a fly ball that found the grass in the left field corner. \n",

      " Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles, achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a dental procedure) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. \n",

But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A's their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. \n",

      " Defending national champion Oregon State was among the first teams eliminated from the NCAA Tournament on Saturday, marking the first time the Beavers have gone 0-2 in regionals in 14 appearances since 1985. \n",
      " The Beavers' 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton, which followed a 7-6 loss to American Athletic Conference champ Cincinnati on Friday, knocked them out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",
      " Baylor's Shea Langeliers turned in one of the greatest individual postseason performances, hitting three home runs and doubling while going 5 for 6 and driving in a tournament-record 11 runs in the Bears' 24-6 win over Omaha in an elimination game. \n",
      " \"It's a pretty cool,\" Langeliers said. \"It's a team accolade. I was up in the right situations and happened to come through.\" \n",
      " Langeliers' homers were for two, one and three runs. He also had a two-run single and three-run double. \n",
      " Illinois State sprung a surprise by beating No. 7 national seed Louisville 4-2 on the Cardinals' home field to move within one win of making its first super regional. \n",
      " No.  4 regional seeds Central Connecticut State, Jacksonville State and Ohio State won elimination games to stay alive. \n",

      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman's last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " Illinois State continued its surge under first-year coach Steve Holm, who took over a Redbirds team that went 22-30 a year ago and led them to a share of the Missouri Valley Conference title. \n",
      " Illinois State made the most of its three hits against Louisville starter Reid Detmers. Joe Aeilts doubled in a run in the first inning and Jeremy Gaines's two-run double in the sixth broke a 2-2 tie. Matt Walker scattered six hits, walked two and struck out seven in a complete game. \n",
      " The Redbirds will play Louisville or Indiana on Sunday night and would have to lose twice to be denied a berth in super regionals. \n",
      " ARMY'S STRUGGLES \n",
      " Army's offensive woes in the NCAA Tournament continued. Texas Tech had a no-hitter against Army into the sixth inning Friday, and Florida took a perfect game into the sixth Saturday. Army has gone two games-and-out in three of four regionals since reaching a final in 2009. The Black Knights have lost four straight tournament games by a combined score of 47-9. \n",

      " NEW YORK (AP) — DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4. New York has won nine of 11 overall and is 31-10 since a 6-9 start. \n",

      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",

      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts. \n",
      " REDS 9, NATIONALS 3 \n",
      " CINCINNATI (AP) — Curt Casali hit a three-run homer off Patrick Corbin, who had one of the worst starts of his career, and the Reds beat Washington to end the Nationals' streak of eight straight wins at Great American Ball Park. \n",
      " Corbin (5-3) gave up eight runs — one shy of his career high — in 2 2/3 innings. The Reds piled up 11 hits, matching the most the left-hander had allowed in a game. He retired only eight of his 20 batters. Corbin hadn't allowed so many runs since he also gave up eight on Sept. 8, 2017, during a 10-6 loss to San Diego. It's only the fifth time in his career that he has allowed eight or more runs. \n",
      " Reds right-hander Tyler Mahle (2-5) gave up three runs in five innings, including Juan Soto's 10th homer. Soto has hit safely in a career-high 14 straight games. \n",

      " Minnesota, a big league-best 38-18, overcame a 3-1 fifth-inning deficit and won for the 13th time in 16 games. The Twins opened a season-high 10½-game in the AL Central. They have scored three or more runs in 24 straight games, matching the Minnesota record for a single season, set in 2006. \n",
      " José Berríos and Taylor Rogers (2-1) combined on a four-hitter and stopped a six-game winning streak by the Rays (35-20), their longest since last August. Tampa Bay won the series opener 14-3 and had allowed three runs or fewer in its previous nine games. Helped by $7.11 tickets, the Rays drew 14,375 to Tropicana Field after three straight days of crowds ranging from 5,786 to 8,076. \n",
      " Diego Castillo (1-4) hit Jonathan Schoop on the left shoulder with a slider leading off the ninth.

      " Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. \n",

He hit another almost as far in the eighth for his second career multihomer game. Goodrum finished 5 for 5 to raise his average to .230. He scored four times and also collected a run-scoring single in a three-run fifth that blew the game open. \n",

But Josh Reddick started the comeback with a solo homer and Tony Kemp tied the game with a double. That set the stage for Fisher, who sent a drive out to center field against Lou Trivino (2-2) on the first pitch of the eighth to hand the A's their third straight loss following a 10-game winning streak. \n",

      " Antoine Duplantis: From Poster Child to Record Setter \n",
      " May       31, 2019, 10:39 PM (CT) Updated: May       31, 2019, 10:47 PM (CT) \n",
      " Cody Worsham \n",
      " Digital Media Reporter \n",
      " When Antoine Duplantis took the fourth pitch of his fourth at-bat on Friday night, he heard an unfamiliar sound from the Alex Box faithful. \n",
      " Boos. A bunch of ‘em. \n",
      " The fans wanted strikes. They did not want balls. They wanted to see Duplantis, who had already tied the LSU record for hits in a career with his 352nd two innings earlier, set the new mark. \n",
      " The next pitch was a strike, but Duplantis flew out. They’d have to settle with one historic moment, and a 17-3 victory over Stony Brook. \n",
      " Of all the clutch hits the Tigers put together on Friday, none were as important as Duplantis’ three, which leveled him with Eddy Furniss for the most among any to ever suit up for the school. \n",
      " Play stopped in the fifth, when he slapped hit No. 352 to left field and returned to first base to be greeted by a standing ovation. After LSU battled the final few weeks of the regular season to secure a home regional, Duplantis enjoyed the dividends. \n",
      " “It was great,” he said of the moment after tying the record. “I was fortunate enough to have a ton of people in the stands today, since it was a regional game at home. It was a special moment. I’m glad I had family, friends, teammates, and my coaches to be here to witness it.” \n",
      " Among those family was his brother, LSU track and field star Mondo, who knows a thing or two about setting records. The NCAA record-holder in pole-vaulting had lunch with his older brother Thursday, and he left the conversation confident Antoine would make history this weekend. \n",
      " Talked to Mondo Duplantis earlier today, who knows a thing or two about chasing records. Here’s what he had to say about Antoine Duplantis needing three hits this weekend to tie the @LSUbaseball record for career hits with 352. \n",
      " He just tied the record. pic.twitter.com/Vrxw3Q9LAQ \n",
      " — Cody Worsham (@CodyWorsham) June 1, 2019 \n",
      " “He seemed pretty chill about it,” Mondo said Friday, before the Stony Brook game. “If it was six or seven hits, it would be a little more tough, because he’d have to have a really good weekend. I think three hits is so much in the realm of possibility with him that it’s not going to be a big deal.” \n",
      " The hits came in typical Duplantis fashion, after a season that has been anything but typical for Twanie. His 11 home runs this season – after hitting just four career blasts in three prior seasons – have turned Duplantis into more of a pull hitter than in the past. Stony Brook feared his left-handed swing so much, they shifted the defense hard toward first base, with only the third baseman on the left side of the infield. \n",
      " After reaching on an error in his first at-bat, Duplantis pulled a single through the shift to right field, much to Paul Mainieri ’s fake chagrin. \n",
      " “The first hit I got today, I hit it in the hardest part to get a ball through the infield, and Coach Mainieri got on me and said I’m so hard-headed for not taking that hit in the six-hole (between a traditional shortstop and third base),” Duplantis said. “The next couple of at-bats, I had that in the back of my mind, so I was looking for a pitch I could push over there.” \n",
      " He got them, and he pushed them. Each of his last two hits might’ve been ground outs against a standard infield, but Duplantis shoved two singles to left field behind the defense, hearkening back to the days of old – before he was a bonafide slugger. \n",
      " Put it down in the record books, @antoine_dupl has tied Eddy Furniss with career hits ‼️ pic.twitter.com/S4hjNpIeEH \n",
      " — LSU Baseball (@LSUbaseball) June 1, 2019 \n",
      " “The reason he’s got 352 hits is because he uses the whole field,” Mainieri said. “He’s tough to pitch to. If you pitch him inside, he jerks it in the stands. If you pitch him away, he slaps it to left field. So I was really proud of him, to get a base hit to opposite field for the tying hit.” \n",
      " To Mainieri, Duplantis is more than an unprecedented hitter. He called him “the poster child” for LSU Baseball, a guy who “does everything the right way” on and off the field. \n",
      " “I’m not just proud of him because he’s got 352 hits,” Mainieri said. “He comes every day, he’s the same Antoine. He works hard in practice every day. He plays the games the same way, all out. He’s never been an ounce of trouble. He’s the opposite – he’s been the role model.” \n",
      " In typical Duplantis fashion, he’s just happy to have the pursuit behind him. Sure, there’s a new record to set at some point, if and when his next hit comes. But the team-over-self attitude he’s carried throughout his career hasn’t stopped now that he’s a record-holder. \n",
      " “It’s nice to get it out of the way,” he said. “At the same time, these last couple of days, I haven’t been thinking too much about it. Obviously, it’s in the back of my mind, but when I get in the box, I’m thinking about competing and getting the job done for the team.” \n",
      " Friday night, the job was done, in the form of those three hits, as well as three RBI. Duplantis led a clutch-hitting parade that saw LSU get six of its 10 hits with runners in scoring position. LSU will need that clutch hitting Saturday against Southern Miss in the marble game that will see the winner move on to the regional final and the loser fall into the loser’s bracket. \n",
      " With Duplantis in the lineup, there’s likely to be a few more clutch hits in the Tigers’ back pocket. One of them might even break a record. \n",
      " “I count myself as the lucky one to have seen every one of his hits,” Maineiri said. “Hopefully he’s got lots more in him.” \n",

      " The Minnesota Twins started the new month like they ended the last one. Winning, with home runs leading the way. \n",

      " Minnesota, which owns the best record in the majors at 39-18, has scored at least three runs in 25 straight games, setting a single-season franchise record. \n",
      " \"We expect a lot out of ourselves, so maybe we're a little ahead of where we thought we'd be,\" winner Kyle Gibson said. \"But I would say surprised probably isn't necessarily the right word. We had a pretty good feeling we were going to be pretty good.\" \n",

      " The Twins, who lead the majors with 108 homers, failed to go deep while splitting the first two games of the series at Tropicana Field. \n",
      " \"Their offense is leading all of baseball in many categories and there's a reason why ... they're balanced,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said. \"Hitting the ball out of ballpark at the rate they are and not striking out shows they've got some really quality hitters.\" \n",
      " Gibson (6-2) allowed one unearned run and six hits over five innings. \n",
      " Minnesota went up 2-1 on consecutive RBI doubles by Jorge Polanco and Gonzalez in the third off Yonny Chirinos (6-2). \n",

      " Miguel Sano had an RBI double during the seventh to complete a stretch where Minnesota scored in five consecutive innings. \n",
      " \"I think a strength of ours is the kinds of hitters that we have and the adjustments that our guys do make as they go around the lineup,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \n",
      " Travis d'Arnaud had a run-scoring single in the second for the Rays. \n",
      " Tampa Bay loaded the bases with two outs in the third but Gibson got a grounder from Christian Arroyo. \n",

      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Twins: DH Nelson Cruz, sidelined by a strained left wrist since May 14, is joining Class A Fort Myers for a short rehab stint. \n",
      " Rays: Backup C Michael Perez (strained right oblique) could start a rehab assignment Sunday with Class A Charlotte. ... INF Yandy Diaz (bruised left hand) homered in an extended spring training game and might be reinstated from the 10-day IL Sunday. \n",
      " ROSTER SHUFFLE \n",
      " With Tampa Bay starting outfielders Tommy Pham (right calf cramp) and Avisail Garcia (hamstring) out of the lineup for the second straight game, 1B Nate Lowe was recalled from Triple-A Durham and reliever Adam Kolarek was optioned to the International League club. \n",

      " Rays reliever Emilio Pagan said he has small bruise on the right cheek one day after having Jonathan Schoop's liner Friday night graze both a knuckle on the right hand and his face. Pagan was able to remain in the game. \n",

      " GRANVILLE, W.Va. – The record-breaking crowd that piled into the seats at Monongalia County Ballpark were on the edge of them most of the night. \n",
      " In the bottom of the third inning, when the West Virginia University baseball team showed its first sign of life as a long-awaited host, that same crowd shared the same urgency of the Mountaineers. They stood similar to the fans that crowded the fence high above the first-base line, the ones on the grass hillside beyond the Fordham dugout and those that settled for folding chairs overlooking the ballpark without having to pay for tickets. \n",
      " As their wildness grew, so did that of Fordham’s sophomore starting pitcher John Stankiewicz. \n",
      " Rattling the Atlantic 10 Conference Co-Pitcher of the Year, top-seeded West Virginia scored three runs in a raucous third inning and went on to defeat No. 4-seed Fordham, 6-2, in the Mountaineers’ first game as the host for the NCAA Baseball Regional in 64 years before 4,355 fans Friday night. \n",
      " “Great win,” West Virginia coach Randy Mazey said. “That’s a stadium full of energy tonight from the first pitch to the last. When you have that much energy in the stadium, you are exhausted when it’s over. I know I’m exhausted. I can’t imagine how these guys feel. That was a dogfight.” \n",
      " The win advances West Virginia (38-20) to a winners’ bracket game at 7 p.m. today against Duke, which defeated Texas A&M in the opener Friday afternoon, 8-5. Fordham (38-23) drops to an elimination game against the Aggies at 2 p.m. today. \n",
      " The danger of a leadoff single by West Virginia’s TJ Lake looked to be behind Stankiewicz after Lake was caught stealing for the first out in the third. That’s when the real problems began for the pitcher who began the year as a reliever. \n",
      " Stankiewicz walked No. 9 hitter Tevin Tucker. Tyler Doanes singled through the left side of the infield. One batter later, a wild pitch that handcuffed Rams catcher Justin Bardwell allowed Tucker to race from second all the way to home and tie the game at 1-1. The Mountaineers then took the lead when Doanes high-stepped across home plate on a deep sacrifice fly to right centerfield by Darius Hill. Walks to the next two batters, including a bases-loaded free pass to Ivan Gonzalez, gave West Virginia a 3-1 lead. \n",
      " “When (Brandon White) was up there with a full count, that’s as loud as I’ve ever heard this stadium,” Mazey said. “That’s not easy to pitch under those circumstances. I’ve been telling our fans the whole season, don’t just come and watch, come and help. I really think they helped us win that game because it’s not easy to throw a strike with 4,300 people yelling at you.” \n",
      " Stankiewicz was pulled before the inning ended, marking it his shortest outing since making his first collegiate start against North Florida on Feb. 24. \n",
      " “He doesn’t get rattled too much. I don’t think he was rattled,” Fordham coach Kevin Leighton said. “He has thrown a lot for us this year. I think a few calls didn’t go his way, at least from my angle. You are then working counts that are more hitter friendly. He just couldn’t command his offspeed stuff the way he normally has throughout the year and it got him in trouble. \n",
      " West Virginia extended its lead in the sixth and seventh inning with a pair of doubles. Doanes hit a sinking line drive to right centerfield to score a pair of runs to give the Mountaineers a 5-1 lead in the sixth. Gonzalez doubled to the game gap an inning later for another run. \n",
      " Playing in its first NCAA tournament in 21 years, Fordham got off to a fast start. The Rams opened the scoring when Matt Tarabek hit a run-scoring single under the diving glove of Doanes at second base to score Jake MacKenzie for a 1-0 lead. \n",
      " Fordham prevented an earlier Mountaineers’ rally with its defense in the second inning. Billy Godrick crashed into the final zero of the 400-foot sign in straightaway centerfield to rob Paul McIntosh of extra bases. Second baseman C.J. Vazquez made a leaping catch on a line-drive behind the second-base bag for another out and Stankewicz knocked down a line drive and threw onto first to end the inning. \n",
      " West Virginia pitcher Nick Snyder remained undefeated as a starter on the season. Snyder, who only pitched four innings in a relief role all of last season, is 9-0 in games he has started this year. He went five innings, gave up four hits, one run and struck out six, lowering his ERA to 2.65 in 68 innings. \n",
      " Duke 8, Texas A&M 5: \n",
      " Erikson Nichols and Rudy Maxwell each hit three-run home runs to power third-seeded Duke over No. 2-seed Texas A&M, 8-5, in the regional opener. \n",
      " Nichols broke a scoreless tie in the top of the fourth inning with a towering shot to left field to give the Blue Devils a 3-0 lead. Maxwell, who entered the game as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning, also sent the second pitch he saw well over the left-field wall. \n",
      " The two home runs for Duke (32-25) ignited a pair of four-run innings to support starting pitcher Ben Gross. \n",
      " Gross surrendered his lone run on a sacrifice fly by Texas A&M’s Braden Shewmake to left field in the fifth, cutting the Aggies’ deficit to 4-1. He scattered four hits and struck out five over seven innings to earn the win. \n",
      " The middle of Duke’s lineup caused problems for Aggies’ pitchers. The No. 4 through No. 7 hitters for the Blue Devils had 10 of their 11 hits. Kyle Gallagher and Nichols each had three hits. \n",
      " Texas A&M (37-22-1) scored four runs and sent the tying run to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning but its rally fell short. \n",

      " A Cincinnati team that entered the NCAA Tournament with barely a winning record pulled the biggest upset Friday, knocking off defending national champion Oregon State 7-6 on the Beavers’ home field. \n",
      " The Bearcats, who made the tourney by winning the American Athletic Conference Tournament and were just 30-29, were the only No. 4 regional seed to win on the first day of the tournament. \n",
      " No. 1 national seed UCLA got a strong 8 1/3 innings from Pac-12 pitcher of the year Ryan Garcia and beat tournament first-timer Omaha 5-2. \n",
      " Besides the one big upset, No. 3 regional seeds provided the biggest highlights. \n",
      " The lower seed won 12 of 15 matchups of second and third seeds, the best first round for No. 3s since the tournament went to its current format in 1999. \n",
      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU’s most lopsided in the program’s 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU’s club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles’ six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " “That was surreal. Didn’t expect that, honestly,” Becker said. “Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.” \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " “It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,” Martin said. “He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he’s a great teammate, he’s a tremendous young man. That’s how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.” \n",
      " WELL, THAT’S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska’s 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers’ pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE’S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",

      " One 2-3 matchup was suspended because of lightning in Greenville, North Carolina, with No. 3 Campbell leading North Carolina State 5-4 in the ninth inning. That game will be completed Saturday. \n",
      " Among the winning 3 seeds were the last four teams awarded at-large bids — Florida State, Michigan, Duke and TCU. \n",
      " FSU hit six homers in a 13-7 win over Florida Atlantic, Michigan beat Creighton 6-0 after Karl Kauffmann scattered six hits over 8 2/3 innings, and Duke beat Texas A&M 8-5 after Ben Gross turned in seven strong innings. \n",
      " TCU raised eyebrows with its 13-2 win over California after getting panned for its resume, which included a No. 59 RPI and a sub-.500 record in the Big 12. Hunter Wolfe and Johnny Rizer combined for six hits and seven RBIs for the Horned Frogs. \n",
      " Southern Mississippi had another notable win by a 3-seed, exploding for a 12-run fifth inning while defeating Arizona State 15-3. The 12-run loss was ASU's most lopsided in the program's 248 NCAA Tournament games and only the third by double digits. \n",
      " Last year, No. 3 regional seeds went 7-9 in the first round. \n",
      " CONFERENCE CALL \n",
      " ACC teams went 7-1 to lead the power conferences. The others: SEC, 7-3; Big 12, 4-1; Pac-12, 2-3; Big Ten, 2-3. \n",
      " WHO IS THIS GUY? \n",
      " Florida State got a jolt from an unlikely source. \n",
      " Tim Becker, a graduate student who played three seasons on FSU's club team before earning a spot on the varsity at an open tryout last fall, hit two of the Seminoles' six homers and drove in four runs to match his previous season total. He entered the game 8 for 32 for the season with no homers. He drew his fifth start in left field. \n",
      " \"That was surreal. Didn't expect that, honestly,\" Becker said. \"Got to be ready when you get put into a big situation, and I did that today.\" \n",
      " Coach Mike Martin said Becker did everything right to merit his shot. \n",
      " \"It just goes to show you that all most of us want in life is an opportunity to show what we can do,\" Martin said. \"He kept getting better and all of a sudden I realized he's a great teammate, he's a tremendous young man. That's how he got his opportunity to make the travel squad. Then he gets an opportunity to play.\" \n",
      " WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO DO IT \n",
      " Nebraska's 8-5 win over Connecticut might have been the most unconventional of the day. The Cornhuskers' pitchers allowed 19 hits and their batters struck out 16 times. \n",
      " HERE'S ANOTHER WAY \n",
      " After a three-hour rain delay in the bottom of the ninth, North Carolina won 7-6 over UNCW when Danny Serretti got caught in a rundown between third and home and scored when third baseman Cole Weiss overthrew the catcher. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",
      " — Oregon State's Adley Rutschman, batting .420 and the likely No. 1 pick in next week's Major League Baseball draft, was intentionally walked with the bases loaded to pull the Beavers within 5-3 in the seventh inning. \n",

      " Gallo´s grand slam sends Rangers past Royals \n",
      " e-mail \n",
      " Joey Gallo's first career grand slam highlighted a six-run sixth inning and helped the Texas Rangers even their scheduled four-game set against the visiting Kansas City Royals with a 6-2 victory on Friday night at Arlington, Texas. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2, 2.43 ERA) delivered a second straight strong start, giving up two runs and striking out six in six innings for the Rangers, who bounced back from Thursday's 4-2 loss to the Royals. However, it was Gallo's 16th homer of the season and first in seven games that was the difference. \n",
      " Texas was stymied for five innings by Kansas City's Danny Duffy (3-2, 4.05 ERA) until the home side broke through in a major way while batting around in the sixth. With Texas trailing 2-0, Elvis Andrus delivered an RBI single to cut the deficit in half, and the Rangers tied the score when Nomar Mazara drew a bases-loaded walk. Gallo, the next batter, crushed a 1-1 pitch just to the right of straightaway center field to break the tie and chase Duffy with one out in the inning. \n",
      " The home run by Gallo is just the third hit in 22 at-bats over his last seven games. However, it proved to be more than enough to send the Rangers to their third victory in four games after losing three in a row. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, Chris Martin and Shawn Kelley each pitched a scoreless inning of relief for Texas, which has won 20 of the last 25 meetings against Kansas City. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert, called up by the Royals from Triple-A Omaha this week, homered in his first at-bat of 2019, a solo shot in the second inning. Alex Gordon came through with an RBI triple in the fifth for the Royals, who have lost seven of the last nine. \n",
      " Kansas City's Whit Merrifield had two hits, and is 7-for-17 in the last four games. \n",

      " Sheldon Irish capture Class 6A state softball championship \n",
      "  \n",
      " Saturday \n",
      " Jun 1, 2019 at 1:36 PM Jun 1, 2019 at 8:27 PM \n",
      " A sixth-inning rally, a seventh-inning survival and one historic celebration is how Sheldon softball ended its season. \n",
      " Emma Neuman capped a four-run sixth with a two-out, three-run double and then the Irish held on through a tense seventh to beat Tualatin 5-4 in the OSAA Class 6A championship game at Jane Sanders Stadium on Saturday, winning the program’s first state title. \n",
      " “At the beginning of the season we had a thought that we could go all the way but it wasn’t really a reality until today and I’m not even really sure what to say,” Sheldon pitcher Camille Leach said. “I’m so excited for our team, we’ve worked so hard.” \n",
      " It certainly took a full-game effort from the Irish (25-6) against the Timberwolves (25-6), who led 3-1 after five innings as Sheldon struggled to build momentum on offense against pitcher Tia Ridings. \n",
      " That all changed in the sixth. \n",
      " Jordan Henderson led off with her third hit of the game, beating out a slow grounder to third base. One out later Olivia Schmidt dropped a pop up into shallow right field to set up an RBI single from Ella Swangard, as Henderson hustled home from second base to beat the throw from center field, making it 3-2. \n",
      " After Ridings got her second strikeout of the inning, freshman Tori Leyba, Sheldon’s No. 9 hitter, came to the plate with a chance to keep the inning alive for Neuman. \n",
      " Leyba fouled off a couple of pitches as she worked the count full, then fouled off another pitch before drawing a walk to load the bases. \n",
      " “She’s been in that situation before and come through for us,” Sheldon coach Mike Faulconer said. “Over and over again Tori has done a great job getting good at-bats in order to set up the top of the order and give Emma a base runner.” \n",
      " Neuman, the Southwest Conference co-player of the year and the Irish’s top power hitter, watched Leyba’s at-bat from the on-deck circle desperate for a chance to play the hero. \n",
      " “I was hoping that Tori was going to get on, obviously,’” said Neuman, who was 0-for-2 in the game at that point. “I was like ‘If I get up there, I need to make something happen'.” \n",
      " It took her just one pitch to do so, as she ripped the first offering from Ridings to deep right center, emptying the bases and putting Sheldon up 5-3. \n",
      " “I really wanted my pitch, something I thought I could hit well and not pop up like I had the previous two at-bats,” Neuman said. “I wanted something I thought I could get into the green.” \n",
      " With her teammates going crazy in the dugout and the large pro-Sheldon crowd erupting in the stands, Neuman stood at second base and soaked in the moment. \n",
      " “I was like ‘Oh my gosh, I just did that!’” the senior catcher said. \n",
      " But the game wasn’t over, as the Irish needed Leach to buckle down for one more inning. \n",
      " The junior gave up a two-run home run in the first inning and then a two-out RBI single in the second as the Timberwolves built their early lead. \n",
      " Leach found her groove in the third and, after allowing a leadoff single that inning, sat down 10 straight until a one-out walk in the seventh. \n",
      " Ridings followed that free pass with a run-scoring double to center field as Tualatin cut its deficit to a single run. \n",
      " Ridings moved to third on a groundout by Andrea Gomez, and the Irish intentionally walked Emily Johansen — whose first-inning bomb gave Tualatin a 2-0 lead — to put the tying and go-ahead runs on base for clean-up hitter Leanna Rosenbaum. \n",
      " “It was very stressful,” Leach said. “I just knew I had to have full confidence in the team behind me. I know Tualatin is a great-hitting team so regardless what happened I had to have confidence in my team on the field.” \n",
      " It took just four pitches for Leach to get Rosenbaum to pop out to right field, sealing the victory for the Irish and setting off a celebration in the circle. \n",
      " “I just wanted her to calm down,” Neuman said of Leach going into the seventh, “and I wanted everyone to stay with us for three more outs.” \n",
      " Leach allowed seven hits to go with three walks and four strikeouts, with her ability to successfully navigate the top of Tualatin’s order in the seventh as impressive as anything she did in her previous six innings. \n",
      " Ridings allowed nine hits in six innings with three strikeouts and two walks for the defending state champions. She also went 3-for-4 with two RBIs and a run. \n",
      " “Five years ago this seemed like an impossible dream,” said Faulconer, whose first team in 2015 won just four games. “But every year we’ve gotten better and the girls work hard. We’ve got a great, great group of girls on this squad. I couldn’t be prouder of them.” \n",

Marley Sargent and Lorena Vasquez each drove in two runs for Ridgeview. Allicitie Frost struck out 15 Dragons (23-6) and allowed five hits in going the distance in the circle.

      " Back to Gallery \n",
      " BLOOMINGTON — In a heavyweight bout between state-ranked teams, Edwardsville’s Drake Westcott delivered the two biggest blows and it knocked out Normal West’s season. \n",
      " Westcott hit a grand slam in the second inning and added a two-run shot in the sixth inning for good measure to send the state’s second-ranked Tigers to a 12-8 victory over the 12th-ranked Wildcats at Horenberger Field in the championship game of the Class 4A Illinois Wesleyan Sectional. \n",
      " “Each time they were able to put up runs we were able to battle right back. This was a hard-fought win,” said Westcott, who finished 2 for 3 with the two homers and six RBIs. \n",
      " It is the second sectional championship in three seasons for EHS, which defeated Normal West 7-0 in 2017’s sectional title game. It is the state-record 18th sectional championship for the Edwardsville program. \n",
      " “It’s all about winning and advancing. This wasn’t the prettiest game. It was a knockdown, drag-out battle,” Tigers coach Tim Funkhouser said. \n",
      " Winners of seven straight, Edwardsville (34-5) plays seventh-ranked Chicago Marist (27-10) at 6 p.m. Monday in the Springfield Lincoln Land Community College Super-Sectional. \n",
      " Marist won the Lockport Sectional with a 9-5 victory over Providence Catholic. \n",
      " Normal West ends its season at 30-7, a win shy of its first sectional championship since 2005. \n",
      " The Wildcats have lost in three straight sectional championship games. \n",
      " “Both teams delivered punches. It was a heavyweight bout for a while. Tim has a great program over there and I have the ultimate respect for him,” Normal West coach Chris Hawkins said. \n",
      " Saturday’s game featured 20 runs, 20 hits and 10 walks. \n",
      " The two biggest hits belonged to Westcott, who entered Saturday’s game hitting .370 with six home runs and 31 RBIs. \n",
      " After Edwardsville rallied from a two-run deficit to take a 3-2 lead with a two-run double from Joe Copeland in the first and an RBI double from Logan Cromer in the second, Westcott walked to the plate with the bases loaded with one out in the second. \n",
      " “I don’t know if it takes guts or intelligence or nerve to walk him with the bases loaded, but it has always crossed my mind. Everybody says don’t pitch to Westcott. With the bases loaded, that’s tough to do,” Hawkins said. “When it comes down to it, we’re 30-6 for a reason and I’ll go down with the ship because we’re going to fight and claw.” \n",
      " On a 1-1 pitch, Westcott lined a grand slam over the 365-foot sign in right center to put the Tigers ahead 7-2. \n",
      " It was the second grand slam of Westcott’s career. He hit a walk-off slam against Granite City on March 28, 2018. \n",
      " “I got a pitch on the outside half of the plate — it was a fastball - and I hit it a long way,” Westcott said. “That was a huge momentum shift for the team.” \n",
      " After rallying for its previous two wins, Normal West didn’t go away. \n",
      " The Wildcats pulled to within 7-6 after scoring two runs in the third and fourth innings. \n",
      " In the bottom of the fourth, Edwardsville plated three runs on an RBI single from Copeland and a two-run single from Dalton Wallace, who battled back from an 0-2 count with two outs, for the 10-6 lead. \n",
      " “We had contributors throughout the way,” Funkhouser said. “This was a great team effort.” \n",
      " Normal West scored two more runs in the fifth, but couldn’t get any closer as reliever Collin Salter shut the Wildcats down in the sixth. \n",
      " Westcott delivered the nail in the coffin with a two-run home run to deep right field for the 12-8 lead. \n",
      " “It was a hanging curveball on the inner-half and I put a good swing on it and hit it a long way. Once we got that, you could kind of tell that they were down,” Westcott said. \n",
      " Finishing with six RBIs, Westcott tied a career high. It was his second multi-homer game of the season. \n",
      " “He put a good swing on a couple of pitches and we were able to get rewarded. That was a big punch we needed,” Funkhouser said. \n",
      " Salter finished off the win in the seventh, getting a double play to end it. \n",
      " After watching Normal West score eight runs on seven hits off starting pitcher Grant Schaefer and reliever Dawson Taylor, Salter threw two scoreless innings with two hits allowed. \n",
      " “They’re a good hitting team. If you leave the ball up, they are going to hit it. I had to keep the ball down. I was just doing my job and going out there and trying to close out the game,” Salter said. \n",
      " It was Salter’s third save of the season. \n",
      " Schaefer earned the win. He allowed six runs (four earned) on five hits with four strikeouts and four walks in 3.1 innings. His defense made two errors behind him, leading to the two first-inning runs. \n",
      " “Grant pitched better than what showed. Our defense was giving them more outs. He probably threw six innings worth of outs,” Funkhouser said. \n",
      " The Tigers banged out 11 hits, including five for extra bases. \n",
      " Copeland was 2 for 4 with three RBIs, while Burris, Wallace and Westcott added two hits apiece. \n",
      " The top of the order — Hayden Moore, Burris and Westcott — combined to score nine of the team’s 12 runs. They went 5 for 8 with two homers and a double. \n",
      " Austin Collinson had three hits and Sean Shook added two hits and two RBIs for the Wildcats. \n",

      " Mitchell Gold piles on runs in weather-shortened doubleheader \n",
      " By Daily Republic Sports on May 31, 2019  at 9:53 p.m. \n",
      " WATERTOWN—Mitchell Gold didn't lack any run production during Friday's doubleheader against the Watertown Red Sox. \n",
      " Mitchell totaled 21 runs in 21-9 win over Watertown in Game 1 and then added four more in Game 2. The second game was called in the middle of the third inning due to lightning with the score tied 4-4. \n",
      " Mitchell's 21-run game was highlighted by eight-run innings in the second and seventh as it racked up 12 hits as a team. \n",
      " Brock Sparks and Mason Geraets both had three hits and two RBIs, while Jace Larson and Seth Muth both added a pair of hits. Muth, Brandon Sparks and Landon Waddell all recorded two RBIs. Anders Enga drove in three runs, too. \n",
      " On the mound, Muth earned the win as he allowed nine earned runs on 17 hits in his six-inning start. Brock Sparks threw a scoreless seventh inning for Mitchell. \n",
      " Watertown jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the first inning after recording all four runs with two outs, but Mitchell responded with four runs in the top of the second thanks to a two-run single by Geraets, an error and a wild pitch that plated Grant London. \n",
      " Ethan Price tossed both innings without allowing an earned run on two hits, while striking out three and walking four. \n",
      " Mitchell (2-1-1) hosts Watertown in a doubleheader on Wednesday. \n",

      " Pittsburgh Pirates win 9-4 Friday night. \n",

      " PITTSBURGH (AP) - Josh Bell finished off his historic May with two more hits, Starling Marte added three hits and scored three times and the Pittsburgh Pirates pounced on struggling Milwaukee starter Jhoulys Chacin in a 9-4 victory Friday night. \n",
      "  \n",
      " Bell went 2 for 5 and drove in a run in front of a crowd that included fans in the right-field seats wearing \"Bellieve\" T-shirts as part of a promotion that doubled as an All-Star Game push for the 26-year-old first baseman. Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",
      "  \n",
      " Kevin Newman extended his hitting streak to a career-best 10 games with a pair of hits, including a two-run single off reliever Freddy Peralta in the third to cap a six-run outburst that put the Pirates firmly in control. \n",
      "  \n",
      " Chris Archer (2-5) gave up early home runs to Jesus Aguilar and Keston Hiura, but settled down to work seven innings and pick up his first victory since April 7. Archer struck out seven and walked two while needed only 92 pitches to get 21 outs as the injury-ravaged Pirates won for only the third time in their last 11 games. \n",
      "  \n",
      " Chacin (3-7) fell to 1-7 in his last 10 starts when his command briefly abandoned him in the third inning. \n",
      "  \n",
      " The 11-year-veteran walked four batters in the frame, three of them with the bases loaded, including a five-pitch walk to Archer that pushed Pittsburgh's lead to 5-1. Peralta replaced Chacin and Newman delivered a liner to left field that allowed Colin Moran and Adam Frazier to score and push Pittsburgh's advantage to 7-1. \n",
      "  \n",
      " Chacin - a 15-game winner last season for a team that reached the National League Championship Series - saw his ERA balloon to 5.74 after being charged with seven runs in 2 2/3 innings, with two strikeouts. His four walks marked a season high and he threw just 40 of his 76 pitches for strikes. \n",
      "  \n",
      " Aguilar hit his first home run in a month when he took Archer to the bushes beyond the center-field wall in leading off the third. Hiura pushed Milwaukee's home run total to 98 - tops in the National League - with a three-run shot to center in fourth. \n",
      "  \n",
      " Hiura had three of Milwaukee's six hits, but the second baseman was also charged with two of the Brewers' three errors on a funky play in the seventh when a liner by Jacob Stallings deflected off Peralta's glove to Hiura, who couldn't corral it initially, then threw into the Milwaukee dugout when he rushed his throw in an effort to get Stallings. \n",
      "  \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      "  \n",
      " Brewers: C Manny Pina (right hamstring discomfort) is expected to rejoin Milwaukee over the weekend. Pina is hitting .300 (3 for 10) during a rehab stint with Class A Wisconsin entering Friday. \n",
      "  \n",
      " Pirates: RHP Jordan Lyles (left hamstring discomfort) will start Sunday's series finale. Lyles exited a loss to Cincinnati last Tuesday after tweaking the hamstring in the fourth inning. ... RHP Keone Kela will be shut down for 10 days after the right shoulder discomfort that sent him to the injured list popped back up during a rehab assignment. \n",
      "  \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      "  \n",
      " Brewers: Brandon Woodruff (7-1, 3.22 ERA) will look for his seventh straight win on Saturday. Woodruff entered the season with five career victories spread across 2017 and 2018. He limited the Phillies to one run in eight innings last Sunday. \n",
      "  \n",
      " Pirates: Nick Kingham (1-1, 8.28) hasn't won a game as a starter since last July, but will get the nod on Saturday. Kingham - who has bounced between the bullpen and the rotation this season - allowed three runs in 4 2/3 innings against Cincinnati on Monday. \n",

      " The second day of NCAA regionals brought an early exit for the defending national champion, one of the greatest individual performances in tournament history and an upset that put upstart Illinois State a win away from its first super regional. \n",
      " Oregon State was eliminated on its home field with a 4-1 loss to Big East champion Creighton, marking the first time the Beavers have gone 0-2 in regionals in 14 appearances since 1985. They were knocked out in the regional round for the first time since 2015. \n",
      " \"It was a matter of us not playing good baseball. That's the bottom line,\" OSU interim coach Pat Bailey said. \n",
      " The Beavers lost 10 of their last 15 games and finished 36-20-1 a season after they completed a two-year run in which it won 111 of 130 games under former coach Pat Casey. \n",
      " The game was catcher Adley Rutschman's last for Oregon State. Rutschman is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the Major League Baseball draft on Monday. He was on deck when the Bluejays turned the game-ending double play. He had driven a ball to the warning track in his last at-bat and tipped his cap to the crowd as he jogged back to the dugout. \n",
      " In Los Angeles, Baylor's Shea Langeliers hit three home runs and doubled while going 5 for 6 and driving in a tournament-record 11 runs in a 24-6 win over Omaha in an elimination game. \n",
      " \"When I was a little kid, I liked to think I was a pretty good hitter, but I think this game will probably be one of the most meaningful games for me as a hitter probably for the rest of my career,\" Langeliers said. \"Our backs were up against the wall and we needed a big game from our offense and we got it. It was a lot of fun.\" \n",
      " Langeliers, who likely will be the second catcher drafted behind Rutschman, broke the NCAA postseason record of 10 RBIs in a game shared by Vanderbilt's Connor Kaiser (2018) and Miami's Kevin Brown (2001). \n",
      " Langeliers' homers were for two, one and three runs. He also had a two-run single and three-run double. \n",
      " Illinois State sprung a surprise by beating No. 7 national seed Louisville 4-2 on the Cardinals' home field to move within one win of making its first super regional. \n",
      " The Redbirds (36-24) continued their surge under first-year coach Steve Holm, who took over a team that went 22-30 a year ago and led them to a share of the Missouri Valley Conference title. \n",
      " Other national seeds that lost and face elimination Sunday: No. 3 Georgia Tech, No. 4 Georgia, No. 10 East Carolina and No. 15 West Virginia. \n",
      " HE DID IT AGAIN \n",
      " Down to his last strike with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Steven Williams hit a three-run homer to give Auburn a 6-5 walk-off win over Georgia Tech. Williams, the Tigers' 8-hole hitter, homered and drove in five runs Friday against Coastal Carolina. \n",
      " HE DID IT AGAIN, TOO \n",
      " Florida State's Tim Becker, the graduate student who walked on after playing three seasons on the school's club team, homered for the third time in two games in a 12-3 win over Georgia. \n",
      " FSU is a win away from super regionals in Mike Martin's 40th and final season. The Seminoles, a No. 3 regional seed for the first time under Martin and one of the last four teams selected for the tournament, have scored 25 runs in two games. \n",
      " THAT'S QUINNIPIAC, MAC \n",
      " No. 4 regional seed Quinnipiac upset East Carolina 5-4 in a first-round game postponed until Saturday. The Bobcats of Hamden, Connecticut, play third-seeded Campbell in a winners' bracket game Sunday. Quinnipiac went 0-2 in its only previous tournament appearance in 2005. \n",
      " BIG BATS \n",
      " - Bobby Morgensen hit two homers for the second straight day, leading Florida Atlantic in a 10-6 win over Mercer. \n",
      " - Hunter Coleman homered twice and drove in five runs in Texas A&M's 11-2 win over Fordham. \n",
      " - Dave Matthews' tie-breaking three-run homer in the third inning sent Central Connecticut State past California 7-4. \n",

The consensus top prospects are Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman, Texas high school shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., Cal first baseman Andrew Vaughn and Georgia high school shortstop C.J.

      " ATLANTA — Steven Williams and the blue-and-orange-clad Auburn fans seated along the third-base side of Russ Chandler Stadium behind him leaned to their collective left, perhaps trying to will his hard-hit ball inside the right-field foul pole for a home run. \n",
      " Their efforts were in vain. The ball drifted foul, and the sophomore right fielder struck out swinging on the next pitch. But something good can come from hitting a ball that hard. \n",
      " It did for Williams. His next time up, he skied a three-run home run so high to right field that it seemed to rise above the Atlanta skyline situated beyond the midtown stadium. He singled in each of his final three at-bats, once to center, one to left-center and one to left. \n",
      " The sophomore finished 4 for 5 with five RBIs and two runs scored. Add that to his totals from last year's sweep of an NCAA Regional in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Williams is 12 for 18 with two home runs, 10 RBIs and nine runs scored in four career first-round games. \n",
      " \"If we could repeat what we did last year in a Regional, I would be OK with that,\" Williams said. \n",
      " Auburn is off to a good start. The No. 2 seed bludgeoned No. 3 seed Coastal Carolina, 16-7. For the third straight year, the Tigers started the NCAA Tournament with a victory. They'll face the winner of Friday's nightcap between No. 3 national seed Georgia Tech and Florida A&M at 6 p.m. Central on Saturday. Right-hander Tanner Burns will get the start on the mound. \n",
      " “I think the potential has been there the whole time, the whole year. It has taken a little bit of time for us to figure some things out. We’ve had some ups and downs, but this game was really big for us and getting our momentum going,” Williams said. \"If we can carry that momentum into tomorrow and the rest of the Regional, I think we’ll be set up pretty well.” \n",
      " It didn't look like that would be the outcome Friday, not after starting pitcher Jack Owen needed 86 pitches to get through 3 2/3 innings before leaving in favor of Elliott Anderson. The score was 2-2 at the time, but if you had to guess which offense would blow the game open first, you would have guessed Coastal Carolina. \n",
      " The Chanticleers totaled 72 runs on 76 hits over a current five-game winning streak that ended with a Sun Belt Championship Tournament trophy. The Tigers had scored only 15 runs on 30 hits over their previous five games, losing four. \n",
      " But, like Williams, maybe Auburn just likes this particular time of year. It scored 40 runs in that three-game sweep of the Raleigh Regional last season and is already more than a third of the way to that total. \n",
      " Rankin Woley untied the game with an RBI single in the bottom of the fourth inning and Williams hit his home run on the very next pitch, and that was only the start of the onslaught. \n",
      " \"To see him get going, it really fired up the whole lineup and set the tone for the whole day,\" freshman second baseman Ryan Bliss said. \n",
      " Will Holland hit a two-run single. Matt Scheffler and Russellville grad Judd Ward - who was 3 for 5 Friday - hit RBI singles. Woley and Bliss hit two each. Conor Davis drilled a solo home run to the left of the center-field batter's eye. It marks the first time since a 17-7 win over Alabama on May 5 that the Tigers recorded more than 11 hits or eight runs in a single game. \n",
      " The 16 runs runs are the most Auburn has scored in an NCAA Regional game since 2010, as well as the team's total over its previous six games combined. \n",
      " \"Probably our best offensive baseball game of the season,\" coach Butch Thompson said. \n",
      " Williams was an unlikely hero. He has followed up a Freshman All-SEC campaign where he hit .291 with 12 home runs and 51 RBIs with a disappointing sophomore season, entering Friday's game with a .227 batting average, six home runs and 23 RBIs. The first and last of those totals ranked last among the team's regulars. \n",
      " In fact, the last time Auburn took the field in the SEC Tournament last Thursday against LSU, Thompson replaced him in the starting lineup with true freshman Devin Warner, who has made only 16 plate appearances this season. The coach gave some consideration to using him again Friday. \n",
      " \"In all honesty, we evaluated all week,\" Thompson said. \"Steven had had a really good week and had shown a lot of energy and kind of hung in there. I do want that to be a strength of our program, that we hang with our guys. I think they know that. Steven was given an opportunity today. We did not forget what he’s done in the postseason in the past. He rewarded us for that.\" \n",
      " He did. The only thing that went wrong for him Friday was Zach Beiermann's three-run home run in the seventh inning, which the right fielder appeared to have in his glove before it fell off his hand and landed on the other side of the wall. That made it a four-run game. \n",
      " No matter: Auburn scored seven more runs over the next two frames. Williams drove in one and scored another. \n",
      " \"This was like a new start to my season,\" he said. \"What happened in the regular season happened. This is a new season for me and for all of us. We just came out with a fresh mind and wanted to have fun and play the game.” \n",

      " Gallo broke a scoreless tie in the fourth inning, hitting a 1-0 pitch from Homer Bailey (4-6) over the home bullpen in right-center for his 17th homer of the season, good enough for a tie with four others for the American League lead. On Friday night, Gallo hit a grand slam in the sixth inning in a 6-2 win over the Royals. \n",
      " Bailey gave up four runs on six hits and two walks in 3 2/3 innings for his fourth straight start without a victory. He allowed only a first-inning single to Nomar Mazara before Hunter Pence led off the fourth with an opposite-field ground single to right ahead of Gallo's homer. \n",
      " The Royals have lost five of their last six games and have the worst road record in the majors at 8-22. Kansas City left seven runners on base and was 2 for 11 with runners in scoring position. \n",
      " Martin Maldonado and Cam Gallagher, who replaced Maldonado behind the plate in the sixth inning, had RBI doubles. Maldonado was pulled as a precaution with right forearm tightness. \n",

      " SHORT HOPS \n",
      " Rangers C Jeff Mathis had a sacrifice fly for his third RBI of the season in 31 games, his first since April 24. ... Five of Texas' six hits off Bailey were by left-handed hitters. The 33-year-old right-hander entered the game holding left-handed batters to a .213 batting average. ...  Merrifield has hits in 10 of his last 11 games. ... Maldonado has a .327 career batting average at Globe Life Park. ... Texas placed RHP Jeanmar Gómez on unconditional release waivers after designating him for assignment last Sunday. \n",

      " NEW YORK (AP) — DJ LeMahieu homered and hit an RBI double off the wall against Chris Sale, sending the surging New York Yankees to a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Friday night. \n",
      " Aaron Hicks broke a third-inning tie with a two-run single, and J.A. Happ (5-3) pitched well against Boston again to win his fourth consecutive decision overall. New York got four shutout innings from its deep and dominant bullpen, handing the defending World Series champions their third loss in a row. Adam Ottavino, Tommy Kahnle, Zack Britton and Aroldis Chapman each worked an inning to finish the five-hitter. Chapman struck out two in a perfect ninth for his 16th save. \n",
      " Despite a rash of injuries, the Yankees hold a 1½-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay — and a widening gap on the Red Sox. New York has won all three meetings between the longtime rivals this season, beating Sale (1-7) twice and outscoring Boston 17-4.

Bell's two singles gave him 94 total bases in May, the most by any player in any month in the franchise's 138-year history. Bell hit .389 in May with 12 home runs, 12 doubles and 31 RBIs. \n",

      " Fredericksburg, PA — \n",
      " FREDERICKSBURG - The start of the game was just fine for Hamburg, which worked the bases full in the first inning and then got a two-out hit to take a second-inning lead in the District 3 Class 4A baseball championship game Friday. \n",
      " But when things stopped going right, they really went wrong for the Hawks, who got caught in a big inning and never recovered in an 11-3 loss to East Pennsboro at Wenger Field. \n",
      " The third-seeded Hawks (19-7) made atypical mistakes in a 13-batter bottom of the second that resulted in seven East Pennsboro runs and an 8-2 deficit from which they couldn't recover against the top-seeded Panthers (22-2). \n",
      " \"Very uncharacteristic of Hamburg baseball and our team today, especially that second inning,\" said Hawks coach Nick Evangelista of the half-inning that included five hits, three errors, three walks, a hit batsman and a wild pitch. \"That's not us. We don't expect to beat anyone when we walk that many guys and commit that many errors. \n",
      " \"You take that inning out of the game and we have a chance then to do some things differently at the end of the game - get some bunts down, steal some bases and kind of have a different approach the last three or four innings.\" \n",
      " East Pennsboro, playing in the title game for the third straight year after winning in 2017 and losing to Berks Catholic last year, recovered from its own shaky start that saw the Hawks load the bases in the first while working deep counts against Nick Embleton, a St. Joseph's recruit. They broke through in the second when designated hitter P.J. Hanlon singled, Reece Adam reached on a fielder's choice and Tarik Feick lined a two-out, two-run single to center for a 2-1 lead. \n",
      " But pitcher Ethan Naftzinger, who got out of the first inning allowing one run after walking the first batter, didn't get out of the second. The first three batters reached on a hit, walk and hit by pitch, and leadoff hitter Alejandro Escalet and Zach Boyer followed with RBI hits, Boyer's a double to center for two runs. The Hawks' second error of the inning allowed another run to score, ending Naftzinger's start. \n",
      " Hamburg used two more pitchers before the 30-minute half inning ended. Embleton, who started dropping curve balls for strikes, gave up a leadoff walk in the third, then struck out the next three batters, and the Hawks were back in the field again. \n",
      " \"Tarik gets that hit, puts us up 2-1 and we're right back where we wanted to be,\" said Evangelista. \"His (Embleton) pitch count's climbing and it gives us an opportunity to do some things different, and then we go out and again, it's very uncharacteristic of us on the defensive end.\" \n",
      " Embleton settled in and finished with 12 strikeouts in four innings. Feick drove in Hamburg's third run with a two-out double to center in the fourth. \n",
      " Hamburg, which clinched a PIAA berth with its semifinal win over Kennard-Dale Tuesday, will open the state tournament Monday at 4:30 p.m. at Pittston High School against District 2 champion Dallas (17-6). \n",
      " \"Obviously we're here to win this game,\" said Evangelista. \"We set out every year to win this game. But I'm very proud of this ballclub. We're gonna go back in the next couple days and get mentally prepared and we'll be there Monday ready to go.\" \n",

      " BALTIMORE — The two players who occupied Camden Yards’ left-field grass for a lengthy first inning Friday night took similar yet diverging paths. Mike Yastrzemski, the Orioles’ 14th-rounder in the 2013 draft, dreamed of playing in Baltimore’s gem of a ballpark, but he did so Friday for the opposing team. Dwight Smith Jr., meanwhile, wasn’t a part of the Orioles’ organization until two weeks before Yastrzemski was gone, a former first-round pick by the Blue Jays designated for assignment and traded. \n",
      " The Orioles’ 9-6 victory over the San Francisco Giants saw Baltimore overcome its largest deficit of the year with plenty of firsts for both players, who carry with them a familial baseball lineage. Yastrzemski is the grandson of Hall of Famer Carl, but he had to grind his way through 703 minor league games, all in Baltimore’s system but the 40 he played this season, before getting the chance to play in the majors this week. Smith, whose father enjoyed a productive career in the 1990s, performed well in stints with Toronto. Neither was ever afforded the opportunity they have gotten with their current franchises. \n",
      " The Orioles, with too many Triple-A outfielders and not enough playing time to share among them, traded Yastrzemski for minor league right-hander Tyler Herb in late March. After hitting 12 home runs with Triple-A Sacramento, Yastrzemski finally got his callup, fittingly coming six days before the Giants’ first visit to Baltimore in 15 years. \n",
      " He did not wait long to make an impact in his debut in the ballpark he spent six minor league seasons envisioning as his future home. After Orioles right-hander Andrew Cashner began the night with a walk to Joe Panik, Yastrzemski tripled into the right-field corner for an RBI and scored on Buster Posey’s single. The Giants forced Cashner to make 46 pitches in a five-run first, leaving Yastrzemski on deck. \n",
      " San Francisco left-hander Drew Pomeranz nearly matched Cashner in first-inning pitch count, throwing 44. On the 39th, with the Orioles having already struck for two runs, Smith hit his first career grand slam to put Baltimore ahead 6-5. The shot ended an 0-for-13 skid that pushed Smith into the lower third of manager Brandon Hyde’s lineup for the first time. MASN cameras showed his father celebrating in the stands. \n",
      " After both teams scored at least five first-inning runs for the first time in Orioles history, Yastrzemski drove in another, hitting his first home run on Cashner’s first pitch of the second. He joined Dwight Evans as the only players with a homer and triple against the Orioles within their first six games in the majors. \n",
      " Orioles first baseman Trey Mancini shared Baltimore’s 2013 draft class with Yastrzemski, and the two rose through the minor league system imagining playing at Camden Yards together. Friday, they did so, with both homering. Mancini’s two-run home run in the bottom of the second gave the Orioles a lead they didn’t relinquish, ended Pomeranz’s outing and sailing far over the head of his friend standing in left field. \n",
      " Renato Nunez provided the final margin with a projected 444-foot home run in the seventh, his seventh home run in his past nine games. \n",
      " For the eighth time in his 12 starts, Cashner received at least six runs of support. \n",
      " Despite a 5.74 ERA in those starts, he improved to 5-0 in such outings. He did enough to make those runs hold up Friday, with Yastrzemski’s home run being the only run he allowed in his final four innings of work. He battled to complete five innings on a season-high 109 pitches. \n",
      " The bullpen was solid behind him. After 1 1/3 innings from Paul Fry, Mychal Givens recovered from a stretch of rough outings by retiring the three batters he faced with two strikeouts. Richard Bleier pitched the final 1 2/3 innings. \n",

      " Softball: Jenna Sylvia powers GNB Voc-Tech to its first-ever South Coast Conference championship \n",
      " Friday \n",
      " May 31, 2019 at 9:46 PM May 31, 2019 at 9:46 PM \n",

      " NEW BEDFORD — Every time Jenna Sylvia steps to the plate, the GNB Voc-Tech junior is confident. \n",
      " After striking out in her first at bat against Fairhaven in the South Coast Conference championship game on Friday, Sylvia slugged back-to-back home runs, driving in five runs as the Bears beat Fairhaven 13-4 for Voc-Tech’s first-ever conference championship. \n",
      " “It was crazy,” said Sylvia, who hit the first two homers of her varsity career in the game. “Even though I struck out the first time, I didn’t lose confidence.” \n",
      " Sylvia said she’s becoming more and more comfortable with her bat. \n",
      " “I’m having a much better opportunity this year for hitting than I did last year,” she said. “I hit at the beginning of the season last year, but it was a lot for me and I was the only pitcher so coach didn’t want to risk it. This year I’m just doing what I have to do.” \n",
      " Sylvia’s first home run — a two-run shot — flew just inside the left-field foul pole and put the Bears up 6-1 in the third inning. \n",
      " “The first one I did not think was out,” she said. “I was rounding first base and I was like ‘Oh geez.’ It just kept going. I don’t even know what to say.” \n",
      " In her next at bat, Sylvia sent a booming shot over the left field fence for a three-run home run and a 10-2 advantage. \n",
      " “This year she’s worked on her hitting more in the offseason and it showed,” said GNB Voc-Tech head coach Mark Collins. “She’s been hitting the ball really well this year. We’ve been letting her hit more.” \n",
      " Sylvia, who went 2-for-4 with five RBIs and two runs scored, picked up her eighth win on the mound, striking out five with four runs off five hits with three walks. \n",
      " “She’s having a day. That’s how the game goes,” said Fairhaven head coach Cathy Silva. “She’s a leader of their team, obviously, and to help her own cause is something special.” \n",
      " Sylvia wasn’t the only one with a hot bat. The Bears finished with 13 hits, including three home runs, a triple and a double. \n",
      " “They just out-hit us,” Silva said. “I told my girls you have to do it with your gloves and your bats and they’ve done it to us three times. Last year we had their number and this year they have our number.” \n",
      " Collins said his team has been hitting well for the past seven or eight games. \n",
      " “What’s nice is it’s not always the same ones,” he pointed out. “They’re comfortable. We’ve got a game plan and we try to execute it to the best of their abilities. They’re sitting there being patient and if you come into the zone, they’re on it.” \n",
      " Voc-Tech’s 13 hits came against a combination of freshman Bella Rocha Medeiros and sophomore Ragan Miller. Medeiros went the first 2 ⅔ innings before Miller pitched 1 ⅔ and Medeiros returned to close out the game. \n",
      " “I give them a lot of credit. They come up with big plays,” Silva said of Voc-Tech. “They hit the ball when they need to. They get the timely hits. They’re a great team. We’re a great team too, but we just haven’t showed it when we’ve played against Voke.” \n",
      " HOW IT HAPPENED \n",
      " The Bears struck first when Skyla Berube drove in Kylee Caetano with an RBI single in the bottom of the first inning for a 1-0 lead. Fairhaven responded in the top of the third to tie it up when Victoria Perry scored on a sac fly from Olivia Couto. \n",
      " Voc-Tech’s offense erupted in the bottom of the third when the Bears pushed across five runs on four hits, including home runs from Piper Crooks and Sylvia. \n",
      " Fairhaven put one run on the board in the fourth as Cassie Lavigne’s shot went over the left-field fence for a solo home run to pull the Blue Devils within 6-2. \n",
      " The Bears put the game out of reach in the bottom half when they plated four more runs, capped off by Sylvia’s deep ball and another hit by Crooks. \n",
      " Fairhaven scored two more runs in the fifth, but Voc-Tech answered with another three in the bottom of the inning to close the door. \n",
      " “The girls are playing well,” Collins said. “The defense is solid. The hitting is contagious. We’ve been squaring up a lot of ball lately and the pitching has been solid. Those three aspects have been working.” \n",
      " WHAT IT MEANS: The win was the 11th straight for GNB Voc-Tech. “We’ve been really hitting and playing well the last 11 games,” Collins said. “They’re really peaking at the right time, which we hope for every year.” … The Bears (17-2, 13-1 SCC) host Seekonk on Saturday afternoon. … The loss was the third this season for Fairhaven against Voc-Tech. A year ago, the Blue Devils swept the Bears and beat them in the SCC title game, but lost to them on Voc-Tech’s road to the state championship. … The Blue Devils, who fell to 15-4, visit Dighton-Rehoboth on Monday. \n",
      " BIG PLAY AT THE PLATE: Rylee Sniezek pinch hit for Elyse Rebelo in the fifth inning and won a 13-pitch battle with Sylvia when she sent the ball over the left field fence for a two-run home run. “She didn’t start and she usually starts for me so to come in a situation like that and to battle and win that battle with a home run, she wants to play,” Silva said. “She sent me a message with that hit. That’s what I want to see.” \n",
      " SILVA ON STARTING MEDEIROS ON THE MOUND: “We’re giving her a little experience. She’s only a freshman. She does a nice job. She needs the experience, but she’s going to be really good for us.” \n",
      " COLLINS ON CROOK’S HOMER: “Piper has been our best hitter all year long. She’s consistent. She finally got ahold of one and the ball was carrying out of here today.” \n",
      " FAIRHAVEN STATS: Lavigne went 2-3 with a home run; Victoria Perry was 1-for-3 with a run scored; Sniezek was 1-2 with an RBI and a run scored. \n",
      " VOC-TECH STATS: Crooks was 3-for-5 with two runs scored; Kylee Caetano was 3-for-4 with four runs scored; Shaylen Amaral was 1-for-3 with two RBIs and a run scored; Skyla Berube was 1-for-4 with two RBIs and a run scored; Skyler DuBois was 1-for-3; Janice Rullan was 2-for-3 with two runs scored. \n",
      " PITCHING DUO: With both Sylvia (8-1) and DuBois (9-1) enjoying success on the mound, Collins said he’s thinking about having them continue to split time in the playoffs. “That’s the game plan right now heading into the tournament,\" he said. \"Both kids are pitching well. So going into the tournament, we’re thinking about running them both and seeing how it goes.” \n",
      " FRIENDLY RIVALRY: Dating back to last spring, the Bears and Blue Devils have played each other seven times, with Voc-Tech winning the last four. “It’s always good playing Fairhaven. It’s always a good game,” Collins said. “We’ve played them seven times in (14 months) and it’s a little much, but it’s a good game.” \n",

      " Gallo's 1st career grand slam leads Rangers past Royals 6-2 \n",
      " By Associated Press&nbsp|&nbsp \n",
      " Posted: Fri 10:07 PM, May 31, 2019 \n",
      " ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Joey Gallo's first career grand slam capped a six-run, sixth inning outburst as the Texas Rangers rallied past the Kansas City Royals 6-2 Friday night. \n",
      " Gallo's home run, his team leading 16th of the season, sailed 457 feet and landed in the second seating area beyond the center-field wall. \n",
      " Ariel Jurado (2-2) won for the first time in three major league starts this season. Jurado allowed two runs on five hits and three walks. The second-year right-hander, who was recalled from Triple-A Nashville on April 26, had career highs in strikeouts (six) and pitches (101). \n",
      " Danny Duffy (3-2) lost for the first time since April 26. Carrying a two-hit shutout into the sixth inning, Duffy allowed all six runs, six hits and two walks - both in the sixth. \n",
      " Jesse Chavez, the first of three Texas relievers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning. He ran his scoreless streak to 17 1/3 innings in May, a franchise record for one month. \n",
      " Texas loaded the bases in the sixth inning on outfield singles by Shin-Soo Choo and Elvis Andrus and a chopper hit between third base and the mound by Hunter Pence. Duffy fielded Pence's grounder, but his throw to first base was late. \n",
      " Duffy walked Nomar Mazara with the bases loaded to tie the score 2-2. Gallo then launched a 1-1 fastball to end a six-game homerless streak, which matched his longest this season. \n",
      " Cheslor Cuthbert homered in his first major league at-bat of the season, and Alex Gordon tripled-in Kansas City's other run. Cuthbert, who earlier Friday had his contract selected from Triple-A Omaha, hit an opposite-field homer that just cleared the right-field wall in the second. \n",
      " Gordon's triple in the fifth inning turned around centerfielder Gallo and struck about midway up the wall in straightaway center, scoring  Adalberto Mondesi. In the third inning, Gallo broke in on a fly ball hit by Whit Merrifield that went over his head for a triple. \n",
      " The Royals lead the majors with 24 triples. \n",
      " Mondesi had his major league-leading 19th stolen base. That gave the Royals a major league-leading 53. \n",
      " PRE-GAME MOVES \n",
      " To make room for Cuthbert, the Royals designated INF-OF Chris Owings for assignment. The Rangers selected the contract of RHP David Carpenter from Nashville and optioned OF Zack Granite to Nashville. \n",
      " TRAINER'S ROOM \n",
      " Royals: OF Hunter Dozier (right thorax tightness) is day to day, leaving Thursday's game in the fifth inning and sitting out Friday. \n",
      " Rangers: OF Willie Calhoun (left quad strain) will begin on-field work on Saturday. \n",
      " UP NEXT \n",
      " Royals: RHP Homer Bailey (4-5, 5.79), having joined the Royals this winter following 12 seasons with the Cincinnati Reds, will make his Globe Life Park debut on Saturday. \n",
      " Rangers: RHP Lance Lynn (6-3, 4.67) has lowered his ERA from 6.51 over his last six starts, going 4-2. \n",

      " DETROIT (AP) — The Latest on the Detroit Grand Prix (all times local): \n",
      " 6:25 p.m. \n",
      " Josef Newgarden has won the first of two Detroit Grand Prix races, outlasting the competition Saturday on a rain-slicked road course. \n",
      " The Team Penske driver finished nearly a second in front of Alexander Rossi, who also was the runner-up at the Indianapolis 500, and Takuma Sato. Newgarden, who opened the year with a victory at St. Petersburg, joins Indy 500 champion Simon Pagenaud as the series' two-time winners this season. Newgarden has won 12 IndyCar races since 2015. \n",
      " Pagenaud finished sixth after starting 13th in the 22-car field on Belle Isle. \n",
      " The 70-lap race became a 75-minute timed event after thunderstorms delayed the start by more than an hour. There were five yellow periods due at least in part to conditions, leading to 14 laps under caution and 29 under green. \n",
      " ——— \n",
      " 5:50 p.m. \n",
      " Josef Newgarden led the Detroit Grand Prix midway through the 75-minute race. \n",
