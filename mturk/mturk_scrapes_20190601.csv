LOUIS (AP) - Matt Carpenter hit a game-ending single against an unusual defensive alignment in the 10th inning, and the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs 2-1 on Friday night. ### The Cardinals won back-to-back games for the first time since April 30-May 1 and avoided the worst winning percentage for May in franchise history by going 9-18 (.333). The worst May was in 1980 when St. Louis went 8-18 (.308). ### Kolten Wong helped set up Carpenter's clutch swing with a one-out double off Mike Montgomery (1-1) for the team's lone extra-base hit. Dillon Maples then came in and walked Harrison Bader and Jedd Gyorko to load the bases. ### Cubs manager Joe Maddon brought in Steve Cishek to face Carpenter, and put four players on the right side of the infield.

He was born on July 25, 1937 in Morganton, NC, the devoted only child of Phrona (Benfield) and Ralph Keller. The Keller's moved west, where Jerry spent his youth outdoors, scouting the North Cascades and as a young man, cultivating his entrepreneurial spirit with ingenious odd jobs in and around the Marblemount area. He worked in the timber business helping his father. Jerry graduated from Concrete High School, Class of '55 and went on to apprentice at Boeing while attending the University of Washington in mechanical engineering. He also worked for PACCAR on the Bradley Fighting Machine. Jerry took a break and motorcycled through Mexico and then began his long career as Lucas Machine owner making parts for NASA and Los Alamos. During this time, Jerry built his home in Kent on a 25 acre ""hobby farm"" while simultaneously building a house for his parents in their much-loved hometown of Concrete. He did make a yearly journey to compete in the big fish contest in Kona, HI, eventually landing a 614lb Blue Marlin. After retiring, Jerry enjoyed more fishing, hunting, farming, gardening, traveling and sailing. He was a live aboard sailor on the ""Kings Ransom"" sailboat for five years before making his home in La Conner and a second love nest in Arizona. So lived Jerry. Big hearted, kind, generous, brutally honest and a man of his word. Caring father, loving husband and loyal friend. Self-made man, natural-born salesman, life-long sailor and master storyteller. He was preceded in death by his parents, Phrona and Ralph, and his daughter Kimberly (7). Jerry is survived by his wife Diane Keller (married 6/13/98), daughters Teresa (Curt) Allen and Kristina Keller, stepdaughters Shannon Bowerman, Dawn (Damon) Laird, Colleen (Damon) Stewart and Heather (Kelly) Devlin, grandchild Coral Schoonejans and step-grandchildren Cameron Laird, Ashley Laird, Emma Stewart and Owen Stewart. A celebration to honor Jerry's life will be held at 2:00 pm, Saturday, June 15, 2019 at the La Conner United Methodist Church, officiated by the Rev. Marcella Baker.

40630,"Another record-setting run for Smith at provincial high school track and field championships ### The Chronicle Herald ### Published: a day ago ### Updated: a day ago ### King’s-Edgehill sprinter Aaliyah Arab-Smith powers her way to first place in the senior girls’ 100-metres at the NSSAF track and field championships in Wolfville on Friday afternoon. - Ryan Taplin ### Competitors couldn’t catch Maggie Smith in the senior girls’ 1,500 metres as she chased down the record book for a second consecutive year. ### The 17-year-old from Sacred Heart broke her own provincial mark in the event at the Nova Scotia School Athletic Federation track and field championships in Wolfville. ### In 2018, she ran 4:28.32 to shatter Robyn Meagher’s standard set in 1984 by seven seconds. On Friday, Smith shaved nearly seven seconds off her year-old record and crossed the finish in 4:21.94. ### Not only did Smith almost lap a few competitors at Raymond Field — not exactly common in the 1,500 — she broke off her first post-race interview to go hug the girls that eventually finished behind her. ### “My (personal best) is 4:24 from the indoor season, so anything under that I was happy with,” Smith said in an interview Friday afternoon. ### Smith would have posted an even faster time if she didn’t slow down sharply her last two strides before crossing the line. ### “That’s honestly a problem of mine, we work on it in practice,” said Smith, who will attend Villanova University this fall. “I think I was just excited, and also my legs didn’t have a lot left in them. ### “Definitely happy with today, but now I’m going out and trying to run PBs, or at least times I’m pleased with.” ### Sacred Heart’s Maggie Smith smiles after a record-setting victory in the senior girls’ 1,500 metres. - Ryan Taplin ### Smith, a triple gold medallist last year, will attempt the feat again when she runs in the 800 and 3,000 metres on Saturday. She won all three distance races in her first year as a senior in 2018, including an NSSAF-record 9:49.38 in the 3,000. ### “I’m excited for both,” Smith said. “I’m really excited about the 3,000, that’s the one I’m really looking forward to. But the 800 will always have a special place in my heart just because it was the first event that I actually started to get fast at. So it’s a special one, too.” ### While Smith seeks the trifecta in track, two Cobequid athletes are two-thirds of the way toward triple gold in field events. ### Michael Adams placed first in the senior boys’ shot put (13.05 metres), repeated as javelin champion (55.01m) and will seek gold in the discus on Saturday. ### “Mike’s the kind of guy who will come and do a job and get it done. He’s very consistent,” Cougars head coach Iain Lapointe said of Adams, who will attend UBC and join the Thurnderbirds’ track team in the fall. ### “He was expected to do well today, so he came and performed and he got it done.” ### CEC teammate Adam McEachern was runner-up in the shot put with a distance of 12.89m. McEachern came into provincials as an alternate after finishing fifth in the Northumberland regionals. ### Meanwhile, Noah Berniquer will be in the hunt Saturday for his third gold medal of the meet in the intermediate boys’ triple jump. ### On Friday, Berniquer was first in the long jump (6.11m) and javelin, with a provincial intermediate record 54.19 metres. Incidentally, he broke the record of 51.86m set by Adams in 2017. ### “Noah is an impressive athlete,” Lapointe said of the Grade 10 athlete. “He came in highly anticipated with the skills he has. He’s also a high jumper but we decided to concentrate on the three events. ### “He could’ve done two more if he wanted to,” Lapointe added with a laugh. ### “He is a gamer. He set personal bests in the javelin and the long jump and I wouldn’t be surprised if he did it again in the triple jump tomorrow.” ### Nicolas Beaulieu was a double gold-medallist on Friday. The Sommet runner won the senior boys’ 100 in 11.02, .46 of a second ahead of Auburn Drive’s Jaiden Williams. ### Beaulieu was also victorious in the long jump with a distance of 6.49m. ### Avon View’s Zach James also won two events on Friday. He finished first in the intermediate boys’ 100 (11.55) and 400 (51.69). ### In junior girls, Mya Archibald of George P. Vanier earned gold in the 100 (12.96) and high jump start (1.55m). ### Caledonia junior boys’ special athlete Desean Smith-Howe pulled off a triple-gold feat on Friday. He won the 100 (14.21), long jump (3.73m) and shot put (10.23m). ### Jillian Connors of Park View captured two gold medals in the senior girls’ special athlete 100 (16.83) and long jump (3.15m). ### All of Friday’s events except for the high jump were completed by press time. ### SLO-PITCH ### Host Amherst and Park View each collected a pair of wins at the Division 1 boys’ championship on Friday. ### Amherst defeated J.L. Ilsley 11-8 and Memorial 20-10 while Park View downed Sir John A. Macdonald 15-5 and C.P. Allen 15-4. ### In other games, Glace Bay defeated C.P. Allen 19-12, Auburn Drive downed Memorial 13-9, Sir John A. beat Glace Bay 23-19 and J.L. Ilsley topped Auburn Drive 21-11. ### Action continues on Saturday. ### At the Division 1 girls’ tournament in Sydney Mines, the host Memorial Marauders earned a pair of victories on Friday. ### Memorial defeated Millwood 11-1 and Halifax West 20-11. ### Four teams own 2-0 records while four others are winless at 0-2. ### Avon View, South Colchester Academy and Auburn Drive are also undefeated heading into Saturday’s play. ### The Avalanche dropped Halifax West 18-3 and Millwood 12-10.

2128,"News of the day from around the globe, May 31 ### News of the day from around the globe, May 31 ### Chronicle News Services ### Comments ### 1 ### Palestinians killed: Israeli police shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian near the West Bank separation barrier on Friday, Palestinian health officials said, while in Jerusalem’s Old City, an alleged Palestinian attacker was killed after stabbing and injuring two Israelis, according to Israeli police. The outbreak of violence came as tens of thousands of worshipers flocked to Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque for noon prayers on the last Friday in the holy fasting month of Ramadan. Israeli police shot and killed 16-year-old Abdullah Ghaith near the West Bank city of Bethlehem, the Palestinian Health Ministry said, adding that another 21-year-old Palestinian was wounded by a live bullet to the stomach. Israeli police said the Palestinian teenager was shot while attempting to climb over the heavily guarded separation barrier from Bethlehem into Jerusalem. ### 2 ### Nuclear deal: The U.N. atomic watchdog said Friday Iran continues to stay within the limitations set by the nuclear deal reached in 2015 with major powers, though its stockpiles of low-enriched uranium and heavy water are growing. In a confidential quarterly report distributed to member states, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran has stayed within key limitations set in the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The deal is meant to keep Tehran from building atomic weapons in exchange for economic incentives. It has been complicated by the unilateral withdrawal of the United States last year and Washington’s increased sanctions, which has been taking a toll on the Iranian economy. ### 3 ### Kabul bombing: A car bomb targeting a U.S. convoy exploded Friday in an eastern Kabul neighborhood, leaving four Afghan civilians dead and three wounded and lightly wounding four American forces, authorities said. It was the second suicide attack in as many days to rattle the Afghan capital. The suicide bomber struck as the convoy passed through Kabul’s eastern Yakatot neighborhood, where U.S. and NATO forces maintain complexes. ### 4 ### Papal visit: Pope Francis opened a three-day pilgrimage to Romania on Friday by delivering a new appeal for unity, 20 years after St. John Paul II made the first papal visit to a majority Orthodox country. Francis referred to that historic trip during his opening speech before Romanian government authorities and his subsequent meeting with Patriarch Daniel, head of the Orthodox Church. John Paul’s 1999 visit to Romania, just 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, was the first by a pope to a majority Orthodox country since the Great Schism divided Christianity in 1054. It’s the latest of Francis’ foreign trips to poor countries where Catholics are a minority. In Romania, they are a divided minority between two Catholic rites, Roman Catholic and Greek-Catholic. ### 5 ### Drug arrests: Indonesian authorities arrested an American, two Spaniards and two Russians for selling cocaine and marijuana on Bali, police said Friday. The three men and two women were paraded at a news conference in the Bali capital, Denpasar, days after being arrested. Police seized 0.7 ounces of cocaine and 1.6 ounces of marijuana from the group. Indonesia has strict drug laws and dozens of convicted smugglers are on death row. Its last executions were in 2016, when an Indonesian and three foreigners were shot by a firing squad. An Indonesian court last week sentenced a Frenchman to death for smuggling ecstasy to Lombok, next to Bali. ### Chronicle News Services",60119,1,"Palestinians killed: Israeli police shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian near the West Bank separation barrier on Friday, Palestinian health officials said, while in Jerusalem’s Old City, an alleged Palestinian attacker was killed after stabbing and injuring two Israelis, according to Israeli police.

1778,"By: Matthew VanTryon, IndyStar | May 31, 2019 ### NEW PALESTINE, Ind. – Here are some things you should know about New Palestine junior Michaela Jones: ### She’s known as Mic to her family, friends and teammates. She loves music. Her favorite artist is either Fleetwood Mac or Frank Ocean. She loves fashion, she’ll upcycle clothes or cut them up and turn them into something new. She loves her sister. They’re inseparable. ### She’s good at softball, too. She won a state title last season. She can catch, she can play shortstop, she can hit. She committed to Maryland as a freshman. ### You should know that her dad was largely out of the picture by the time she was 3 years old. She watched him slowly succumb to alcoholism and went to his funeral as a 6-year-old, not understanding why everyone around her was crying or that he wasn’t coming back. ### More Softball! ### Abby Herbst redefining domination as no-hitter wins Central Grove regional championship ### When she was a freshman, her world was shaken again when her best friend fell asleep and didn’t wake up. The death of Abby Rejer shook a community — including Michaela. ### You should know this: Michaela has been knocked down — again, again, again — and keeps getting back up. And she knows that you can, too. ### ‘She watched him slowly die’ ### Angela Phillips talks with fondness of her first husband, Jason Jones. He was a man of many talents — he loved music, could play instruments and everyone loved him. His uncle was a pharmaceutical guru, and his family was one of the wealthier ones in St. Louis. But he had demons, too. His own father had died when he was 19. Eventually, he took to the bottle. Quietly. ### “You would never know, if you knew him in the community we used to live in,” Phillips said. “People never knew he was struggling with this addiction.” ### Most of Michaela’s memories of her father are from the waning moments of his life. ### “He was a true alcoholic. It was a true addiction. She really didn’t have her dad after she was 3,” her mom said. “We did a lot of supervised visitations. She watched him slowly die.” ### Phillips eventually remarried and moved to Greencastle. Her second husband, Gary, was a former baseball player. Michaela took up the sport, and her older sister Mackenzie soon followed. One day, their father came to watch one of their games in Belle Union. ### “I’ll never forget this. He fell down in front of them and their stepdad had to go out and help him up and walk,” Phillips said. “She saw the weakest part of him. That was hard for her.” ### When Jason died, the explanation Phillips gave to Michaela was simple: He got really sick, and the doctors couldn’t do anything about it. ### “To tell her that her dad was dead was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do in my life,” Phillips said. “There was always that hope that he was going to get help and snap into the person I knew he could be and wanted to be, and she would learn how to play the guitar, and they would go to concerts together.” ### It wasn’t until middle school that Michaela would learn the real cause of her father’s death. ### “It’s a shock,” she said. “For the longest time I didn’t know what actually happened, and now I’m figuring it out. I had in my mind that it was just sickness. It was actually something more.” ### Sisterly Love ### Early on, softball became a source of healing. She started playing Tee-ball with the boys, then played softball, and was playing travel ball by the time she was in third grade. Her stepdad spent countless hours with her. ### “It helped us bond,” Michaela said. “He spent so much time working with us, it definitely brought us closer.” ### She always played with her sister, even though Mackenzie was two years older. It was a focal point of a friendship that transcends the baselines. But it’s undeniable that a bond was naturally forged through the loss of a parent. ### “No one else knows what that feels like besides us,” said Mackenzie, who just finished her freshman season at DePauw. “It makes it easier when you don’t have to go through something alone. No one else knows what we’ve been through, and it’s made us become closer in more ways than anything else has.” ### When Mackenzie started to practice her pitching, she needed a catcher. And her mom only lasted so long. ### More News! ### “Once you go over 50 miles per hour, I am not catching you,” Phillips told her oldest daughter. So Michaela stepped in. ### Michaela came into the New Palestine softball program as a freshman and the team needed a catcher… ### “She didn’t want to catch,” her mom said. “But (Mackenzie) said, ‘Mic, we need you.’” ### Two years later, Michaela would catch Mackenzie in the Class 3A state title game. They would end the day as state champions. ### “Winning that state title is something I’ll never forget,” Michaela said. “Being with her made it so much more special.” ### New Palestine High School sophomore Michaela Jones (22) has the help of teammate senior Mackenzie Jones (14) after her Championship medal broke after winning the 34th Annual IHSAA Softball State Finals class 3A game, Saturday, June 9, 2018, at Bittinger Stadium on the campus of Purdue University, West Lafayette. (Photo: Doug McSchooler/for IndyStar) ### A friend named Abby ### While Michaela and her sister have a strong bond, she admits “I pick and choose my friends wisely.” She largely keeps to herself. Her mom says Michaela “keeps her circle small.” So when she lost one of the people closest to her, it could have sent her world crumbling. ### Michaela met Abby Rejer in seventh grade, and the two quickly became part of a small group that was inseparable. Michaela and her friend played on the basketball team, and they convinced Abby to become a team manager. The group had lunch together every day. They had the same classes. They’d end up at the same house every day after school. Abby would help Michaela with homework. Phillips would check her daughter’s phone and see texts to Abby asking for advice. ### “Abby sounded like an old soul responding to Mic,” she said. ### During spring break of her freshman year, Michaela went to Disney World with a friend. She was riding a go-kart when she got a call from her mom. ### Abby had fallen asleep one night and didn’t wake up the next morning. An autopsy revealed no cause of death, leaving natural causes as the only explanation. ### “It was so hard,” Phillips said of the phone call. “How much she loved this kid was unreal.” ### “I just started bawling,” Michaela said when she heard the news. “I just ran off. We sat down and cried all night. It was just shocking.” ### She showed up at Abby’s funeral, and she was just one of many of Abby’s friends in attendance. ### “To the teenagers of this community, I do not even know what to say,” Abby’s mom Kristi Rejer said in a letter to the Greenfield Daily Reporter on April 12, 2017. “I have been awestruck by these kids and their strength. To show up at such devastation takes so much courage and dedication. We were astounded.” ### The day of the funeral, Michaela played in her first varsity softball game. In her first at-bat, she hit a home run. ### “That was Abby,” her mom said. “I just started crying.” ### More High School Sports! ### NCSA: Three keys to getting recruited for spring sports ### But one home run wasn’t enough to fix the pain Michaela felt. She says her mind is “always running and thinking about things all the time.” But she internalized her feelings. ### “I thought I would break down if I talked about it. I didn’t like being seen as someone who was sad,” she said. “I always liked to be seen as someone that’s happy. The summer after freshman year, I struggled a lot with my mental health. I would hold things in. I was probably depressed.” ### It’s OK to not be OK ### Eventually, things changed. It wasn’t a moment, but a choice. ### “I devoted my time to being happier and trying to dig myself out of that,” Michaela said. ### Sports helped. But even that wasn’t all smooth sailing. During basketball season her sophomore year, she sprained her knee during a collision in practice and was limited to just 16 games. Last January, she suffered a stress fracture in her back and missed the final eight games of the basketball season. ### Sitting out gave her mind plenty of time to wander. ### “Then I’m just sitting around. I’d think more,” she said. “Sitting there and not having something to take my mind off was definitely hard.” ### In the midst of the internal noise, her outward demeanor remained the same. On the court and the field, she exudes a quiet confidence that might overshadow her competitiveness. ### “She’s got a steady presence. She just hates losing,” Dragons basketball coach Sarah Gizzi said. “You might not know that watching her from the outside, but there’s definitely a fire in there. But she doesn’t let it affect her steadiness.” ### Her sister calls it swagger. ### “She’s calm and stays true to herself,” Mackenzie said. “She doesn’t show when she’s upset and goes with the flow. She has a swagger. It’s intimidating. You know she’s there to compete, but she’s quiet about it.” ### And when she’s on the field, everything else fades away. ### “You leave everything else that’s going on behind,” Mackenzie said. “You’re not worrying about anything else. If she didn’t have it, she might not have something to go to.” ### Michaela Jones of New Palestine High School slides in for a run as her team beat Kankakee Valley High School 13-6 for the 3A state softball title, on Saturday, June 10, 2017. (Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) ### This softball season has come with its own challenges. Namely, Michaela has had to navigate life without her sister being around. ### For the first time, she wakes herself up in the morning. She gets her own coffee. She drives herself around town. ### “She’s kind of like my mom, pretty much,” she says of Mackenzie. ### Oh, and one more thing. ### “The clothes. She took like half my wardrobe. That was hard.” ### But the relationship goes beyond coffee and car rides. ### Michaela’s emotional healing process began internally. If her thoughts began to race, she would pause and focus on a sound in the room or the color of a wall. She’d put pen to paper, writing her thoughts down to get them out of her head. ### Eventually, she began to vocalize her feelings — especially to her sister. ### “There’s stuff you don’t want to go to your parents about. You want to go to your sister,” Mackenzie said. “We’re comfortable. There’s no judgment. We can talk about anything.” ### Now, Michaela is focusing on helping others who are struggling. Some of her closest friends have lost their parents. ### “I bond with people that are like me,” she said. “If someone’s struggling with something, I try to reach out. It’s probably hard for them to reach out to someone else because I was once in that place, and I know it’s hard if you’re not feeling like your best self.” ### Something else she’s learned? It’s OK to not be OK. ### Her other suggestion? Pick up a hobby. ### “Without softball, I would have a lot more free time, almost too much, to the point where my thoughts would overtake me,” she said. “I wouldn’t have any way to get my mind off things.” ### She has plenty to accomplish during the last chapter of her high school career, starting with Saturday’s semistate softball games. But her steadiness won’t change. She’ll still listen to Fleetwood Mac and stay up to date on the latest fashion trends. She’ll still beg her sister to spend a night at home. She’ll quietly go about her business, putting up big numbers along the way. ### But even if she doesn’t, that’s OK too. ### “I put less pressure on myself,” she said. “I’m building relationships and having fun, and it’s almost a coping mechanism. Even if I have a bad game, it’s not the end of the world. There’s more things out there than just softball.”",60119,1,"“ To the teenagers of this community, I do not even know what to say,” Abby’s mom Kristi Rejer said in a letter to the Greenfield Daily Reporter on April 12, 2017. “ I have been awestruck by these kids and their strength.

Top-rated NHL draft prospect Hughes is scheduled to meet with the media on Friday, May 31, 2019, while attending the league's pre-draft scouting combine in Buffalo. Petr David Josek, File AP Photo ### BUFFALO, N.Y. ### Dan Marr will never forget the first time Jack Hughes landed on his radar as a potential top NHL draft prospect. ### It happened last summer, when the NHL Central Scouting director was attending a skills camp in Toronto. ### After listing New Jersey's Taylor Hall, Edmonton's Connor McDavid and then-Islanders captain John Tavares as the best three players on the ice, Marr added: ""The next best player was Jack Hughes."" ### Even at 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds, Marr said the 17-year-old stood out for a variety of reasons. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to Tri-City Herald content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### ""It was a series of drills that they were doing that involved skating, quickness, speed, execution, precision. And right away you could see he already has an NHL shot,"" Marr said Friday, speaking at the NHL's annual pre-draft scouting combine being held in Buffalo. ""So he's got the talent that he belongs in that group."" ### Very little has happened to change Marr or anyone else's mind since. ### From Orlando, Florida, Hughes is Central Scouting's top-ranked North American skater after spending the past two seasons setting USA Hockey National Team Development Program's record by combining for 228 points (74 goals, 154 assists) in 110 games. ### Finland's Kaapo Kakko is the top-ranked European skater after completing a season in which he helped his nation complete a gold-medal sweep of international titles by winning the world championship last weekend, the world junior title in January and the Under-18 title last year. ### The two are projected to be selected with one of the two top picks — the Devils select first followed by the New York Rangers — at the NHL draft at Vancouver, British Columbia on June 21-22. ### After joking he'd look good in either a red Devils' or blue Rangers' jersey, Hughes said he'd obviously prefer to go first. ### ""You always dream of being No. 1,"" Hughes said. ""You don't dream of being two, three or four when you're a young kid."" ### Hughes is also aware of how he and Kakko will draw comparisons with the likelihood of the two playing on Metropolitan Division rivals. ### ""We'll be linked to each other for a lot of years with the Rangers and Devils right there,"" Hughes said. ### Kakko is not attending the combine because the weeklong event, which includes player-team interviews and medical testing, began a day after Finland beat Canada to win the world championships in Slovakia on Sunday. ### ""It has zero affect really,"" Marr said about Kakko's absence. ""I think the teams understand that. And the teams at the top, they're just going to have to spend a little bit more time with him when he comes over for the draft."" ### The two players differ in size and style of play. ### At 6-foot-2 and 194 pounds, Kakko is known for his goal-scoring ability and considered more of a power forward. ### He led Finland with six goals in 10 games at the World Championship. His 22 goals in the Finnish Elite League last season were the most by a draft-eligible player. ### Hughes is a swift-skating, play-making center. He comes from a hockey family. His brother Quinn Hughes is a defenseman who was selected by Vancouver with the No. 7 pick in the draft last year. His father, Jim Hughes, is a former hockey coach, who also served as the Toronto Maple Leafs director of player development. ### Hughes credits the time he spend playing youth hockey in Toronto as playing a key role in his development. ### ""Toronto's probably the capital of the hockey world. You win the Greater Toronto Hockey League finals, you think it's the Stanley Cup,"" he said. ""Do I think I'd be the player I am today without Toronto? Probably not. ... That's the reason I'm here today."" ### Hughes also played at the worlds and finished with four assists in four games for the United States, which was eliminated by Russia in the quarterfinal round. ### Among the highlights was getting the opportunity to play with NHL stars such as Chicago's Patrick Kane. ### Hughes grew up idolizing Kane as they're both under-sized forwards who play a similar style. ### It came as a shock to Hughes upon hearing Kane pay him a compliment by telling NHL.com he believes Hughes ""does a lot of things better than me."" ### ""You almost think he's full of (baloney),"" Hughes said, before listing the three Stanley Cups and numerous other awards Kane has won. ""You name it, he's got it. To hear your name out of his mouth is one thing. To hear him say those nice things about you truly shows how good of a person he is.""",60119,1,"Undersized Hughes stands out as top NHL draft prospect | Tri-City Herald###Undersized Hughes stands out as top NHL draft prospect###By JOHN WAWROW AP Hockey Writer###May 31, 2019 04:14 PM###ORDER REPRINT →###FILE - In this May 19, 2019, file photo, United States' Jack Hughes controls the puck during the Ice Hockey World Championships group A match against Denmark in Kosice, Slovakia.

The cause and location of death were not revealed. ### ""It's almost unfathomable to contemplate a world without Roky Erickson. He created his own musical galaxy and early on was a true inspiration,"" Gibbons said in a statement. ### After the trippy 13th Floor Elevators dissolved in the face of drug arrests and instability, Erickson in the early '70s entered an insanity plea to a marijuana possession charge and ended up spending some time in an institution. ### A short-lived effort to reunite the Elevators followed. Erickson put out a book of poetry — ""Openers"" — and continued making music, including the songs ""Two Headed Dog"" and the LP ""The Evil One."" ### In 1986, he released the album ""Don't Slander Me,"" and a 2005 documentary by Keven McAlester about him was called ""You're Gonna Miss Me.""

Both had to overcome 3-0 deficits in their Champions League semifinals, with Liverpool stunning Barcelona and Tottenham defeating Ajax with almost the last kick of the second leg. ### Tottenham hasn't reached any continental final since winning the now-defunct UEFA Cup in 1984. And this season has been only the north London club's sixth appearance in the European Cup - with five qualifications coming since 2010. ### Liverpool is England's most successful side in the European Cup, lifting the trophy five times - most recently in 2005. But the Merseyside club lost the 2007 final and again last year to Real Madrid. ### That was the sixth successive final Juergen Klopp has lost, with the Liverpool manager yet to win a trophy since joining the team in 2015. The team only missed out on a first English title since 1990 when Manchester City defended its title by one-point. ### ___",60119,1,"Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

She attended University Park, East Junior High and graduated from Kelly Walsh High School in 1982. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in Theatre and Dance from the University of Wyoming in 1987. While at UW she completed an internship with the Kennedy Center where she helped to organize the National College Theatre Festival. ### She and her husband Rob, moved to Washington, D.C. where she continued her education at American University, and in 1991 was awarded a Master of Arts Administration. Following, she worked at Wolf Trap Performing Arts Center. She and Rob returned to the west where she accepted a position at AIMS Community College in Greeley and later at Red Rocks Community College in Denver. ### She, Rob and son Avery returned to Casper with her appointment to Casper College as the Executive Director of the Casper College Foundation. During her tenure at Casper College, Paulann directed the completion of the largest campaign in Casper College history overseeing the “Vision: Campus: Community” fundraising campaign, welcomed the iconic “Essence of Rex” statue to the campus—- including the celebratory “T-Rex” cake. Her campaign funded five new buildings on the Casper College campus (Walter H. Nolte Gateway Building, the Residence Hall, the Early Childhood Learning Center, the Casper College Student Union and University of Wyoming at Casper Building and the Music Building.) Under her leadership the college presented over $7.5 million in scholarships, $21.9 to support the college and increased the foundation assets by over $44 million. ### Her career included many accolades including the presentation of a named scholarship at Red Rocks Community College in 2015, and the Commitment to Excellence Award from Casper College in 2019. ### Paulann married her high school sweetheart, Rob Doane in Casper on January 2, 1987 and was blessed with son Avery on October 8, 1997 and together with Rob and Avery welcomed Zach into the family on April 6, 2017. ### Paulann collected friends throughout her life with whom she never lost touch. She loved dogs, cats, music, wine and Tom Petty. Paulann put the Soup Nazi to shame with her creations. Her stuffed shells were her son’s favorite meal. Her home was always open to “homeless” nephews and stinky high school boys – the couch and the fridge were available for as long as was needed. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### Paulann loved to travel and most recently enjoyed a family trip to Hawaii where she thoroughly loved snorkeling and riding high above the volcano on a helicopter, as well as a trip with Rob, her parents, brother Matt, and sister-in-law Jenny to Washington D.C. On this trip she was excited to see old friends and enjoyed visiting the National Gallery and viewing presidential portraits. Always among her favorite excursions were trips to Lander because that meant visiting and spending time with her extended Doane family. ### She laughed easily and often. At herself, Rob’s jokes, the cat’s antics, and frequently was the first to laugh with her father and brothers after lengthy and heated political discussions as she bravely dissented with the prevailing republican sentiment. ### She had absolutely no sense of direction and once commented that MapQuest was created just for her. When Rob was asked to be the official to sign her niece’s marriage license, Paulann required the couple to first complete pre-marital counseling (which she designed and facilitated) at her dining room table. ### She hated that she wasn’t able to tan and was overjoyed when the pale healthy look became vogue. She loved the mountains, camping with Rob in their R-Pod, sitting on her back patio, dancing, music and even managed to win the annual Tanner Thanksgiving Cribbage Tournament—once. ### She is survived by husband, Rob; sons, Avery and Zach; parents, Robert and Jane Tanner; siblings, Stuart (Daney), Eric (Cori), and Matt (Jenny); along with many nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, cousins and grands. She was always supported by Rob’s parents, Alan and Shirley Barkley; sisters-in-law, Judi Davis and Marian Doane. ### Services will be held at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church on Monday, June 3rd at 11:00 am. ### In lieu of flowers donations are requested to the Paulann T.

53279,"JONES: Alberta Sports Hall of Fame inductees an accomplished, humble group ### JONES: Alberta Sports Hall of Fame inductees an accomplished, humble group ### Terry Jones ### May 31, 2019 8:50 PM EDT ### Filed Under: ### RED DEER — For most of their careers, they’ve shared the same sports sections together, some of them in the front and others in the back and others nowhere to be found. ### And every year here it happens. ### The inductees to the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame who haven’t been as celebrated as some of the higher-profile people involved, end up being the inspirational stories of the evening. ### This year that happened before the doors even opened. ### Friday the inductions featured the Ferbey Four curling team that spent most of their careers on the front pages of the sports sections winning four Briers and three world championships together. ### But Randy Ferbey, Dave Nedohin, Scott Pfeifer and Marcel Rocque sat in awe of the others in the Class of 2019 here last night, especially as they witnessed George Stothart be inducted. ### Stothart had battled to stay alive since he was informed in the fall that he would be inducted in the Hall. ### He’d been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and few expected he’d make it. ### “He has an optimistic heart,” said son Perry. ### “We were all hoping that he could. He’s 115 pounds now. He’s pretty weak. ### “He’s had good and bad days. Some of have been good and other days I think he was disappointed that he woke up. I think he’s ready. But we’re pretty sure it’s going to be a great event for him. ### “He’s a pretty humble guy. He’s definitely a guy who didn’t do it for he accolades, but he’s clearly honoured by this. Sport has been his life. Growing up in Lacombe, this is close to home and we’ve all been looking forward to him being able to feel the energy of the room,” said his Edmonton-based son, who would deliver his speech, flanked by two “flying fingers” friends to sign it for the hearing impaired who were here to share his day with him. ### George Stothart was born deaf. ### I grew up as a kid in Lacombe being inspired by Stothart. So this one is personal. ### Stothart played high school football in Lacombe and went on to play for both the Edmonton Huskies and U of A Golden Bears. He competed at three World Deaf Games, twice on the Canadian basketball team in 1965 and 1973 and a third time, in 1969, as a 400-metre runner. ### He played basketball at SAIT and formed ‘Flying Fingers’ fastball and basketball teams in addition to serving on the board of the Federation of Silent Sports of Alberta for years. ### But Stothart’s passion was refereeing basketball. ### He became Alberta’s longest serving basketball official working games from the time he was a 15-year-old kid to 2017, when he retired. ### That was 64 years as a basketball referee. In the peak of his officiating career he officiated 287 games. ### “In his last season, when he was 79, he refereed over 200 games of basketball.” ### The family loves to tell stories about some of his games. ### “One player had been shouting at him about a call and was getting more and more upset that he was getting no reaction. Finally he yelled ‘Are you deaf?’ The other referee said ‘As a matter of fact he is,’ ” said Perry. ### “He was a great lip reader and loved to call personal fouls though.” ### Another inspirational story in just getting to the induction evening was former University of Alberta Golden Bears football coach Jim Donlevy, who also has serious medical problems and battled through most of the month trying to get strong enough to make it. ### “I spent three weeks and two days in the hospital and just got out a week ago. I’ve had internal bleeding and crap and I don’t know … ### “All I’ve concentrated on for the past week is to be strong enough so that I could stand up to give my speech.” ### Donlevy was the head coach of the University of Alberta Golden Bears football team when they were semi-regulars at the Vanier Cup, losing in 1971, winning in 1972, winning again in 1980 and losing again in 1981. He ended up with an overall 89-69-3 record as Golden Bears head coach. ### Donlevy, from 1993 to 2015 made a major career change, joining the Western Hockey League to build a scholarship program for players now considered one of the most comprehensive in the hockey world today. ### “I’m just overwhelmed,” said Donlevy. “I didn’t expect anything like this at all.” ### One member of the Ferbey Four, last rock thrower Dave Nedohin, a barefoot water skier of some note, was thrilled to be going into the Hall with water skier Kreg Llewellyn. ### Llewellyn, from nearby Innisfail, was just happy to be responsible for a water skier to make it in. ### “I think what means the most to me is to get the exposure for the sport of water skiing in the Hall of Fame. I’m, just proud that water skiing is in here.” ### Llewelyn, an integral part of the Canadian National Water Ski team for more than two decades, held 224 Canadian records and won seven individual world championship medals and three team world championship gold medals in addition to 18 Pan-American medals — seven gold, nine silver and two bronze. ### With Lacombe represented to the North and Innisfail to the South, bobsledder Lyndon Rush had the West covered. He lives in Sylvan Lake. ### Rush has made more visits to the Hall than the rest of the Class of 2019 combined. He volunteers to take school classes through, never thinking that one day he might be able to show them his own plaque. ### If there was a theme to the Class of 2019 it was that most of the inductees never dreamed of one day making it into the shrine located on the QEII. ### “Like everybody else, I was just totally in awe to walk through the Hall of Fame,” said Dorothy ‘Dot’ Padget. ### “I don’t think anybody donated volunteer time over 45 or 50 years for any other reason than loving their sport. To be recognized for what we loved to do like this is just an amazing thing to have happen to you.” ### Padget became involved in synchronized swimming almost 50 years ago and became a FINA judge, judging more than 50 international events in more than 20 countries in the world. ### Ted Thresher wasn’t thinking of becoming a Hall of Famer when he took up wrestling. ### “I was 136 pounds. There are not many sports you can take up. I fell in love with the sport but I kept getting beat up,” he laughed. ### “So I became a referee and I got a chance to work at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.” ### Thresher went on to co-chair the wrestling portion of the Edmonton 1978 Commonwealth Games and was also instrumental in putting together Edmonton’s successful bid to host the 1992 World Wrestling Championships and served as executive director. He also officiated at 48 events including five world championships, three Pan-Am Games and three Commonwealth Games. ### His favourite memory, though, was Montreal. ### “I’m sitting there and the Duke of Edinburgh sat next to me. He asked me to explain what it was all about. When I’d finished the next bout was about to begin between a wrestler from Great Britain and Canada and I said, ‘I’ll bet you five bucks that the Canadian beats him.’ He was game for that. But just as the Canadian won it, his security people came down and said ‘Time’s up, sir. You have to go.’ So this evening is not only an incredible thrill for me, it also provides me with the opportunity to tell the world that the Duke of Edinburgh still owes me five bucks.” ### Another wrestler, Herman Dorin, took up the sport at the University of Alberta in 1949, founded the Edmonton Amateur Wrestling Association and formed high school wrestling teams in Winfield, Bentley, Airdrie and Didsbury. He went in as the winner of the Pioneer Award. ### Dorin, after listening to several new Hall of Famers speak of how surprised they were to be selected, broken the gathering up. ### “It’s about time,” he said and then made it quite clear he was the most surprised of all. ### The Bell Memorial inductee from the media was long-time Calgary radio sports talk host Rob Kerr, who also said he didn’t see it coming. In fact, when he got the call he thought they might be phoning to ask him to MC. ### In addition to the Ferbey Four, there was one other inductee involved who spent his career at the front of the sports section. That was hockey player Mike Rogers. ### Former Calgary Centennials junior and Edmonton Oilers WHA player, Rogers’ claim to fame was becoming only one of four players in NHL history to reach the 100-point plateau in his first three seasons, the others being Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and Peter Stastny. He produced 105 points in each of his first two seasons after the WHA merger with the Hartford Whalers and had a 103-point year in his third year in the league with the New York Rangers. ### But he, too, said a call to the hall caught him by surprise. ### “It’s one of the proudest moments of my life. After the shock, I tried to get my head wrapped around it and it’s still absolutely amazing. Then you get here and are surrounded by all these absolutely amazing people who are becoming Hall of Famers with me. They’ve had some incredible journeys.”",60119,1,"JONES: Alberta Sports Hall of Fame inductees an accomplished, humble group###Terry Jones###May 31, 2019 8:50 PM EDT###Filed Under:###RED DEER — For most of their careers, they’ve shared the same sports sections together, some of them in the front and others in the back and others nowhere to be found.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]","<p>JONES: Alberta Sports Hall of Fame inductees an accomplished, humble group</p><p>Terry Jones</p><p>May 31, 2019 8:50 PM EDT</p><p>Filed Under:</p><p>RED DEER — For most of their careers, they’ve shared the same sports sections together, some of them in the front and others in the back and others nowhere to be found.</p>",620

You know, you’re going to play games. You’re going to come up against quality opposition,” Du Plessis said. ### “England were better than us in all three facets of the game. They showed why they are such a good cricket team, and now we have to look at the league. It’s a league competition. ### “For me, it’s about making sure we look at the areas that we got it wrong and just move on.” ### South Africa’s disciplined bowling against England gives Du Plessis reason to believe they still have plenty to offer. ### ‘Beautiful action’ ### Lungi Ngidi was their leading wicket-taker with three in his 10 overs, including the prize scalp of the destructive Jos Buttler. ### Fellow pace bowler Kagiso Rabada also offered a glimpse of his talent with two wickets and Du Plessis expects them to put Bangladesh under pressure. ### “Lungi, he’s got a beautiful action. The way he came back (from a slow start) was beautiful. You know, to get Jos Buttler out, he’s probably one of the best strikers in the world,” he said. ### “So to get him out with good thinking, good tactics. Lungi, Kagi, those guys are going to play a role when it comes to close games at the death as the tournament moves on.” ### Bangladesh will be playing their first match of the World Cup as they look to better their run to the quarter-finals in the 2015 edition. ### Mashrafe Mortaza hopes to be fit to captain the team despite suffering a hamstring strain while bowling during their warm-up match against India on Tuesday ### “A lot of times in such cases I face trouble bowling the first one or two overs. Once I get through that, I don’t face any more problems,” he told Dhaka-based bdnews24. ### “But I pulled a hamstring during the sixth over,” he added. ### “I could have stopped after four or five overs but Rohit (Sharma) and (Virat) Kohli were looking to score runs quickly during that period. I felt that I needed to practise bowling in such a situation,” he added. ### Tamim Iqbal did not play against India due to a thigh strain, but the opener is expected to be fit to face South Africa. ### ...",60119,1,"‘Beautiful action’###Lungi Ngidi was their leading wicket-taker with three in his 10 overs, including the prize scalp of the destructive Jos Buttler.###Fellow pace bowler Kagiso Rabada also offered a glimpse of his talent with two wickets and Du Plessis expects them to put Bangladesh under pressure.###“ Lungi, he ’s got a beautiful action.

71705,"MLB Odds Roundup: Latest Division Betting Futures ### Updated ### Jun 1, 2019 at 11:23am ### Getty Corey Seager and the Los Angeles Dodgers sit in first place in the NL West. ### Monday was the Memorial Day holiday in the United States, and it’s often considered the first “official” checkpoint of each season in Major League Baseball. History also has shown that teams leading their division are more likely than not to make the playoffs despite so much of the season still to be played. ### Since MLB instituted the wild card in 1995, around 60 percent of division leaders on Memorial Day have made the playoffs via whichever route. Last year, the six division leaders on the holiday (May 28) were the Boston Red Sox (AL East), Cleveland Indians (AL Central), Houston Astros (AL West), Atlanta Braves/Washington Nationals (tied atop the NL East), Milwaukee Brewers (NL Central) and Colorado Rockies (NL West). ### The Red Sox, Indians, Astros, Braves and Brewers won their divisions. The Rockies lost a one-game playoff to the Los Angeles Dodgers but were a wild-card team. The Nationals missed the postseason. ### One doesn’t want to declare any division race over this early in the year, but it sure looks as if Houston will win the AL West for a third straight season and the Dodgers will take the NL West for a seventh in a row as both have huge division leads. The Astros are -6600 on their MLB division odds at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com and the Dodgers are -3500 on theirs. Frankly, it’s not worth the return barring major injury to one of those two teams. ### Just one division realistically has four teams that could win it: the NL Central. The Brewers beat the Chicago Cubs in a one-game playoff last year and are +160 to repeat at sports betting sites . The Cubbies are the current leaders despite a horrible start to the season and are +135 favorites. The St. Louis Cardinals (+600) are more than capable of winning it, while the Pittsburgh Pirates (+600) might be overachieving, but stranger things have happened. ### The AL East should be tight all season between the New York Yankees (-130), Red Sox (+410) and Tampa Bay Rays (+190). That the Yankees are leading the East despite so many major injuries is shocking – and bad for the Red Sox and Rays because those guys will all be back eventually. Plus, the Yankees have the money to go out and acquire anyone, just like Boston does. Tampa Bay probably doesn’t. ### The NL East appears to be a two-team race between the Philadelphia Phillies (-175) and Braves (+275), while the surprising Minnesota Twins (-1000) continue to pace the AL Central.  ### Published ### Jun 1, 2019 at 11:23am ### Read More",60119,1,"The Red Sox, Indians, Astros, Braves and Brewers won their divisions.

These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border."" The Chamber has long supported a relatively open immigration policy, arguing that immigrants on the whole boost the economy. ### Trump said he will impose the tariffs by using his powers in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act , which authorizes the president to investigate, regulate, or prohibit transactions with foreign countries in order to protect national security. ### Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, argued Thursday that the president was overstepping his legal authority. ### ""Trade policy and border security are separate issues. This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent,"" he said. ### Other business groups said they will lobby hard to get the White House to back down on the proposed tariffs. ""We have taken our concerns to the highest levels of the administration and strongly urge them to consider carefully the impact of this action on working families across this country,"" said National Association of Manufacturers President Jay Timmons on Friday. ### Share your thoughts with friends. ### More Washington Examiner ### Joseph Simonson ### Saturday June 01, 2019 ### SAN FRANCISCO — California Sen.

Her death was ruled a fentanyl overdose by the Ashtabula County coroner’s office. ### The Trents were friends of Kranauer and her drug supplier, County Prosecutor Nicholas Iarocci said. ### “It is alleged that the Trents were complicit in supplying Ms. Kranauer the drugs that caused her death,” Iarocci said. ### Over the past several years seven people have been prosecuted on manslaughter charges in similar cases, which carries with it a sentence of three to 10 years in prison. ### Officials, who are attacking the opiate epidemic on a number of different fronts, believe the investigation and prosecution of such cases is having an effect and serving as a deterrent, Iarocci said. ### The result has been a reduction in the number of overdose deaths, Iarocci said, though he added every death cannot be investigated because of a shortage of resources and evidentiary obstacles. ### “Law enforcement cannot simply sit on our hands and not investigate these deaths,” he said. “If someone is found to be a part of the supply chain of drugs that caused another’s overdose death, we will charge and aggressively prosecute that person for manslaughter and other applicable criminal charges.” ### Tags",60119,1,"Variably cloudy with scattered thunderstorms.

86237,"Asylum seekers tell Irish committee chilling stories and ask government to ‘treat them as human beings’ ### 0 comments ### Asylum seekers in Ireland have spoken out about their treatment by the government. Appearing in front of a committee on justice and equality, they pointed to the cruelty and unfairness of Ireland’s asylum system. They argued that they “are human beings”, and all they ask “is that we be treated as such”. ### “State sponsored poverty” ### Members of the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland ( MASI ) gave a statement detailing their treatment as asylum seekers in Ireland. MASI’s representatives argued that its members “are uniquely placed to offer direction” on asylum issues in Ireland. They stated that: ### Human rights are not gifts bestowed by governments and institutions; they are rights and entitlements that we all possess by virtue of being human.  ### Email Address ### Mobile number (optional) ### × ### Therefore, there must be no difference in treatment between people on the basis of their ethnicity or nationality. In spite of this, MASI pointed out that the government bans asylum seekers from working while living in direct provision — the system by which the government houses asylum seekers while it’s assessing their applications. ### As a result of this ban on work: ### Continue reading below... ### Bryan Wall , ### 29th May 2019 ### There are children in Direct Provision forced to grow up in State sponsored poverty as their parents are unable to provide for their material needs. Many of them are too ashamed to tell their friends in school where they live. ### MASI members also revealed  that: ### A mother once told an Irish court that she had to sell sexual favours in order to support her child while living in Direct Provision. ### Asylum seekers in crisis ### MASI’s representatives also stated that “distressed asylum seekers” regularly get in contact with their group. They noted one case of a woman living in direct provision who is HIV positive. Given the lack of privacy, the other residents found out about her illness and “ostracised” her. ### They also related the story of a woman who was unfairly treated by the International Protection Office ( IPO ). According to its website, the IPO is “responsible for processing applications for international protection”. This means it’s in charge of assessing asylum seekers. But the woman, who is from the LGBTQI+ community, told MASI that the IPO didn’t find her “credible”. And as a result, it refused her application for protection. MASI said: ### This means that the IPO believes she is lying about her sexual orientation and wants her to prove her sexual orientation. ### MASI’s spokespeople argued that the asylum process should “vindicate” people’s rights, not “dehumanise” them. ### Making a change ### MASI went on to make  recommendations regarding how to make the asylum process more just. It called for the government to give asylum seekers “all necessary legal advice”. And it insisted “that the system is orientated towards vindicating peoples’ right to seek asylum and to live in safety”. ### It further  demanded that the government give asylum seekers the right to work. And it asked the government to scrap direct provision. Instead, it argued that: ### people seeking asylum in Ireland should have access to the same housing supports via their local authorities as is the case for others. ### MASI also told those present: ### We are human beings like you. All we ask is that we be treated as such. The very fact that people have to ask the government to treat them humanely should shame all of you. ### The mental health of asylum seekers ### During exchanges with the politicians gathered, members of MASI explained in more detail the Irish asylum system. And this included highlighting its many problems and the pressures asylum seekers live under. Donnah Vuma, also a member of MASI, explained how mental health issues are difficult to deal with in the current system. ### She said : ### Mental health is a serious issue for people living in direct provision. The biggest problem, I think, is that there’s no services at all that have been provided to us in the centres. ### She also pointed out that some children living in direct provision are suffering from mental health issues. As a result of direct provision, she revealed how her youngest child has been dealing with mental illness, saying: ### Over the past few months he has been showing signs of depression, to the point that he has come to me and said to me, ‘Sometimes when I feel sad I feel like killing myself’. This is a 9-year-old that is saying this to me. ### Ending direct provision ### Asylum seekers in Ireland have previously staged protests regarding their treatment. It is now on the government to do something for them. And this starts by listening to asylum seekers, ending direct provision, and treating them like humans. ### Featured image via Oireachtas.ie – screenshot ### Since you're here ... ### We know you don't need a lecture.

The twisted ladders in the icefall, the exhilarating anxiety of being in a tent on a small platform carved into the mountain at Camp Three, but also seeing some of the inexperienced climbers around him. ### ""We saw lots of examples of people being short-roped in the icefall and dragged up ... and that is just after base camp,"" he said.

He waited for the crowds to clear and as he headed out saw people with frostbite getting dragged down by their Sherpas. ### If you're dreaming of climbing Mount Everest, this is what it takes ### ""They are screaming and begging their Sherpas, 'Please let me stay and rest for five minutes,' and the Sherpas are like, 'Nope, if you want to have any chance of living and getting evacuated out of here we have got to drag you down all the way to Camp Two where a helicopter can pick you up,'"" Ian remembered. ""That was sort of a 'wake-up' moment when you re-remembered that this place is no joke."" ### Ian was able to start out at a decent pace, but then he hit the traffic jam near the summit. ### ""When you get to the top, part of the problem with the lines is people go to the top and they are coming back down, and it's this very narrow single-file ledge,"" he explained. ""It's difficult to move up because people are also coming down ... and you can't really move while they are coming around you because there is nothing between them and 8,000 feet below."" ### Everest icefall, the first challenge that climbers face as they head for Camp One. ### He describes seeing dead climbers along the way, no less jarring even though he was prepared for it, and watching people not knowing how to clip on and off, being barely able to walk or hold themselves up. ### Most climbers take two oxygen tanks. One is used most of the way up the mountain and ends up around half full. This is left at what is called ""the balcony"" at about 27,500 feet. The other tank is meant to take the climber from this point up to and then back down from the summit, at over 29,000 feet. The levels of oxygen released by the tank are regulated based on the time the final ascent takes, but lessening those can be risky. ### 'Like a war scene' ### Ian had calculated that it would take him eight hours to get to the top, but it eventually took him 12. ""The first point of panic really hit me at the summit. I was up there with our guide and he looked at me and said, 'Hey, we are both really low on oxygen, we gotta go.'"" ### But they got caught in the bottleneck at Hillary Step, an almost vertical rock face close to the summit. ### ""I was sitting up there with 2.5 hours of oxygen left, sat there for 40-45 minutes and you are just watching time dwindle away,"" Ian remembers. ### ""So everyone just queues there and that is when tempers start flaring a little. You hear people scream, 'Mount Everest isn't the place to come learn how to mountain climb,' and the screaming rattles the inexperienced people even more."" ### Traversing ravines in the ice. Everest isn't as technical as it used to be, but it still requires significant experience to mitigate the dangers. ### It then got even worse -- a storm moved in. ### ""The howling winds are pelting you with ice and you are seeing people strewn all over the mountain and you are wondering is anyone going to survive,"" he describes. ""I can't believe that more people didn't die. It was like a war scene up there with all the lines and inexperience and shouting and people freaking out with their oxygen running out."" ### Why Mount Everest is the wild climb they can't resist ### Ian felt like he was in a race for his life, one he very seriously risked losing. What kept him going was his mantra to his wife. Over and over he repeated, ""I promised I would get back home, I promised I would get back home."" ### He said was he was filled with gratitude and very lucky that one of the Sherpas in the group brought an extra bottle of oxygen up from the balcony. ### ""When I got to the end of the descent ... about half an hour away from Camp Four, I just started breaking down crying, just at anger with myself at coming that close to not fulfilling that promise ... so what fueled me was probably shame and embarrassment,"" he remembered. ### Shocking news ### Once Ian reached Camp Four, his tent ended up next to Robin's. Robin was a few days behind him and he had posted on Instagram about the crowds, writing, ""I am hopeful my decision to go on the 25th will mean fewer people."" ### A post shared by Robin (@1c0n0clast22) on ### May 19, 2019 at 1:15am PDT ### At this point, Ian was exhausted and grateful to be alive, while Robin was filled with excited anticipation at the challenge ahead, especially since the crowds had mostly cleared. ### ""We spoke through the tent for a while, I told him, 'Hey, make sure you eat and drink a lot, it's really difficult with the oxygen mask, you will run out of energy,'"" Ian said. Robin asked Ian to tell his girlfriend that he was ""in good health ... in good spirits (and) ready to go for the summit."" ### Ian then headed down the mountain. Back at base camp, he was sitting in his tent about to message Kristyn when the tent manager came in and told him that Robin had died on the mountain . ### Robin Haynes Fisher died while descending from Everest's summit on May 25. ### ""I was utterly shocked, disbelief, no way. It just unfathomable to be honest, Robin was more than fit enough to climb the mountain, I couldn't believe it."" ### What happened to Robin is unclear. Ian says the Sherpa he was with said he just collapsed 100 meters down from the summit. They tried switching his oxygen, reviving him and giving him water, but he was gone. ### No experience required ### The death toll on Everest this year has opened a debate about what needs to be done. Many climbers CNN spoke to, including Ian, said that this is due to a combination of factors: the number of permits granted, combined with a lack of experience among climbers, coupled with the weather phenomena. ### These myths about Mount Everest feed its mystique (and its traffic jams) ### Nepal's government denies that deaths attributed to inexperience and overcrowding were the result of its permit process. Danduraj Ghimire, director general of the Nepal Tourism Department, blames the weather for causing climbers to rush the summit at the same time, noting that the dangerous traffic jams do not occur every day. ### Ghimire said that only nine more permits were issued this season than last year. Each costs about $11,000. While Nepal does not have any experience requirements for climbers purchasing permits, the government is thinking about changing that, he notes. ### Ian Stewart covered in icicles and snow collapses in his tent after summiting Everest. ### Ian has spoken to Kristyn every day since Robin's death, and she wants to make sure Robin's climbing gear is donated to the local Sherpa community and to create a memorial for him, along with the other monuments to people claimed by the mountain, on the path to base camp. ### Summiting Everest has changed Ian, but not in the way he had always imagined it would. ### ""It was a dream come true to be here -- you revere this place, this mountain and now having been up it I have this jaded view,"" he says. ""This is a place where real people die, they don't get to live out the rest of their lives, they are chasing a hill.""",60119,1,"""When I got to the end of the descent ... about half an hour away from Camp Four, I just started breaking down crying, just at anger with myself at coming that close to not fulfilling that promise ... so what fueled me was probably shame and embarrassment,"" he remembered.###Shocking news###Once Ian reached Camp Four, his tent ended up next to Robin's.

JOHN CLANTON/Tulsa World file ### John Clanton ### Report ranks Oklahoma third in nation in poor bridges ### OKLAHOMA CITY – A recently released report indicates Oklahoma ranks third in the nation for the highest percentage of bridges in poor condition. ### The information was released by the Coalition Against Bigger Trucks from Federal Highway Administration data. ### Large companies including Amazon, FedEx, UPS and Anheuser-Busch are lobbying Congress to allow heavier trucks and longer double-trailer trucks, according to the coalition. ### Tulsa World journalism makes a difference. Be part of the story. Join us. Start a digital subscription for only 99¢. ### “Any increases in truck size and weight passed in Congress could negatively impact the state of Oklahoma and its bridges,” said Shane Reese, Coalition Against Bigger Trucks spokesman. “Bad infrastructure is also a highway danger and not only a highway danger to private motorists but to professional truck drivers and law enforcement officers patrolling the road alike.” ### The Coalition Against Bigger Trucks, a nonprofit founded in 1995 and based in Virginia, has asked Congress not to increase the size and weight limits on trucks. Legislation is already pending that would allow for heavier trucks nationwide, Reese said. ### The coalition receives money from the railroad industry and the trucking industry, he said, but most of the money is from the railroad industry. The organization also has support from law enforcement and local officials. ### “Like so many rural communities, my county is hard pressed to find the next nickel to keep up with our road and bridge maintenance,” said Cleveland County Commissioner Rod Cleveland. “Let me be clear, we’re nowhere close to being able to keep up now, but bigger trucks would incur such incredible infrastructure costs that I don’t see how we’d recover.” ### Oklahoma ranked behind Iowa and Pennsylvania in bad bridges, according to the group. The state had nearly 11% of its bridges ranked as poor. ### Oklahoma has 23,116 bridges, of which 2,540 are in poor condition, Reese said. ### Terri Angier, Oklahoma Department of Transportation spokesperson, said she was puzzled by the ranking. Recent reports have Oklahoma ranking 10th or 11th, she said. The organization used data on bridges maintained by the state and local entities, such as county governments. ### ODOT has 6,800 bridges, while counties have 16,000, she said. In recent years, ODOT has made a significant reduction in bridges deemed structurally deficient. ### Featured video ### Chief Photographer Tom Gilbert went up in a helicopter to show what the flooding looked like on Friday.",60119,1,If you are a nonsubscriber: You have used your free views allowed every 30 days.

""I hope that this year it happens."" ### While he dropped a set for the third straight match, Thiem showed more flashes of his dominant clay-court game in a 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 win over Pablo Cuevas on Saturday to advance to the fourth round. ### ""It was my best match so far,"" Thiem said. ""Not at all perfect yet, but the best so far."" ### For a spot in the quarterfinals, Thiem will face Gael Monfils and likely a partisan crowd, too, against the French player. ### The other fourth-round matchups set Saturday: top-seeded Novak Djokovic vs. Jan-Lennard Struff; No. 5 Alexander Zverev vs. No. 9 Fabio Fognini; No. 8 Juan Martin del Potro vs. No. 10 Karen Khachanov; and No. 6 Stefanos Tsitsipas vs. No. 24 Stan Wawrinka, the 2015 champion. ### All top 10 men's seeds are in the fourth round of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time since the 1970 Australian Open. ### When Massu looks at Thiem's game it feels a bit like staring in the mirror. Massu used a similar style in winning gold medals in both singles and doubles at the 2004 Athens Olympics. There's the big kick serve out wide, the heavy topspin, running around the backhand. ### ""Many of the things that Dominic does today I was doing also, years before,"" said Massu, who started working with Thiem this year. ""Same ideas. So I understand what he wants."" ### Massu made an immediate impact on Thiem's game when he guided him to his first Masters series title in Indian Wells, California, in March — which was surprising because until then Thiem's best results had come on clay. ### Thiem reached the semifinals at the French in 2016 and 2017 before losing to Rafael Nadal in last year's final. He also has four career wins at other tournaments over Nadal, the 11-time Roland Garros champion. ### Massu understands the expectations surrounding his pupil. ### ""It's normal that they put the name of Dominic (as) one of the favorite players, because of the results that he had in the past,"" Massu said. ### Thiem, however, is becoming quite comfortable in Paris, where he also reached the final of the boys' tournament in 2011. ### ""Eight years ago when I made the final of the juniors I fell in love with this tournament,"" Thiem told the crowd after beating Cuevas. ### Then Thiem, who is dating French player Kristina Mladenovic, entertained the crowd inside Court Suzanne Lenglen with a few words in French, apologizing for his beginners' grasp of the language. ### At 25, Thiem has plenty of time to learn. ### ""When you are 25 years old you are not even in the (halfway point) of your career,"" Massu said. ""The good thing about Dominic (is) he has the time."" ### Already up to No. 4 in the rankings, Thiem sits behind only Djokovic and Nadal, who are both 32, and Roger Federer, who is 37. ### ""He knows that he has the chance one day to be No. 1 in the world,"" Massu said. ""You never know when — maybe soon, maybe later — but he works for that."" ### A trophy in Paris would be a big step toward the top. ### ———",60119,1,""" Dominic has a chance to win the French Open for sure, one day,"" his coach, Nicolas Massu, said in an interview.

88050,"Mayor tells of visit to Israel ###  ### Saturday ### Jun 1, 2019 at 6:48 AM ### About a week before Topeka Mayor Michelle De La Isla went to Israel, Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched nearly 700 rockets at that country from Gaza. ### Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted 240 of those. Still, the missiles killed four people and injured more than 200. ### De La Isla said she felt very impressed during her subsequent visit to see the fortitude shown by the people of that nation as they continued to go about living their daily lives. ### ""To come face to face with a community that has had so much trauma, and to see how they have been able to be so resilient, was absolutely moving,"" she said. ### De La Isla was among five U.S. mayors who traveled to Israel while taking part last month in a week-long educational seminar arranged and paid for by the American Jewish Committee in an effort to further-enhance relations between Israel and the U.S. ### The others were Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, St. Petersburg, Fla., Mayor Rick Kriseman, Albany, N.Y., Mayor Kathy Sheehan and Gresham, Ore., Mayor Shane Bemis. ### Garcetti told the Jewish Journal, “Our delegation is showing how cities lead on the world stage, how mayors get things done and how urban centers can tackle everything from innovation and climate change to immigration and economic growth.” ### The five were invited because of their interest in international diversity and their desire to build bridges between the U.S. and other parts of the world, De La Isla said. ### The visit came about through a memorandum of understanding between the American Jewish Committee and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, with which De La Isla is involved. ### She said she did considerable reading about the history of that part of the world before leaving on the trip May 11. ### Last month was an interesting time to be in Israel because it is preparing to hold another election after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a governing coalition after his Likud Party’s apparent triumph in the election that country held April 9, De La Isla said. ### She said she learned about how Israel is among the world's most advanced countries in terms of technology. ### De La Isla told of meeting officials, including Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. ### ""He was a very kind gentleman,"" she said. ""It was very interesting."" ### De La Isla said she and Rivlin talked about the depth of the relationship between their two countries. ### ""He was talking about how important that relationship is and how he's going to do everything he can to continue that great relationship,"" she said. ### Flying over the country was also interesting, De La Isla said. ### ""If you fly over Israel, you'll notice that you'll have pockets and a lot of empty land, and all of those pockets are different places that are based on religion,"" she said. ### Some of those pockets consist solely of Jewish people, De La Isla said. Others consist only of Muslims, or only of Christians. ### ""Typically these individuals never get to interact,"" she said. ""And in a time such as this, in which our country and our world are talking and grappling with how do we all come together, it was really interesting to be in a place where people typically don't."" ### In Haifa, however, the mayor said she found that Christians, Jews, Muslims and people of the Baha'i and Druze faiths co-exist, and at times communicate through art. ### She talked of walking through the streets in that city and seeing artistic images that included the Jewish Star of David, a carving of a Muslim temple and a mosaic of a dove, symbolizing Christianity. ### Never miss a story ### Choose the plan that's right for you. ### Digital access or digital and print delivery.",60119,1,"De La Isla was among five U.S. mayors who traveled to Israel while taking part last month in a week-long educational seminar arranged and paid for by the American Jewish Committee in an effort to further-enhance relations between Israel and the U.S.###The others were Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, St. Petersburg, Fla., Mayor Rick Kriseman, Albany, N.Y., Mayor Kathy Sheehan and Gresham, Ore., Mayor Shane Bemis.###Garcetti told the Jewish Journal, “ Our delegation is showing how cities lead on the world stage, how mayors get things done and how urban centers can tackle everything from innovation and climate change to immigration and economic growth. ”###The five were invited because of their interest in international diversity and their desire to build bridges between the U.S. and other parts of the world, De La Isla said.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]","<p>De La Isla was among five U.S. mayors who traveled to Israel while taking part last month in a week-long educational seminar arranged and paid for by the American Jewish Committee in an effort to further-enhance relations between Israel and the U.S.</p><p>The others were Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, St. Petersburg, Fla., Mayor Rick Kriseman, Albany, N.Y., Mayor Kathy Sheehan and Gresham, Ore., Mayor Shane Bemis.</p><p>Garcetti told the Jewish Journal, “ Our delegation is showing how cities lead on the world stage, how mayors get things done and how urban centers can tackle everything from innovation and climate change to immigration and economic growth. ”</p><p>The five were invited because of their interest in international diversity and their desire to build bridges between the U.S. and other parts of the world, De La Isla said.</p>",639

1108,"By Matt Shuham ### June 1, 2019 1:30 pm ### President Donald Trump announced Friday that he would give a Presidential Medal of Freedom to the “trickle down” economics evangelist and co-author of “Trumponomics,” Arthur Laffer. ### “Arthur B. Laffer, the ‘Father of Supply-Side Economics,’ is one of the most influential economists in American history,” read a press release from the White House Friday afternoon. “He is renowned for his economic theory, the ‘Laffer Curve,’ which establishes the strong incentive effects of lower tax rates that spur investment, production, jobs, wages, economic growth, and tax compliance.” ### The medal will be awarded on June 19, the White House said. ### Laffer is perhaps best known for advancing the belief that cutting taxes on the wealthy and corporations, which Donald Trump and congressional Republicans did to a significant extent in late 2017, will increase tax revenue and benefit the economy overall. ### Trump’s timing is notable: A  nonpartisan analysis from the Congressional Research Service released last week found that, far from the Republicans’ tax cuts “ paying for themselves ,” as was widely asserted as a talking point during the 2017 debate over the tax cut legislation, the cuts did not have their advertised effect. ### The Los Angeles Times summarized : “The CRS finds that the cuts have had virtually no effect on wages, haven’t contributed to a surge in investment, and haven’t come close to paying for themselves. Nor have they delivered a cut to the average taxpayer.” ### ""If you cut that tax rate to 15%, it will pay for itself many times over… this will bring in probably $1.5T net by itself."" —Art Laffer pic.twitter.com/cXxGBtxqz1 ### — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) September 21, 2017 ### Laffer, along with right-wing pundit Stephen Moore , who was briefly considered for a Federal Reserve Board nomination, together wrote “Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy.” ### It’s hardly the first time Trump has used the powers of his office to boost an ally: In May, he issued a pardon for his friend, former business associate and author of “Donald J.

13688,"Policy ### Donald Trump’s war on cars is pushing the US closer to a recession ### New taxes on Mexican goods would be the latest blow to automakers, and would come at a precarious time ### Email ### When President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Mexican goods this week , he delivered the latest blow in a war he’s waged on automakers since before he was elected. It’s not a given he’ll follow through on the threat, or that he’ll implement other tariffs he’s dangled over cars coming into the country from Europe and Japan. The US and Mexico could also reach a deal before they go into effect on June 10th. But as he continues to escalate his fight against foreign-made cars, some experts think the US will move closer to another recession. ### The tariffs are on “all goods” coming to the US from Mexico, but they’d likely hit the auto industry hard. If they escalate to the 25 percent cap Trump proposed, and the automakers absorb the entire cost so as not to pass it onto consumers, it could cost General Motors (GM) $6.3 billion, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) $4.8 billion, and Ford $3.3 billion, according to a Deutsche Bank estimate . While it’s unlikely that automakers will eat the entire cost, the figures help explain what’s at stake. By the end of Friday, the threat of the tariffs alone had already wiped out about $17 billion of market value from the world’s biggest automakers . ### Mexico exported $93 billion in vehicles and parts to the US in 2018 ### Many of those automakers assemble cars in Mexico to be sold in the US, or build cars using a mix of Mexican-made parts. In 2018, Mexico exported $93 billion in vehicles and parts to the US. Major foreign automakers like Audi, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, and Mazda assemble cars in Mexico, many of which are destined for sale in the US. A number of top-tier suppliers like Denso are also located in the country. ### On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied,.. ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2019 ### But those “big three” American automakers might be most at risk. More than a quarter of GM’s domestic Chevy and GMC brand sales in 2018 were from vehicles assembled in Mexico, according to Cox Automotive . And almost 40 percent of Ram trucks sold by FCA were built in Mexico. Ford is less exposed by comparison, but about 10 percent of its total US sales come from Mexican imports. ### The tariffs put automakers in a tough spot: either they absorb the added cost or they pass it on to their customers, says Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive’s Autotrader. Since profit margins are already thin in the auto industry, it’s unlikely they’ll eat the full cost if the tariffs go into effect, and especially if they rise. That likely means that the prices of cars will go up, and sales could go down. ### America’s “big three” automakers are at risk ### GM, FCA, and Ford all declined to comment, instead referring to trade groups like the Auto Alliance and the American Automotive Policy Council. ### “[Tariffs] are a tax on our customers, which means they’re harmful to our nation’s economy and the millions of American jobs that depend on cross-border trade,” Auto Alliance interim president and CEO David Schwietert said in a statement provided to The Verge. “Any barrier to the flow of commerce across the US-Mexico border will have a cascading effect — harming US consumers, threatening American jobs and investment, curtailing the economic progress that the administration is working to reignite, and potentially stalling efforts to ratify the agreement in Mexico, Canada, and the US Congress.” ### Trump originally said he announced the new tariffs this week because he wants Mexico to stop immigrants from crossing into the US illegally. Citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trump announced late Thursday night that the US government will place a 5 percent tax on all goods coming into the country from Mexico starting June 10th. The tax, according to an official White House statement, will increase to 10 percent on July 1st, 15 percent on August 1st, 20 percent on September 1st, and ultimately reach a cap of 25 percent on October 1st. ### Tariffs are “harmful to our nation’s economy.” ### If, at any point, “the illegal migration crisis is alleviated through effective actions taken by Mexico,” the White House wrote, the tariffs will be removed. The White House did not describe what those “effective actions” might look like, though, and said only that they would “be determined in our sole discretion and judgment.” ### But Trump admitted the tariffs are also about forcing automakers to move their manufacturing efforts to (and in some cases, back to) the US. “In order not to pay Tariffs, if they start rising, companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA,” he wrote on Twitter Friday. ### It’s very unlikely that will happen, according to Krebs. “An automaker is not going to just all of a sudden say ‘I’m not going to produce vehicles in Mexico’ and move all that production to the US,” she says. “It’s just not that simple.” Moving manufacturing to a new plant in the US would cost billions of dollars and take years to pull off, even if automakers were to return to shuttered plants like the one GM recently left in Lordstown, Ohio. “I would not expect anybody to change production plans,” says Krebs. ### Trump admitted the taxes on Mexican goods are also about cars, not just immigration ### The same probably goes for the supply chain companies in Mexico, according to Doug Betts, the head of JD Power’s global automotive division. “[These] are not things that change or can be changed overnight at all,” he says. ### Betts also says that, even if automakers were willing to move to avoid tariffs, it’s not a given that they would move manufacturing back to the US. ### “If you’re an automaker, and you think this is the way it’s going to be for the next 10 years, you say ‘hey, we can’t we can’t live with this, we can’t pay a 25 percent tariff, so we need to start moving them somewhere else where they won’t be so expensive,’” he says. “But that somewhere else might not necessarily be the United States. It could be India or Africa or who knows what.” ### In order not to pay Tariffs, if they start rising, companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA. Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels. The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals! ### — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2019 ### Repatriating manufacturing has been a goal for Trump since well before he took office. For years, Trump has slammed companies across a number of industries for outsourcing manufacturing jobs to other countries, like when he famously shamed heating, ventilating and air conditioning manufacturer Carrier for trying to move production to Mexico during the 2016 presidential campaign . Carrier initially appeared to capitulate, and Trump claimed victory — before Carrier ultimately moved hundreds of jobs to Mexico anyway. ### Trump has particularly focused his rage on the auto industry, though. GM, for instance, is a popular target for him. The automaker announced in late 2014 that it planned to invest $5 billion in Mexico over the next six years, even though it already had four complexes with 14 manufacturing facilities in the country. So early on in his campaign, Trump tried to get GM to establish manufacturing facilities in lower-wage US states instead of leaving Michigan for Mexico. ### GM didn’t back down from its Mexican investment plans , though it agreed to invest $1 billion in the US in 2017. But in 2018 the automaker announced it was closing multiple US plants and laying off thousands of workers . Trump fumed, and has spent the intervening months sparring publicly and privately with GM CEO Mary Barra about the closures. In May, Trump touted the “GREAT NEWS” that GM was in talks to sell one of the plants, but it turned out the potential buyer is a startup that is in serious financial distress . ### Trump has fought with automakers about where they build cars since before the election ### GM is not Trump’s only target. In April 2016, Ford announced plans to spend $1.6 billion to build a factory in Mexico where it would make small cars like the Fiesta and the Focus. It had also previously announced a separate plan to invest $2.5 billion in new engine and transmission manufacturing facilities in the country. Trump’s reaction in June 2016 was to threaten Ford with a 35 percent tax on its Mexican exports . ### Trump continued to criticize Ford’s Mexico plan even after he became president. Ford finally scrapped the plan in 2017 — only to turn around and announce that it would build the cars in China . Then, in 2018, Ford announced it would stop selling the Focus in the US entirely due to Trump’s budding trade war with China . ### More recently, the president has lashed out at global automakers. He’s threatened similar 25 percent tariffs on cars imported from the European Union and Japan, and claimed that cars and parts brought in from other countries are a national security threat . ### Some of Trump’s other trade policies have also hurt the auto industry. His tariffs on steel and aluminum cost GM and Ford about $1 billion each , and Fiat Chrysler around $500 million. ### This week’s move, then, is just another salvo in a now years-long war Trump has waged against automakers and suppliers who don’t directly serve up jobs in the US economy. And it’s all coming at a precarious time for the auto industry, Krebs says. Overall, vehicle sales in the US have slumped since reaching a record of 17.55 million in 2016 , and the situation isn’t much better in other global markets. The average selling price of cars in the US is near all-time highs, thanks largely to the increased popularity of SUVs and trucks, which tend to cost more. And American consumers owe a record $1.27 trillion in car loans, and more of them are late on their payments than ever before . ### The US is facing “an imperfect storm” ### Add all this to the trade war with China, potential taxes on cars coming from the EU and Japan, and now the ones on Mexican goods, and the US could be dealing with “a perfect storm,” Krebs says. “Or an imperfect storm, really.” ### “We’ve always said if all if all these tariffs that have been proposed go into effect it could push the economy into a recession,” Krebs says. “It not a huge potential, but it is increasing.” ### Betts is similarly cautious about jumping into panic mode, particularly because automakers haven’t cut prices yet despite the dip in sales. So he’s watching to see if that happens. ### “When everybody gets in a war to try to save their [sales] volume, prices go down, and then the auto companies lose money and then they have to idle plants, and take drastic action,” he says. “And that’s what turns into a recession, because when you send 10,000 people home for a month, they all have to tighten their belts.” ### If Trump’s tariffs on Mexican goods never materialize, or if the two countries find some kind of agreement on immigration, that would help avoid putting extra pressure on the economy, both Krebs and Betts say — even if it likely won’t stop him from warring with automakers over where they build their cars. ### But even in that situation, Trump’s latest threat might wind up hurting the economy another way. The US has spent months negotiating the USMCA, Trump’s replacement for NAFTA, which he tore apart at the end of 2018. Just this week, vice president Mike Pence was in Canada putting the finishing touches on USMCA , while Mexico’s new president readied the deal for ratification in his own country . By announcing new tariffs on Mexico while all this was happening, Krebs says Trump is jeopardizing the ongoing trade talks with the rest of the world. ### “We’re negotiating all kinds of other trade agreements with Japan with Europe and China that affect the auto industry,” she says. “How does that sit with them, that we negotiate a deal, and now we’re changing it?”",60119,1,"“ We’re negotiating all kinds of other trade agreements with Japan with Europe and China that affect the auto industry,” she says. “ How does that sit with them, that we negotiate a deal, and now we’re changing it? ”","[124, 125, 126, 127, 128]","<p>“ We’re negotiating all kinds of other trade agreements with Japan with Europe and China that affect the auto industry,” she says. “ How does that sit with them, that we negotiate a deal, and now we’re changing it? ”</p>",647

Pretty cool and heaps healthier for you and the planet, says NA Sujatha ### “I have not paid an electricity bill since my husband and I moved into our own home last year. We live well within 100 units,” says NA Sujatha, marketing manager, Brookefields Mall in Coimbatore. She hates wastage, generating leftovers and clutter. “We have no air-conditioners but do have bamboo curtains that allow cross-ventilation. We also do not use any chemical-based cleaners. I use besan (gram flour) for a lot of things — from my hair, as a soap, as well as to clean vessels,” she says. ### Most astonishingly, Sujatha and her husband do not own a fridge! “A refrigerator leaves one of the largest carbon footprints. And we decided we did not want to contribute to that,” she says simply. It is not like she never owned a fridge. She grew up with one at her parents’ home and later at her in-laws’. But not any more. “It is a question of just getting used to it. Working with WWF and other eco-friendly organisations taught me about how we can contribute to a cleaner and greener planet. My husband and I decided that we did not need a fridge to live well. And I have so much more space at home!” ### Incidentally, Sujatha is also instrumental for organising a lot of green events at the mall and has played a big part in convincing visitors to carry cloth bags even before the plastic ban came into force. At home, she segregates waste at source and, if at all they have to dispose off vegetable peels and other food waste (almost unheard of in her house, she declares), they put it into paper bags made from old newspapers by her husband and only then bin it. “What we send out of the house is minimal,” says Sujatha. ### If you want to banish your fridge, here are some tips. ### How do you store vegetables? ### I believe that there is ‘prana’ in fresh vegetables that fades away and dies if they are kept too long. So I buy just enough fresh produce to last two days. For example, I may buy greens and a sturdier and longer-lasting vegetable like beetroot. I use up the easily perishable vegetables first and then use the beetroot. If we plan, this is easily doable. Eggs too can be kept outside, they have a shelf life. ### What about the life-savingidlibatter? ### I grind batter twice a week. I don’t see why I should grind for the entire week at one go. This way, I use up the batter and make a fresh batch when I next need it. I use millets instead of the usual rice and I find it keeps well. Like the veggies and fruits, the fresher the batter, the tastier and healthier whatever you make out of it. ### Milk can curdle, especially in the summer months... ### Yes it can. So we buy just what is required for the day. After we use it for breakfast, the leftover milk is set into curd. We consume it the same day and start afresh the following day. ### So cooking is also something you exercise restraint in? ### Absolutely. I do not want leftovers. We cook just enough. If there is more than what we can eat, we share the food right away. ### I have not paid an electricity bill since my husband and I moved into our own home last year. We live well within 100 units. ### Sujatha NA",60119,1,"“ I have not paid an electricity bill since my husband and I moved into our own home last year.

There is a perspective that it is a Russian Iskander missile, or it is a new tactical ballistic missile,"" he said. ### ""There are data that we can verify, and we are working off those data to make sure we have a verification."" ### Jeong was responding to a question on whether the tests were a violation of a military agreement between South and North Korea last September to halt acts of aggression against each other. ### He said the North was ""in fact acting within the boundaries"" of the agreement and tensions between their militaries ""have been lowered to a significant extent."" ### ""So currently the actions done by the North Korean regime have the intent to carry out the peace process through dialogue and talks. And I believe that's the hidden intent behind the lines in terms of their missile launches."" ### Jeong called on the international community to ""assure North Korea that the decision to denuclearize is indeed the right decision."" ### He said that South Korea sees humanitarian aid and the lowering of military tensions as ways ""to lead North Korea into conversation and away from ... the ways of the past."" ### North Korea itself has defended the launches, saying it was exercising its right to self-defense. ### The U.S. and Japan say the short-range ballistic missile tests on May 4 and 9 were a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The tests ended a pause in launches that began in late 2017, and came amid deadlocked negotiations to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons. ### Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya, who spoke at the same session on Korean security, stressed that a strict implementation of sanctions against North Korea was necessary. ### He specifically directed his comments at South Korea, China and Russia. ### ""We need to enhance surveillance on a global scale while strengthening effort locally to ensure the full implementation of sanctions,"" Iwaya said. ### Earlier Saturday, U.S. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan told the Shangri-La Dialogue conference that North Korea ""remains an extraordinary threat"" and has ""neared a point where it could credibly strike regional allies, U.S. territory, and our forward-deployed forces."" ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

96576,"Copyright © 2019, The San Diego Union-Tribune ### Sections ### AP Interview: Nessel blasts GOP-proposed cuts to her budget ### Paul Sancya / AP ### Associated Press ### MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. — ### Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said Republican-backed cuts to her budget would have a “devastating” impact, limiting the office’s ability to protect consumers, prosecute sexually abusive clergy and look into wrongful convictions. ### The general fund reductions proposed by the Senate and House range between 10% and 15%, or $4.2 million to $5.3 million, not including sizable cuts to what are known as restricted funds. They are seen as payback for some of the Democrat’s moves since taking office in January, like reaching a legal settlement to prohibit faith-based adoption agencies that contract with the state from discriminating against LGBT couples. ### “The proposed cuts would be devastating to the residents of our state,” Nessel told The Associated Press in an interview this past week at the Detroit Regional Chamber’s Mackinac Policy Conference. “It’s very short-sighted of the Legislature to think that cutting the budget of my office is in some way going to punish me personally for any of my views that I disagree with them on. The fact is it’s going to punish their constituents, and it’s going to be harmful to all our state residents.” ### She listed a number of a ways that the funding reductions would hurt, and she said lawmakers may not know that for every $1 allocated to the department, it can generate $10 or more. ### The consumer protection division this year has received more than $15 million in settlements that went to the state or to defrauded victims, Nessel said. Her office has intervened to scale back utility rate increases, saving customers. ### She is planning to file major lawsuits against companies over the opioid epidemic and drinking water contamination related to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. She has formed a task force to charge caregivers who abuse elders and vulnerable adults, and units to crack down on payroll and auto insurance fraud. A new wrongful conviction integrity unit will investigate inmates’ claims of innocence. ### “The savings, ultimately, to the taxpayers of our state or the restitution that taxpayers of our state see through our office is so enormous that the amount that you pay for those services is really a drop in the bucket,” Nessel said. ### She also noted that legislators have yet to appropriate $2 million that she and Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested in March for a multi-year investigation into Catholic priests. Nessel recently announced sexual assault charges against five men. ### Lawmakers authorized similar supplemental spending for large-scale probes of Flint’s water crisis and Michigan State University’s handling of complaints against former sports doctor Larry Nassar. ### “Not only do you have a situation where the Legislature has not deemed that investigation worthy of a nickel. But in drastically reducing our budget, it’s going to impact the investigation because all but two people on that case are volunteers,” she said. ### They work in the office and help with the clergy probe by volunteering their time during nights and weekends. ### “With this budget cut, we’re going to lose many of those staffers, too,” Nessel said. “It could be dozens and dozens of attorneys and investigators that we end up losing.” ### She said while a price cannot be put on one’s safety or security, the average cost per rape victim is $122,000 — including factors such as lost educational attainment, worker absenteeism, substance abuse addiction and suicide attempts. ### “You will have more victims out there, and you will not see justice potentially for so many victims that have already been abused,” Nessel said. “To use partisanship in that fashion I think is so disappointing and should disturb everybody in our state.” ### Republicans have been angered over Nessel’s legal opinions that said laws enacted in December’s lame-duck session are unconstitutional and her vow to not enforce a state abortion ban if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey said in an April radio interview that the Senate was applying “legislative pressure” on Nessel through the budget process. ### Asked about reducing the attorney general office’s budget, House Speaker Lee Chatfield told the AP at the business conference that the House plan — which is not finalized — has “many cuts because we are doing everything we can to ensure that we’re funding our roads, because that’s what the people want and that’s what the people deserve.” ### Budget negotiations will likely extend into the summer. The next fiscal year starts in October. ### “Everyone understands that this is process and this was step one in the process,” Chatfield said. ### ___ ### Follow Eggert on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

69599,"Larger text size ### Very large text size ### Luke Davies has known plenty of lows in his life, but right now the Sydney-raised, LA-based writer is in what he describes as ""absolutely a sweet spot"". ### His miniseries Catch-22 – starring, produced and directed (in part) by George Clooney – has just been released. His feature Angel of Mine will screen at the Melbourne International Film Festival in August. His adaptation of Paulette Jiles' exquisite novel News of the World is due to start shooting in September, with Tom Hanks in the lead and Paul Greengrass directing. ### He's written the script for Sherpa filmmaker Jennifer Peedom's Tenzing, about the 1953 assault on Everest by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. And he's just about to start work on an adaptation of The Most Dangerous Man in America, which is slated to star Woody Harrelson as an on-the-run Timothy Leary in the early 1970s. ### ""Yes, it's a nice sweet spot,"" the 57-year-old repeats. ""But this town is weird and crazy and ageist and intense. I don't take it for granted. I'm just enjoying the nice things at the moment, and I'm very focused. I've become very good at being a methodical, orderly, hard worker."" ### Advertisement ### Davies – who wrote the novel Candy and its screen adaptation based on his own story of drug addiction in the 1980s – has lived in Los Angeles since 2007, which is long enough to have experienced a lifetime's worth of promises and disappointments. Not to mention grinding poverty. ### ""I was so poor for so many years,"" he says. ""I couldn't get an agent, I couldn't get a meeting. It was really stressful. There was this period around 2010 when for nine months in a row I had to say to my housemate, Alex O'Loughlin [the Australian star of TV's Hawaii Five-0], ""I can't pay my rent again'. And every month he said, 'It's cool, it's cool, I've got it'."" ### Things began looking up for Davies when he won the $80,000 Prime Minister's Literary Award for Interferon Psalms, a book of poetry, in 2012. He paid his back rent, paid off the credit cards he'd been living off, and enjoyed the first bit of breathing room he'd had in years. ### Luke Davies, centre, and George Clooney, right, enjoy a lighter moment in a script reading on Catch-22. ### Credit:Philippe Antonello/Stan ### Then came Lion. His adaptation of Saroo Brierly's story about finding his birth mother in India thanks to Google Earth sparked a bidding war that ended with Harvey Weinstein reportedly paying $US12 million for the rights – based purely on the screenplay – in 2014. ### ""And then after all these years of not being able to get a meeting with even a junior exec, suddenly all the heads of the studios who had missed out in the bidding war said they wanted to meet this guy who made them cry. That's when things began to change."" ### When the film itself came out a couple of years later, there was a second wave. He'd jumped up and down with excitement upon reading News of the World, immediately sensing its screen potential. A month later, Tom Hanks and his production partners saw Lion, thought the same thing, and said, ""Let's talk to this guy"". ### But in Hollywood, even for someone with runs on the board, nothing is real until it's real. So it is that Catch-22 almost slipped through his fingers. ### Winning the $80,000 Prime Minister's Literary Award for poetry in 2012 was a lifeline for Davies. ### Credit:Alex Ellinghausen ### The series was developed by him and David Michôd, the writer-director of Animal Kingdom and another member of the ""Aussie sharehouse in Koreatown"" that Davies calls home (the fourth member is Mirrah Foulkes, partner of Michôd and the director of Judy & Punch, which screens at the Sydney Film Festival next week). ### Four weeks after they floated the idea to Scottish producer Richard Brown (True Detective) over coffee on their front porch, they had a deal to develop it as a series – with Davies writing and Michôd to direct all six episodes. But after many months of ""agonising"" development, Michôd dropped out when he realised he couldn't possibly do the series and his film The King. ### ""Which was super annoying for me for 30 seconds,"" admits Davies. ""It was like, 'Our show just fell apart'. He's my very dear friend, but it was like, 'Really?'"" ### But ""miraculously, somehow"" the script had made its way to George Clooney and his producing partner Grant Heslov, and two weeks later ""our show had very definitely not fallen apart"". ### Directors Grant Heslov, George Clooney, Ellen Kuras, star Christopher Abbott with Davies on set. ### Credit:Philippe Antonello/Stan ### When George Clooney is onboard your project, Davies discovered, doors really do open. All along, Paramount had said no to shooting in Italy – where much of the story is set – because it was too expensive. But Clooney has a house at Lake Como, ""and of course, three months later, we're shooting in Italy. I don't want to say it's causal, but…"" ### So, did George commute to work? ""He did, yeah,"" laughs Davies. ""Sometimes he would fly back to Lake Como on Friday night after shoots, and fly in again on Monday morning."" ### Now that's what you call a sweet spot. ### Catch-22 is now screening on Stan, which is owned by Nine, owner of this masthead.

The Melbourne International Film Festival runs August 1-18; details miff.com.au . ### Follow the author on Facebook at karlquinnjournalist and on twitter @karlkwin",60119,1,""" Which was super annoying for me for 30 seconds,"" admits Davies.

17900,"Fluoride Destroys Your Health in Obvious (And Stealthy) Ways ### 11 months ago ### Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Email ### Few people realize just how far-reaching the effects of long-term exposure to fluoride can be. ### Dental fluorosis may be the most obvious manifestation of fluoride damage as it discolors and pits people’s teeth, but much of the other harm it causes is not as easy to see and is often blamed on something else. Here’s a look at a few of the ways in which fluoride destroys your health . ### Cognitive and IQ problems ### Many people feel fluoridated water is a big reason for the general “dumbing down” of society we’ve seen in recent years. It makes sense when you consider that fluoride is a neurotoxin and 50 human studies have linked exposure to it with lower intelligence. ### It affects people of all ages, with fetal brain development also suffering from fluoride exposure. One study from Harvard Medical School linked elevated levels of fluoride to lowered IQs in children. Other studies have found that it can cause memory impairments and even brain damage. ### Higher risk of heart disease ### Because so much fluoride accumulates in the aorta, your heart can be affected by it significantly. Fluoride leads to oxidative stress and an inflammatory response, spurring atherosclerosis and heart damage. ### In addition, fluoride in ground water has been linked to high blood pressure and a higher risk of heart attack and stroke. ### Male infertility ### One of the less obvious effects of fluoride exposure is male infertility . Lots of people fail to connect their troubles conceiving to the chemical, even though more than 60 studies have shown that it can impact male reproduction by reducing the quantity and motility of sperm as well as testosterone levels. ### If you need further proof, consider the fact that American communities where the drinking water contains more than 3 ppm of fluoride had lower fertility rates than those areas with lower levels of fluoride in a study, even though the amount in question was within the limits of what the EPA considers “safe.” ### Weaker bones and skeletal fluorosis ### Here’s another reason to avoid fluoride: It’s been found in studies to weaken bones. Some studies have found that areas with 4 mg per liter of fluoride in the drinking water have higher rates of fractures and lower cortical bone density. Animal studies have also found bone strength reductions at the hands of exposure to fluoride. ### In addition, long-term exposure to fluoride has been found to cause skeletal fluorosis , which can lead to serious bone distortions and a “hunchback.” This is often misdiagnosed because it can look like other joint and bone diseases, like osteoarthritis. ### Cell DNA damage and cancer ### Fluoride causes genetic damage that can contribute to cancer. It’s been linked to lung and bladder cancers in particular, and some experts believe it can increase the risk of malignancies. ### In one study, boys who were exposed to fluoridated water as children were found to have a significantly higher chance of developing bone cancer as adolescents. ### Endocrine disruption ### Fluoride can impact your endocrine function , inhibiting the secretion of insulin, T3, T4 and other hormones. It also impacts melatonin, which is responsible for regulating your sleep and wake cycle. ### Gastrointestinal issues ### Ingesting even small amounts of fluoride can cause stomach lining damage and vomiting in some people. Poison Control Centers get thousands of calls each year about excessive fluoride ingestion by children in the form of toothpaste, which can cause nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. ### Fluoride can damage your health in many different ways. If you have fluoride in your water or your toothpaste , it’s time to start making some changes if you want to preserve your health.",60119,1,"If you need further proof, consider the fact that American communities where the drinking water contains more than 3 ppm of fluoride had lower fertility rates than those areas with lower levels of fluoride in a study, even though the amount in question was within the limits of what the EPA considers “safe. ”###Weaker bones and skeletal fluorosis###Here’s another reason to avoid fluoride: It’s been found in studies to weaken bones.

35002,"This Amazing Microalgae System Turns Pollution Into Oxygen (Video) ### Saturday, June 1, 2019 12:36 ### % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents. ###  ### by  N.Morgan ### The challenge of making oxygen out of resources readily available has been a goal of researchers for many years. A goal that has now been met by BiomiTech, who won the ultimate award in the innovation category at the Contamination Expo Series 2018 organized in Birmingham, England. ### The BioUrban 2.0 system uses microalgae to turn contaminants (carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide) in oxygen. ### The Mexican company is proud of the invention, and it’s 100% Mexican. Jaime Ferrer is the founding partner of BiomiTech had an interview with Milenio and used the opportunity to talk about the system. ### According to him, a single BioUrban system has the power to carry out the photosynthesis process and release oxygen equivalent to the oxygen released by 300 trees. Trees won’t be replaced, and the systems may be placed near roads and intersections. ### Ultra Curcumin ### The purification system is four meters high and it uses a steel casing. The apex is three-meter wide and has 500 liters of microalgae which is enough to filter up to 99.7% of the particles. Its shape resembles a tree. ### That’s not all. The system also has a sensor to monitor the quality of air. There’s wireless internet capability that transmits the data it collects. Waste microalgae can be used as a raw material in the production of biogas and biofuels. ### The first system was installed in Puebla in 2017. Hopefully, the invention will be installed throughout the country. The company won the Latam Edge Awards which supports the development of Latin American technology companies in the UK. ### The filtration system has the power to capture more than 13 million cubic meters of air. It releases oxygen equivalent to the oxygen released by 368 young eucalyptus trees within a year. ### We have an affiliate program designed for content creators and Affiliate marketers, who would like to sell this product, please  click here  for  affiliate program  details.

A stray shower or thunderstorm is possible. Low 63F. Winds light and variable. ### Updated: June 1, 2019 @ 9:52 am ### Make the Most of Your Camping Trip This Great Outdoors Month ### 9 hrs ago ### (StatePoint) Great Outdoors Month, celebrated in June, is the perfect opportunity for a camping expedition. ### Before packing up, consider the following ways to make the most of your trip. ### • Stargaze: Urban and suburban living can interfere with your stargazing potential. Take advantage of your remote location, away from clusters of light pollution to see the stars at their most vibrant. Check the weather in advance and try to pick a weekend with a good chance of clear skies. You may also want to bring along a telescope to help you pick out constellations, falling stars, planets and more. Remember, campsites are often densely forested, so before night falls, scope out a clearing where you can set up shop for optimal nighttime viewing. ### • Use tech support: Get equipped with technology that can support your outdoor adventure even when you are offline or out-of-range of mobile device radio wave transmissions. For example, Casio’s WSD-F30 Pro Trek Smart Outdoor Watch features a compass, as well as offline map usage capability, helping you navigate the trail. Map data downloading is handled through MapBox, a supplier of map data for countries worldwide. Featuring apps that support hiking, fishing, cycling and more, this water-resistant, durable watch will be a useful tool, no matter what activities your camping trip includes. ### • Think in extremes: When preparing to spend time outdoors in summer, you may not think much about strategies for staying warm, but many locations can get quite chilly at night. Since the bulk of the time you’ll be spending in your sleeping bag and tent is after the sun’s gone down and temperatures take a nose dive, it’s important to ensure these items are designed to keep you comfortable in the chilliest temperatures you expect to encounter. Likewise, you will probably do most of your hiking, kayaking and other active pastimes during the hotter parts of the day. Be sure you pack equipment and clothing for both of these extremes. ### • Get there early: Some sites have a first-come, first-served policy, making an early arrival a necessity. However, even if you reserve a site in advance, you’ll still want to make good time and get there before sunset. This can help ensure you get a good lay of the land so that you can pitch your tent on level ground that’s free of extraneous debris which will make sleeping uncomfortable. It’s also a good way to ensure you get all your items unpacked and organized so you know where everything is. Finally, if you only have a couple nights to camp, you don’t want to miss even one spectacular sunset stuck in traffic. ### With a few strategies and tools, you can make Great Outdoors Month the greatest yet. ### *****",60119,1,"(22192)###Today###Mainly sunny to start, then a few afternoon clouds.

Its actually is pretty neat. ### Reply ### 2 points · 19 days ago ### Oh god I have so many.. My family actually jokes that a ghost follows me. Basically every house ive lived werid things happen. ### First one, when I was about 5 years old. My grandfather suddenly passed away. We moved into his house. I dont remember personally but I would tell my parents I seen my grandpa in the house. This was before I even understood what I was truly saying. ### Same house, around age 7. Ill never forget this. It was bedtime, I just got done brushing my teeth. My mom and younger brother told me goodnight and turned my lights off. A few mins later something slid under my bed. It was dark, I didnt see exact details, it was daek. I figured it was my little brother messing with me, which was common. I said ""I seen you, get out here"".. I get up, flick the light on and look under the bed to find NOTHING. NOTHING was under there... My mom and brother were already downstairs to bed. ### Another time, I had a dream. I was inside the house. Looking out the window into the backyard. I see me as a little girl running playing with my dog. Then me as the little girl in the yard looks up at the window. I person in the house, ducked back so I couldnt be seen. Not really paranormal and I often have werid dreams. This one always stuck with me tho. Probably cause in this house I always felt like someone was watching me. ### My parents were getting divorced. My dad left the house until everything was finalized.. The house was originally his fathers... anyways one of the final days being there. I was downstairs in my parents room. I was writing and my pen stopped working. There was an old desk where we kept pens. The drawer was stuck. I kept tugging on it. Then from behind me, someone said ""hey"" and the draw finally gave. I ran so fast. The voice sounded like it came right behind me. At the time I was the only one in the house. Didnt go back down there for a very long time. Never alone. ### My mom ended up buying a house. Which I lived with her. As a teen my bedroom light would flicker and do weird things. I always tried to comfort myself and say it was the electrical.. My brother later took the room when I moved out. Hes never had a problem. ### Another time at my moms house, me and my boyfriend were staying while my mom was out of town. Her dog kept pacing in and out of my brothers room. Normally he slept in his kennel. It was kinda annoying me. I got up and shut my brothers door to stop him. At the time my son was still pretty young. In the AM my son was compleletly turned around in his crib. He was at the age where he couldn't do that or atleast never did.. which was odd but whatever. Then I went into the hallway. My brothers door was cracked open.. A poster hanging down I didnt notice before.. I further inspected. This poster was made of thicker cardboard material.. This poster was tacked into the wooden door frame moulding inside the room. If the door shut, it would have bent and ruined the poster. Later on my brother confirmed that poster was on the otherside of his room tacked into the wall level with the other posters. My boyfriend swears he didnt do it, I forsure didnt do it. ### Another time we were house sitting for my mom. Me and my boyfriend were arguing all night. It got to the point of screaming at eachother which was not normal for us at all. Eventually we both were kinda like why are we even fighting lets stop and go to bed.. As we are laying there quiet. A deep loud evil dont even know how to describe it, Something out of a horror movie roar.. I asked him ""Did u hear that."" He was like ""what the fuck""  We both hopped up so fast. Packed our stuff, even took the dog and left. ### When I moved out of moms house, I bought this older trailer. For the first year it was just dumbthings. Stuff would disappear and reappear other places. Once a purse stored away in a tote, with multiple totes on top, in a closet.. This purse ended up in the middle of my hallway. I was drunk when I found it. Soo that was a real mindfuk there. ### Another time I got off work. I was walking down the hall to my bedroom and my doorknob turned. I seen and heard it. I was on the phone with my mom when it happened. At first I thought someone broke in and was in my room. Obviously it was no one. ### We rented a house for alittle, my son always talked about the 'black man'. He said the house was really the black mans, but he lets us live there.. A few times I seen shadows out of the corner of my eye. Nothing serious though. ### Now my current house once I was laying in bed and Netflix hit me with the ""Are you still watching"". I was scrolling facebook. I thought to myself, I better turn this back on before I hear something. I have an old house, it creaks and settles. Not what I want to hear at 3am after watching murder detective shows lol.. Well awhile later I heard a small high pitch voice say ""hi"" from my closet. It sounded like it came from a toy doll. I promise you my son has no toy that sounds like that. No toys in my closet period. After that ive had uneasy feelings about my closet then a minute later it will open! It doesn't have a tight latch but dont open often.. ### One time me and a friend were driving around, just talking, listening to music. We drove to more of a country area. It got dark, so we were heading back.. A werid light ball thing?. Went straight down then went up but the movement was odd. I dont remember the exact details now. We both seen it. Both agreed it wasnt normal and didnt wanna talk about it. ### I havent been to bed yet and dont feel like proof reading all this. Sorry for any spelling errors or poor sentence forming lol.. ### Reply ### 1 point · 23 days ago ### Actually lastnight! I was me but I was older. I was standing in a hallway. I knew it wasnt my hallway but can't recall whos. I knew I wasnt alone in the house but didn't see anyone. I could see into their living room. The walls were an odd orange color. The room was almost like a 60s vibe, weird shaped mirror, a cluster of random shit on the wall. As I was standing in the hallway I realized I was fcked up on something.. I wasn't scared, actually in my dream state it was a ""familiar"" feeling. Then I got that werid deja vu feeling. I knew something bad was about to happen & then I wokeup... ### Reply ### 1 point · 23 days ago ### My bf use to get sleep paralysis everynight. Sometimes he would see stuff others he would just be stuck. I would beable to tell because his breathing would get rapid or he would whimper (which he was trying to scream).. The scariest one he told me about, he was stuck laying on the bed. The door slowly  opens... Then walked in a buff creature, a man with a bullhead. (later after googling we discovered its a minotaur?) He couldn't move.. The creature charged at him, which caused him to literally jump out of his sleep.. ### Reply",60119,1,"2 points · 19 days ago###Oh god I have so many..

They remain determined to keep the memories alive even as China's rulers seek to sandblast the protests and the military's bloody crackdown from history. ### ""Sometimes remembrance is one of the most humble forms of resistance,"" Wu'er Kaixi said in an interview in Taiwan, where he now lives with his wife and children. ### While Wu'er Kaixi, 51, escaped abroad after the June 4 crackdown after finding himself at No. 2 on the government's most-wanted list, then-graduate student Pu Zhiqiang remained in China despite his role in the protests as a high-profile advocate of speech and press freedoms. Looking at old photos of his younger self, Pu reflects on the motivations of the protesters that were mostly pure, if somewhat naive. ### ""We hoped that China could change for the better,"" said Pu, 54. ""As a 24-year-old, presented with this chance to serve society, had I not played a role at all, not made my voice heard, I would not have been able to forgive myself."" ### The military crackdown, in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died, put an end to more than seven weeks of student-led protests in 1989 calling for an end to corruption and for a more open and fair society. ### While many who took part wonder what could have been done differently to avoid the bloodshed, Feng Congde, a graduate student that year at elite Peking University, is convinced the students didn't push hard enough. ### The experience of 1989 was ""both positive and negative,"" Feng said. ""But we have to learn the lesson, that even though we had these large numbers of people on the street, we didn't know what we should do. We should have asked the military to overthrow the regime."" ### Feng maintains that now, as back then, the regime remains resistant to reforming itself in the way that Taiwan's Nationalists evolved from an authoritarian police state into a multiparty democracy, eventually handing over power to the opposition through elections. Like many in the democratic movement, Feng idolizes Chiang Ching-kuo, the son and successor of Chiang Kai-shek, who began the process of Taiwan's democratization during the 1980s. ### ""I'm quite optimistic about the democratic future of China, but I have very little hope that (President and Communist Party leader) Xi Jinping can learn from Chiang Ching-kuo. I think the totalitarian (Communist Party) regime is totally different from an authoritarian regime like the (Nationalists),"" Feng said. ### While few echo Feng's ruing of the lost chance of a military coup, hostility toward the regime and frustration with perceived foreign gullibility are near constants among members of the movement who remain active, especially those based abroad. Their impressions appear permanently colored by the shock, horror and disbelief they felt when the People's Liberation Army opened fire on the people they'd been charged with protecting and who'd grown to trust and revere them. ### Wang Dan, 50, who was imprisoned after being named No. 1 on the most-wanted list, is among those who doesn't mince words. ### ""It is time for us now, for the whole democratic countries now, to re-recognize the true face of the (Communist Party) and try to learn some lessons from the Tiananmen massacre,"" Wang said, using another term for the crackdown of June 3-4. ""This is a very important challenge for the whole world, because now China is a rising power, and seems like a threat for the democracy and freedom of the whole world."" ### Wu'er Kaixi is similarly scathing, deriding the regime's claims to patriotic zeal as a cover for their desire to maintain their wealth and privileges at any cost. ### ""Let's look at what the Chinese regime is clearly. It's a group of people who stole the position of ruling China, one of the largest counties in the world and they're taking advantage of that position to do one thing: loot,"" he said. ### Pu, a lawyer who was disbarred for his political activism, bemoans 1989 and the years since as a lost opportunity to develop a new, possibly alternative, political class. ### Tiananmen ""was an excellent training opportunity for taking part in society, taking part in politics for young people of my generation,"" Pu said. ""But the distinctive characteristic of Chinese politics — this long-term totalitarianism — is that it cannot permit a political force or political party to take organized action."" ### Things have grown only more difficult amid tightening social controls, making it much harder to rally forces in society to do things ""either good or bad,"" Pu said. ### Yet Wu'er Kaixi, now the honorary chairman of Reporters Without Borders at its East Asia office in Taipei, says those actions — the increasing repression borne out in policies such as the internment of 1 million or more Chinese Muslims in re-education camps — provide a constant reminder of the unchanged nature of the regime. ### ""The reason people still remember (1989), other than the mere importance of it, is also because the Communist Party is still conducting all of these brutal acts and atrocities within China against Uighur people, against Tibetans, Hong Kong, Macau, and even conducting threats against neighboring countries like Taiwan,"" he said. ### ""That will remind people that this regime, today's acts of this regime, is the same regime that massacred peaceful demonstrators 30 years ago,"" he said. ### Feng, who is studying acupuncture and administers pro-democracy websites, and Wu'er Kaixi say their continued zeal for the cause is bolstered by a sense of obligation to those who fell in 1989, to see their names rehabilitated and their goal of a democratic China achieve fruition. ### ""So I have to live with this survivor's guilt ... but I will try to make the dream of those who fell 30 years ago come true sooner,"" Wu'er Kaixi said. ### Pu, who continues to work as a legal adviser, said he sees his generation as a link to the past. Veterans, those around 50, are now the ""backbone of society"" who are obligated to pass on their experiences and ideals to a younger generation. ### Apart from the leaders, who to varying degrees have had some say in how they have lived their lives since, Tiananmen left many scarred for life or saddled with criminal records that have severely restricted their choices. ### Since serving a 17-year sentence for allegedly attacking martial law troops — a charge he denies — Dong Shengkun has been unable to find a steady job and is forced to live with his elderly mother while receiving the government's minimum living allowance of 1,000 yuan ($145) per month.

The tank standoff, memorialized by several photographers including Jeff Widener of The Associated Press , has become a symbol of defiance around the world. ### Hundreds of people walked by the installation Saturday morning. Many took selfies and photos of the artwork, which has been up for a few weeks. ### While public remembrances of the Tiananmen protests are strictly forbidden in mainland China, there are regular commemorations in democratically governed Taiwan and Hong Kong, China's semi-autonomous southern region. Next Tuesday marks 30 years since the protests, led by students who were joined by individuals from all walks of life, calling for political reform. ### China's ruling Communist Party punishes citizens who dare to speak publicly about the event. While an untold number of people inside China are even unaware of this historic event, others have learned about it through smuggled DVDs and private conversations as well as using software to scale the internet firewall. ### Mikel Zhang, a lawyer from Shanghai who visited the ""Tank Man"" installation Saturday morning, said that the students' beliefs were different than those of the government. ""But eventually ... blood was shed,"" he said. ### An inscription for the artwork says Taiwan stands with the people who have never ceased to resist the ""gigantic autocracy."" ### Taiwan split from mainland China amid civil war in 1949, though Beijing still claims the island as part of its territory.",60119,1,"Tourists walk past an inflatable tank man at the Liberty Square of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei, Taiwan, Saturday, June 1, 2019.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) - ### William Byron drives down the front stretch during qualifying for Sunday's NASCAR Cup Series auto race at Pocono Raceway, Saturday, June 1, 2019, in Long Pond, Pa. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) - ### LONG POND — William Byron turned the fast lap at Pocono in the latest sign that Hendrick Motorsports may have turned the corner and can stamp itself a NASCAR championship contender. ### Hendrick Motorsports was long the home of Hall of Famers and champions, from Jeff Gordon to Jimmie Johnson, and was always a threat to place a driver in the championship race. Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr. retired, and Johnson’s seven reigns as Cup Series champion at times seem like a distant memory as he’s stuck on a winless streak that stretches two years. ### The organization with 12 Cup titles was locked out of the championship-deciding finale in 2018 for the second consecutive year. ### Hendrick is on the brink of a breakthrough. ### Byron turned a lap of 173.494 mph on Saturday to win the pole at Pocono Raceway. He won his second straight pole in the No. 24 Chevrolet, following up his first-place start last week at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Byron opened the season with a pole in the Daytona 500 but has yet to win a Cup race in 49 career starts. ### “It just improves your ability in the race to control your race,” Byron said of the pole. “We made some good improvements overnight for sure, and that showed in qualifying. Really, I think that’s going to translate to the race.” ### Byron was one of four Hendrick Motorsports drivers to finish in the top 10 last week in the Coca-Cola 600. Chase Elliott is the only Hendrick driver with a win this season. Hendrick’s Alex Bowman was runner-up in three straight races before finishing seventh last week. The 43-year-old Johnson has two straight top 10s and his drive to pass Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt and set a NASCAR record with eight championships remains as strong as ever. ### Elliott may reign as NASCAR’s most popular driver but he’s not ready to supplant Johnson as The Man at Hendrick. ### “As long as Jimmie’s there, Jimmie’s always going to be that guy,” Elliott said. “I’ve won less races than he has championships. I think as long as he’s in the organization, he’s always going to be our leader. I respect that, as everybody else should, too.” ### Joe Gibbs Racing remains the class of NASCAR with eight wins this season and Team Penske drivers have four wins. No other organization has won a Cup race this season. ### Elliott has four-straight top-10 finishes at Pocono and Johnson has three wins on the 2½-mile track. Hendrick has 17 career wins at Pocono but none since Earnhardt swept the two races in 2014. ### Byron hopes starting first leads to his first win in the Cup Series. ### “Last year was just a dog fight to try and run well,” Byron said. ### Other items of note at Pocono: ### THE LINEUP ### Kyle Busch joins Byron in the front row in the No. 18 Toyota. Clint Bowyer starts third, followed by Erik Jones and Brad Keselowski. ### The cars for Chris Buescher and Erik Jones failed pre-qualifying inspection twice and had their car chiefs ejected. ### BUSCH BLASTS ### Kyle Busch’s list of complaints keeps getting longer. ### Busch has vented all season about NASCAR’s new race package that some drivers say make passing hopeless for long stretches of the race. ### “When you’re not out front leading laps and your back in traffic, it’s hard to pass. It’s a struggle,” Busch said. “It’s harder now than it’s been in a long, long time to pass guys and get yourself to the front and pass the leader for the lead in green flag situations.” ### Busch also put his Kyle Busch Motorsports drivers in the Truck Series on blast for not producing. ### Busch gave the program a 2 out of 10 on a season scale. The boss is hot. His drivers are not. ### Todd Gilliland is winless in eight races in the No. 4 Toyota and Harrison Burton is winless in eight races in the No. 18 Toyota. ### Busch has five wins in five races in the No. 51 Toyota. ### “They ain’t doing (well), man,” Busch said. “They ain’t running good. I can go out there and win every single race by 10 seconds and they’re out struggling along to finish seventh to 10? That ain’t gonna fly.” ### He said there could be changes in the lineup. ### BUBBA’S BLUES ### Bubba Wallace, who signed a sponsorship deal this week with St. Louis-area company World Wide Technology , was headed to St. Louis for Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final between the Blues and the Boston Bruins on Saturday night. ### “I don’t know what the hell I’m watching,” Wallace said. “Go Blues.” ### William Byron poses poses with the pole award after qualifying first for Sunday’s NASCAR Cup Series auto race at Pocono Raceway, Saturday, June 1, 2019, in Long Pond, Pa.

The measure passed the Illinois Democratic-led Senate late Friday with a 34-20 vote. Only one Democrat voted against the bill, and Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker has said he will sign the legislation. ### Related Content ### Court to decide whether abortion services in Missouri will end on Friday ### Under the bill, pregnant women have the ""fundamental right"" to have an abortion and a ""fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent rights."" ### It repeals the Illinois Abortion Law of 1975, which penalized doctors for performing the procedure, and the state's ban on partial-birth abortions. The bill also provides insurance requirements to cover abortion procedures. ### ""As states across the country pass dangerous laws restricting access to abortion, we in Illinois are standing with women and guaranteeing access to reproductive health care,"" Democratic state Sen. Melinda Bush , one of the bill's sponsors, said in a statement. ### Bush said there's a ""real possibility"" that in the coming years the Supreme Court could overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Her bill, she said, ""guarantees that women in Illinois have the right to make decisions about their bodies, regardless of what happens at the federal level."" ### The bill will immediately take effect once the governor signs it into law. ### ""Today was a major step forward for every woman in this state and I look forward continuing my work as an ally by signing the Reproductive Healthcare Act into law,"" Pritzker wrote in tweet on Tuesday. ### In Nevada on Friday, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak signed the ""Trust Nevada Women Act,"" Senate Bill 179, which removes long-standing criminal penalties for abortion and requirements for medical providers. ### ""Nevada has a long history of trusting the women of our state to make their own reproductive health care decisions and protecting the right to reproductive freedom,"" Sisolak said at the bill signing ceremony. ### The new law decriminalizes certain actions related to performing abortions, abortion drugs and abortion prosecution. It rewrites existing state abortion laws that require physicians to notify a pregnant woman about the ""emotional implications"" of an abortion, instead requiring doctors ""describe the nature and consequences of the procedure."" ### Physicians in the state would also no longer have to certify in writing a pregnant woman's marital status and age before performing an abortion as previous laws required. ### ""In light of increasing attacks at the federal level and in other states such as Georgia, Alabama, Missouri, and Louisiana, SB179 reaffirms Nevada's commitment to protecting reproductive freedom and access to reproductive health care,"" Sisolak said Friday. ### He continued, ""I have been disappointed by the recent uptick in efforts in other states to restrict women's right to choose, and I am especially proud today to be a Nevadan, where we protect a woman's right to make her own decisions about her own body."" ### Sisolak also signed Senate Bill 94, which allocates $6 million in funding for statewide family planning grants. ### CNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report. ### The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

""And because music was so much a part of his life, he felt the need to contribute somehow."" ### Before his death in March at age 77, Joel became the impetus behind the Northeast Iowa School of Music's Healing Harmonies Chorus, an ensemble with an eye toward providing an outlet for non-care-center Alzheimer's disease patients in the tri-states, along with their caregivers. ### Thanks to Tracey Rush, Northeast Iowa School of Music founder, a part of Joel remains with the ensemble, which recently began its weekly rehearsals. ### In 2018, after Gorun had approached Rush with the idea for the group, Rush had been selected in a competitive process to participate in the National Guild's Catalyzing Creative Aging program, an initiative designed to support new creative aging programs at nonprofit arts education organizations nationwide. ### Through that support, Rush was able to help see Joel's dream through. ### ""Joel loved to sing, and he wanted to keep singing,"" Rush said. ""Something like this was just on his heart. And there can be limited creative outlets for people going through dementia and even for people in that 65 and older group."" ### The Healing Harmonies Chorus is a fitting ensemble for the Northeast Iowa School of Music, joining the roster alongside the New Horizons Band for those 50 and older. Rounding that out are music groups dedicated to youth, as well as the women's ensemble Sweet Adelines International and the Dubuque Community String Orchestra. ### ""When I started the school 18 years ago, I did it with the idea of music for all,"" Rush said. ""It's not just for kids. It's not just for adults. It's also for people with needs. It might not be therapy, but it can be therapeutic."" ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### Healing Harmonies is led by Callie Mescher, a certified neurologic music therapist and piano and voice teacher in the Dubuque area. She specializes in working with those with disabilities, as well as those dealing with memory loss. ### ""This group isn't just about singing but about building relationships,"" said Mescher, who slowly warms the group up before working with them on good breath support, loosening their jaws, counting out rhythms and making music out of the small dots sitting upon staves on the page. ""And that's really what music is about as well."" ### The group sings memory-infused melodies such as ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" as well as patriotic tunes in preparation for an upcoming Fourth of July concert. ### ""Memory loss is a scary thing,"" Mescher said. ""There is no predicting it. So to see people picking up old melodies they knew and having an exposure to something creative, it just shows how powerful the mind and music are. A outlet like this is very exciting for our community."" ### Subscribe to Breaking News ### Sign up!  ### The group currently fluctuates between six and nine people. Among them are former music teachers, as well as those who have never sung or played an instrument. ### Front and center is Marilyn, who admitted that it's difficult to be there without Joel singing alongside her. Yet, she's comforted in experiencing how his dream is benefiting others. ### ""My voice isn't anywhere near what Joel's was, but I'm enjoying getting back into singing,"" she said. ""And it's a way for me to keep connected to Joel."" ### Marilyn also is eager to see the group continue to grow as more people become familiar with it as a community offering. Those interested are encouraged to sign up, with a caregiver. ### ""There is one gentleman who has been in music for a long time, so it's rewarding to see that at this stage of his life, it's still something that he can enjoy,"" she said. ""Joel would have loved to have sung with this group. We owe a lot to Tracey and the Northeast Iowa School of Music. Without them, this might have died with Joel."" ### ———",60119,1,"In 2018, after Gorun had approached Rush with the idea for the group, Rush had been selected in a competitive process to participate in the National Guild's Catalyzing Creative Aging program, an initiative designed to support new creative aging programs at nonprofit arts education organizations nationwide.###Through that support, Rush was able to help see Joel's dream through.###"" Joel loved to sing, and he wanted to keep singing,"" Rush said.

How to post up on a basketball court. How to hold a shot or a discus in his hand and generate the momentum to heave it as far as possible. Most of all, Glen taught Garrett how to play football fast and fearless, so well that Garrett was one of the state’s best players, leading his team — Glen’s team — to a state title. ### “It’s all I’ve ever really known, him coaching me,” Garrett said Tuesday. ### The two have one more week together at the Shrine Bowl — Glen coaching Garrett, who will play inside linebacker at Nebraska, but played just about anywhere on the field at York High School, where he was a prep star. It’s a bit of surprise that Garrett will play in Saturday’s game, because Husker scholarship players have rarely appeared in the event over the past decade.  ### NU walk-ons — many of whom have already started workouts in Lincoln — dot the North and South rosters. Garrett has started workouts, too. He also has nothing to prove in a game like the Shrine Bowl. ### But this is one more week with Dad, and Nebraska coach Scott Frost — himself a veteran of the Shrine Bowl — didn’t merely allow Garrett to play in the Shrine Bowl. He encouraged it. ### “We were sitting in Coach Frost’s office, and he said, ‘Your dad’s coaching in this game? You darn well better play,’ ” Glen Snodgrass said. ### And it’s a dream the 6-foot-3, 215-pound Garrett has had for more than a decade, since Glen was a head coach in the Eight-Man All-Star football game in 2007. Garrett was the ball boy that week. He had fun; he even met another 2019 Shrine Bowl participant, McCook’s DJ Gross, at the event, as well. ### “I’d always wondered growing up if I was good enough to play in it,” Garrett said. “It was kind of a motivation for me.” ### His career at York made him a slam-dunk pick. Last season, he accounted for 40 touchdowns — 17 passing and 23 rushing — while playing linebacker on defense. In 2017, he had an equally extraordinary season, amassing 1,542 yards rushing, 692 passing and 426 receiving while racking up 86 tackles at linebacker. York finished 12-1 and won a state title, which led to the best 15 minutes of Glen’s coaching career with Garrett. ### First, he got to put a Class B gold medal around Garrett’s neck after the state title victory. It reminded Glen of his first state title at Overton in 2006, when Garrett was up on the stage with him as he put medals around his players’ necks. ### About 10 minutes after the medal ceremony, Glen found Garrett and took him out to the middle of Memorial Stadium. There, he told Garrett he’d received a full-ride scholarship offer from Nebraska coach Mike Riley, who was fired five days later. Riley had told Glen the morning before the game. Glen wanted Garrett to focus on the game, not the offer, until after the medal was on his chest. ### At the 50-yard line, Garrett broke down with joy. ### “I just don’t know if it can get much better than that,” Glen said. “It was pretty incredible. He’s not a real emotional kid but was absolutely overcome with emotion in that moment.” ### Eighteen months later, father and son are at the end of the coach/player part of their relationship. Glen becomes a full-time fan of Garrett’s now. He’s already a big backer of Garrett’s new position coach, Barrett Ruud. ### “He’s obviously a tough, very, very intelligent coach who connects with his players very, very well,” Glen said. “The thing I’ve always noticed is he’s very, very humble and down to earth. When you have the things on his résumé that he does, it’s hard to be humble, but he really is, so every time he tells me something I trust it, because I know the kind of coach he is.” ### Garrett loved his first week on campus, working out, learning from guys such as Mohamed Barry and Damian Jackson. His mind is filled with possibilities, especially at inside linebacker, where NU has just two fully healthy scholarship veterans — Barry and Collin Miller. Garrett has a chance to play early, especially on special teams. ### He wants one more football game with Dad, though. ### “We’ll give each other a hug,” Garrett said. “And I’ll tell him thank you. It’s just another football game, I guess. We’ve come a long way, and it’s been a heck of a ride. I’ll miss it.” ### Close ### Chris Septak, 2000, Millard West ### JEFF BEIERMANN/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Ira Cooper, 2000, Omaha Westside ### MATT MILLER/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Lornell McPherson, 2000, Omaha Central ### JEFF BEIERMANN/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Steve Kriewald, 2000, North Loup Scotia ### JEFF BEIERMANN/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Barrett Ruud, 2001, Lincoln Southeast ### KILEY CRUSE/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Mike McLaughlin, 2001, Millard North ### LAURA INNS/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Titus Adams, 2001, Omaha Creighton Prep ### KILEY CRUSE/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Dane Todd, 2002, Lincoln Southeast ### MATT MILLER/THE WORLD-HERALD ### David Horne, 2002, Omaha Central ### JEFF BEIERMANN/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Kurt Mann, 2002, Grand Island ### JEFF BUNDY/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Mark LeFlore, 2002, Omaha Central ### MATT MILLER/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Andy Birkel, 2003, Lincoln Southeast ### JEFF BUNDY/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Bo Ruud, 2003, Lincoln Southeast ### THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ### Brandon Teamer, 2003, Omaha Central ### JEFF BUNDY/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Tierre Green, 2003, Omaha Benson ### MATT MILLER/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Cortney Grixby, 2004, Omaha Central ### JEFF BEIERMANN/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Ty Steinkuhler, 2004, Lincoln Southwest ### MATT MILLER/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Jeff Souder, 2005, Bellevue West ### Jeff Beiermann ### Robert Rands, 2005, Bellevue East ### MATT MILLER/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Zach Potter, 2005, Omaha Creighton Prep ### MATT MILLER/THE WORLD-HERALD ### Ben Martin, 2006, Lincoln Southwest ### NEBRASKA ATHLETICS ### Corey Young, 2006, Millard North ### JAMES R.

69593,"BASEBALL: Venice edges Doral Academy 3-2 to win Class 7A state championship ###  ### Amazing Indians go back-to-back and collect sixth title in program history ### FORT MYERS ### While some of the names and faces have changed, the lopsided loss suffered by the Doral Academy baseball team to Venice in last year’s state semifinals certainly resonated fresh in the minds of the returning Firebirds. ### What better way than to gain a measure of revenge a year later than by beating the Indians in the state final? ### Not this year. ### In typical fashion and much to the delight of another huge Venice gathering, the never-say-die Indians rallied for three runs in the sixth inning and hung on for a 3-2 victory over the Firebirds in the Class 7A state championship game Saturday night at Hammond Stadium at the CenturyLink Sports Complex, spring home of the Minnesota Twins. ### “There was no doubt that was their cry,” Venice coach Craig Faulkner said of Doral Academy. “Listen, they were a lot better team this year than they were last year. They were ready for us, but we were prepared too. We didn’t slack off this year at all. If anything we worked harder.” ### It was the sixth state title in Indians’ program history and the second time Venice has gone back-to-back. The defending state champions also won consecutive titles in 2012-13 to go along with championships in 2007 and 2015. ### “They all feel great, no doubt about it,” Faulkner said. “I love these guys. They are a pretty special group of young men. They’ve worked hard like everyone does, but harder than everyone. They never stop.

Key West and Miami Westminster Christian have won 11 to lead the way. ### “It means we get another ring,” Venice starting pitcher senior Danny Rodriguez said. ### Trailing 2-0 entering the sixth inning, the Indians (26-6) erupted for three runs. Kevin Dubrule opened with an infield single and went to second on a balk. With one out, Zac Calhoon, who had four hits in Friday's state semifinal win, pulled a double to right to crack the goose egg on the scoreboard. ### Chasn Rockymore singled to right to place runners on the corners. Venice pulled its old trick out of the bag, as Reegan Jackowiak dropped a safety squeeze bunt to plate Calhoon. ### “Like I said yesterday, I had to stay calm and make sure the bunt was down and that I touched the base,” Calhoon said. “The bunt was not in the air. As soon as I saw that, I went. Great job by Reegan to get that down.” ### With two outs, freshman Marek Houston came up with another clutch hit, a run-scoring single to left to snap the 2-all tie. ### “The bottom of our order has been great all year, especially later in the season,” Faulkner said. “It’s definitely a team effort. ### “To come back from a two-run deficit.

The senior right-hander allowed four hits and two runs with 10 strikeouts and two walks. ### “Danny really grinded today,” Calhoon said. “This team was a really good hitting team. We had to pitch backwards to them. His slider was really on, and he executed real well.” ### “I felt Clay was ready to come, ready to go,” Faulkner said. “He showed that.” ### Clay Callan, who threw the maximum 30 pitches Friday to be eligible for Saturday, hit the first batter he faced. ### With runners on first and second and none out, the side-winding right-hander got a fly ball, strikeout and a ground out to get out of the jam. ### In the seventh, Callan got two strikeouts and a fly ball to Rodriguez, who moved to right field. ### The Firebirds (27-7) got on the board first with a run in the third inning, but it could have been much worse for Venice. ### A single and double placed runners on second and third with none out. Rodriguez got a pop out to second, and third baseman Jackowiak gunned down a runner at the plate. Figueroa hit a low liner to left where Calhoon made an all-out diving effort but the ball fell in front of him to produce a run. Rodriguez got a strikeout to end the threat. ### Doral Academy doubled its lead when Xavier Moronta led off the fourth with a no-doubt home run to right field, his fifth of the season. ### “After I gave up the home run I knew I had to settle down and throw strikes so my team could come back and try to get some hits and some runs on the board,” Rodriguez said. ### And they did. ### “It was awesome,” Rodriguez said. “We did it (Friday) in a long game in the hot heat and coming back against them.

The deadline has now been extended by a fortnight. ### Traders have said the board should first make arrangements for 250 of them to function and then ask them to leave. “The infrastructure with which we are working is in a pathetic condition. Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation had declared it dilapidated in 2003 and since 2005, we have been demanding rehabilitation for the market, but nothing has been done yet. Every June, as a formality, NMMC sends us a notice saying the structure is dilapidated but nobody has an answer as to where we should go,” said Ashok Walvi, an onion and potato trader and Director of the Maharshtra Rajya Bazar Samiti Mahasangh. ### On March 22, APMC authorities sent an eviction notice to the traders. “During recent bridge collapses in Mumbai, government authorities were held responsible. Now the APMC authorities are afraid that if anything untoward happens here, they will be held responsible. Hence, as a formality, they sent an eviction notice. Then we approached court to stay the eviction. The court will decide the matter after June 6 when it reopens. Hence, we requested the authorities to give us an extension, which they did,” Mr. Walvi said. ### Of the nearly 250 traders in the market, 234 have received the notice. “Every monsoon, there are incidents of slab collapse in the galas (outlets). It’s becoming difficult to work here but we do not have an option,” said a trader. ### The market is spread across 15 acres, and has seven buildings. “The authorities had given an option of shifting to a two-acre plot that belongs to MAFCO market. We are already finding it difficult to work on 15 acres; working from a two-acre plot is impossible,” Mr. Walvi said. The traders have been demanding infrastructure and not just land, to shift the work. With around 300 trucks entering the market, they have asked authorities to allot space accordingly. ### “We have extended the date for eviction as per the traders’ request. They have rejected the land at MAFCO market. We asked CIDCO too for land, but they do not have it. At the moment, we do not have any substitute to offer the traders,” said Anil Chavan, APMC Secretary. ### Related Topics",60119,1,"Traders have said the board should first make arrangements for 250 of them to function and then ask them to leave. “ The infrastructure with which we are working is in a pathetic condition.

It originally was pegged to run through July 7. ### Producer Scott Rudin announced the pending final curtain today. ### Two-time Oscar winner Jackson starred as Shakespeare’s famous king of England who divides his realm among his three daughters and their spouses. She won an Olivier Award for the role when it played London’s West End in 2016, but this was an entirely new production. The Broadway cast also includes Jayne Houdyshell, Elizabeth Marvel, Aisling O’Sullivan, Pedro Pascal, John Douglas Thompson and Ruth Wilson, who is up for a Featured Actress Tony Award next month for her role as Cordelia. ### In his review of the show , Deadline’s Greg Evans enthused: “So ferocious, so sinewy is [Jackson’s] take on Shakespeare’s lion in winter that those famously spoiled daughters and their menfolk would seem wise to send their regrets and just not show up to any family reunions. Lucky for us, they give as good as they get.” ### Directed by Tony winner Sam Gold, King Lear began previews on February 28 and the show opened April 4 at the Cort Theatre, running for 76 regular performances.

17540,"POLITICO ### Stephanie Murray's must-read rundown of what's up on Beacon Hill and beyond.  You can unsubscribe at any time. ### Presented by JUUL Labs ### GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS. ### KHAN GOES AFTER ALTERED ADS — State Rep. Kay Khan is pushing for legislation that would give up to a $10,000 tax credit to certain companies that don't digitally alter the skin tone or body shape of models used in advertising. The recently filed bill is the first of its kind in the country, according to Khan's office, and she says it could convince companies to ""lean into the body confidence movement."" ### ""It would be trying to incentivize companies to be more realistic in their way of advertising,"" Khan told me last night. ""It's not that we see images just once or twice. We see these manipulated images hundreds of times, and that's what kind of stays with us. So the idea would be to create a better environment that would promote more healthy images."" ### The bill would give a tax credit to cosmetic, personal care and apparel companies that don't use edited advertisements. The proposed law defines those edits as when a ""human model’s skin tone, skin texture including wrinkles, body size, or body shape are changed."" Khan said the bill was brought to her attention last year when she met with a representative from Israel. Lawmakers there passed a law in 2012 to regulate the use of digitally altered images in advertising. ### Experts say that regular exposure to digitally altered images of models can trigger mental health issues in young people, including eating disorders. And Khan's bill comes as some brands have rejected using digitally altered images in ad campaigns. Women's retailer Aerie stopped editing photos of models in 2014, and Target announced it would not alter images of models in its swimwear campaign s last year. ### Khan pointed to a program launched by CVS, which puts a watermark on images to show they have not been digitally altered. ""Companies that are thinking along those lines would be eligible for a tax credit. It sort of models what we did with the Wellness Tax Credit program that was ongoing for several years,"" Khan said. That program encouraged employers to offer wellness programs for employees, and expired in 2017. ### ""I think there's a movement in that direction, to be more realistic. It's happening slowly,"" Khan said. ""We can speed it up by offering tax credits to get people more aware and thinking about what we should be doing to protect young people."" The deadline for lawmakers to sign onto the bill is June 6, according to Khan's office. Khan is co-chair of the Joint Committee on Children, Families and Persons with Disabilities and is a psychiatric nurse.  Get in touch: smurray@politico.com. ### TODAY — Gov.

Opponents of the bill, which would transfer the Kempton School property to the Alma Del Mar charter school for its new campus, have used procedural maneuvers over the past week to prevent it from even being assigned to a committee for a public hearing. Sen. Patricia Jehlen of Somerville was the latest to throw up a roadblock, using a procedural motion Thursday to block the bill from being assigned to the Joint Committee on Education .” ### – “Following Data Release, More Hearings Set For Weymouth Compressor Air Permit,” by Barbara Moran, WBUR: “A state official decided Thursday to reopen appeals hearings regarding an air permit for a controversial proposed natural gas compressor station in Weymouth. The decision comes after two tumultuous weeks in which the state Department of Environmental Protection released new air quality data showing higher carcinogen levels around the proposed site than previously reported, and then faced possible sanctions for the delay in releasing the data .” ### – “DeLeo sidestepping Baker on bonds,” by Bruce Mohl, CommonWealth Magazine: “HOUSE SPEAKER ROBERT DELEO is using a novel funding approach for his climate change legislation, authorizing the issuance of $1 billion in state general obligation bonds that would be exempt from controls set by the Baker administration. The Legislature regularly approves bond authorizations allowing state government to borrow money for all sorts of projects. To prevent overspending with borrowed money, the governor has the legislative authority to set caps on the amount of bonds that can be issued each year and the amount of interest on bonds that can be paid out of the state budget. The two caps give the governor wide latitude to determine how many bonds actually get issued each year and for what purposes .” ### – “Senate adds $250K to budget for Knowledge Corridor,” by Anita Fritz, Greenfield Recorder: “The state Senate has included $250,000 in its budget to market what is known as the Knowledge Corridor Rail pilot program set to begin this summer. “I am delighted that my colleague Sen. Lesser and I were able to secure $250,000 in the Senate budget for the North-South passenger rail marketing,” Sen. Jo Comerford, D-Northampton, said. “These funds will be used to raise critical public awareness and excitement at the onset of this pilot program.” Comerford said the expanded train service is the result of years of work by many lawmakers at every level of government, and the marketing funds essentially lock in tens of millions of public dollars already invested in the project .” ### – Betting notes: DeLeo wants floor vote on sports bill,” by Andy Metzger, CommonWealth Magazine: “THERE ARE SCORES of variables for lawmakers to consider as they put together a regulatory scheme to legalize sports betting, but Speaker Robert DeLeo has already made up his mind on one important aspect of the pending legislation: there should be a bill brought to the House floor. The speaker telegraphed his hope for a big standalone bill by keeping sports-betting language out of the House budget and a spokeswoman this week confirmed that his goal is to bring a bill to the floor for debate this session. That bill could open up a whole new way to gamble and a new revenue stream for the state. To see it become law, DeLeo will need cooperation from Senate President Karen Spilka, who has said little about where she stands .” ### – “Attorney General Maura Healey Vows To Fight For Abortion Access,” by Zoe Matthews, WGBH News: “A legislative and potential legal battle is shaping up around abortion, and pro-choice advocates have a fighter on their side in Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. In an interview on Boston Public Radio Thursday, Healey said she supports the ROE Act, an effort to codify and expand abortion access in the state. ""This is just playing catch up,"" Healey said, noting that other states like New York and Connecticut already have more progressive laws around abortion access. Multiple state legislatures, like Alabama and Georgia, have recently passed into law policies that limit or restrict abortion, some even in cases of rape or incest .” ### FROM THE HUB ### – “Sunday's Dot Day parade follows historic trail,” by Chris Lovett, Dorchester Reporter: “The first observance of Dorchester Day, in June of 1904, took place under a tent on Savin Hill. A celebration of local history and pride, it was also meant to protect an urban wild with a panoramic view from a frenzy of new development. But by the beginning of the 20th century, the fast pace of change in Dorchester was hard to ignore. Over the fifty years after its annexation to Boston, in 1870, Dorchester’s population would increase more than ten-fold. And, even by 1910, more than one-third of the growing population in all of Boston was made up of immigrants .” ### – “A MODERN METCO,” by Brendan McGuirk, Boston Institute for Nonprofit Journalism: “For more than 50 years, Metco has stood as a hallmark effort to address racial disparities in education. But for the progressive civil rights program to keep pace with the national dialogue around race, inequality, and white supremacy, stakeholders say it’s time to reexamine and recommit to Massachusetts’ once-radical program .” ### – Boston teachers would get 2 percent pay raises under contract deal,” by James Vaznis, Boston Globe: “Officials from the Boston Public Schools and the Boston Teachers Union on Thursday night signed a tentative contract that offers 2 percent annual pay raises, guarantees a full-time nurse in every school, and provides an aide for every kindergarten classroom. Details on the three-year pact emerged one day after the union notified its more than 7,500 members that an “agreement in principle” had been reached. The agreement paves the way for ratification by union members on June 12. The School Committee will likely vote a week later .” ### – “Pioneer Institute, UMass feud intensifies over Boston campus,” by Joe Dwinell, Boston Herald: “The UMass brass is not budging in its fiscal feud with a top think tank over accusations of shoddy oversight at the beleaguered Boston campus. The Pioneer Institute, which slammed UMass President Martin T. Meehan over his handling of finances at the UMass Boston campus earlier this week, called out university leaders for not agreeing to an audit. “Pioneer Institute is disappointed that University of Massachusetts leadership refuses to join with Pioneer to request that the State Comptroller’s Office audit the university’s financial oversight,” the think tank said in a statement Thursday .” ### – THEY SHOULD GET OVER IT: “A New Map Shows Basically the Whole Country Hates the Bruins,” by Spencer Buell, Boston Magazine: “New England sports fans are not exactly known for giving a rat’s ass what the rest of the country thinks of our teams, so gonna go out on a limb and guess this won’t bother any of you. But a new map sourced from social media data shows that when it comes to the Stanley Cup, the vast majority of states are rooting against the Bruins. The potentially legit gambling website sportsbettingexperts.com crunched the numbers on 40,000 tweets, comparing the number of tweets in favor of Boston—for example, tweets with the hashtag #gobruins—to those that showed preference for the St. Louis Blues, like #weallbleedblue. A spokesman tells me the website used the social media-scraping tool Trendsmap to reach its conclusions .” ### TRUMPACHUSETTS ### – “At Harvard, a not-so-veiled rebuke of Trump by Angela Merkel,” by Deirdre Fernandes, Boston Globe: “German Chancellor Angela Merkel offered a sharp and not-so-veiled rebuke of President Trump and his brand of nationalism during her commencement speech at Harvard University on Thursday. Merkel never mentioned Trump by name, but warned graduating students of the dangers of building walls and approaching the world’s problems — from climate change and trade to terrorism and forced migration — with an isolationist, go-it-yourself philosophy .” ### THE OPINION PAGES ### – “If this is the new ‘pro-life’ movement, count me out,” Rep. Stephen Lynch, Boston Globe: “While my position on the issue of abortion has never fit neatly on a bumper sticker, I have always used the term “pro-life’’ to describe myself, no doubt a position partly informed by my faith. And it’s partly because of that faith — not despite it — that I am compelled to denounce and reject the recent efforts in several states to isolate, abandon, and condemn women who wish to avoid pregnancy or are faced with an unwanted pregnancy .” ### – “Want to fix our broken democracy? Have a block party,” by Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu: “As individuals we can feel powerless at the scale of the political crisis unfolding daily, with government refusing to confront any of the disasters looming before us: climate crisis, opioid crisis, housing crisis, constitutional crisis, structural racism, deepening income inequality, crushing congestion. But our divided politics isn’t the problem. It’s a symptom of the underlying societal ailment that each one of us has a role in treating: a crisis of trust .” ### ON THE STUMP ### – HMMM: “FEC to Mitt Romney, Michele Bachmann and 48 more zombie campaigns: Why are you still here?” by Christopher O'Donnell, Eli Murray, Connie Humburg and Noah Pransky, Tampa Bay Times: “The federal agency that oversees elections demanded explanations on Wednesday from about 50 politicians who are operating zombie campaigns — political committees that keep spending contributions long after the campaign has ended. The Federal Election Commission sent letters to the campaigns Wednesday asking why their campaign accounts were still open. It flagged specific expenses by at least 17 campaigns and asked them to justify the spending. It is the first action taken by the agency since it announced in April 2018 that it would start scrutinizing the spending of what it called “dormant” campaigns .” ### DAY IN COURT ### – “Judge charged with helping man evade agent wants salary back,” Associated Press: “A Massachusetts judge indicted on charges that she helped a defendant evade an immigration enforcement agent wants her pay reinstated while she fights the allegations. Newtown District Judge Shelley Joseph was suspended without pay last month after she was charged with helping a man who was living in the U.S. illegally to slip out a back courthouse door to avoid a waiting federal agent. Joseph has pleaded not guilty .” ### WARREN REPORT ### – “Elizabeth Warren releases child-care cost calculator to promote universal child-care plan,” by Christina Prignano, Boston Globe: “Senator Elizabeth Warren is releasing a new cost calculator to promote her universal child-care plan. The new tool on her website is an attempt to cast her nationwide child-care policy in highly personal terms and builds off a similar tool released earlier this year that allowed users to calculate how much they would save under her student debt plan. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate announced the new calculator during an appearance Thursday on “The View.” Warren has proposed making child care free for families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty line. Under her plan, those making more would pay on a sliding scale topping out at 7 percent of a family’s income .” ### FROM THE DELEGATION ### – “Markey slams Trump ‘stealth attack’ on immigrants,” by Sarah Betancourt, CommonWealth Magazine: “US SEN. EDWARD MARKEY released a report on Thursday that he said “helps to pull back the curtain” on ways President Trump is reducing the number of immigrants coming into the country. The report, titled “Under the Radar: The Trump Administration’s Stealth Attack on the US Immigration System,” said Trump has lowered the number of immigrants allowed into the country, restricted asylum claims, stepped up enforcement, and slowed down judicial processing. The report sourced most of the information from sources such as the Department of Homeland Security’s field guides, the Congressional Research Service, and Trump’s own executive orders .” ### MARIJUANA IN MASSACHUSETTS ### – “Dozens of doctors, scientists warn Mass. marijuana is ripe for ‘regulatory failure,’” by Naomi Martin, Boston Globe: “Dozens of local doctors and scientists criticized the state’s marijuana regulatory system Thursday, saying the current rules don’t adequately protect public health from high-potency cannabis products now sold legally at 19 stores around Massachusetts. Consumers of THC, marijuana’s main psychoactive compound, are at risk of becoming addicted, and face increased risk of “serious mental health problems including acute psychosis paranoia, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and suicide,” the statement said .” ### ABOVE THE FOLD ### — Herald : “COPS HIT JACKPOT!” — Globe : “REBUILDING A BRIDGE TO GET OUT OF A JAM,"" ""Tentative deal gives teachers 2% raises,"" ""In swing districts, Democrats wary on impeachment.” ### FROM THE 413 ### – “How work-to-rule is playing out at Bridge Street Elementary School,” by Greta Jochem, Daily Hampshire Gazette: “John Zyskowski, a fourth-grade teacher at Bridge Street Elementary School, typically spends about four hours each week communicating with parents about students, particularly those with high needs. But lately, that kind of communication has gotten more difficult. Since last Monday, educators and school staff have been working-to-rule — or not working outside their contractual obligations and hours — in response to stalled negotiations between the Northampton Association of School Employees (NASE), the union that represents teachers and other school staff, and the School Committee .” ### THE LOCAL ANGLE ### – “Pow-Wow Oak lives on,” by Nicole DeFeudis, The Lowell Sun: “Perhaps it was a squirrel that dropped a maple acorn into the stump of the historic Pow-Wow Oak tree on Clark Road. Or maybe it was ""a guardian angel,"" said George Koumantzelis, leader of the Pow-Wow Oak Protectors, a local environmental group. Either way, he said, it sure was a miracle. Now, a 7-foot tall maple sapling grows from the stump considered sacred by many locals .” ### – “Baker in Worcester urges easing rules that impede home building,” by George Barnes, Telegram & Gazette: “Gov.

Mr. Baker told those gathered in Edge at Union Station Thursday afternoon that the state has seen a significant increase in population since 2000 but housing growth has not kept pace .” ### – “With 13 colleges and universities in the Greater Worcester area, how can the city better leverage itself as a college town?” by Aviva Luttrell, MassLive.com: “As Worcester’s economy continues to grow, state leaders say the city should position itself as a college town while promoting its cultural resources and affordable housing to better retain graduates after they leave school. ""I think there's an opportunity here to sort of package that and promote it for Worcester,” Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said of the city’s various assets during a visit to Clark University Thursday. ‘The fact that Worcester has nine academic institutions within it and 13 within the Greater Worcester area, how do we become better known as a college town? How do we better position the 35,000 to 40,000 graduates to stay here, to grow their roots further and begin their jobs and careers here in Central Massachusetts? ’” ### – “Parade vehicle with Confederate flag draws criticism,” by Jennifer Solis, The Salem News: “Amid a chorus of praise from residents for this year’s Memorial Day parade and ceremonies, the presence of a Confederate flag and aggressive language on a vehicle rolling down Main Street on Monday has has drawn criticism from residents who found the display to be offensive. The truck in question was one of three military vehicles arranged by Bernie Fields, who has participated in previous Memorial Day parades, according to Town Manager Angus Jennings. The words “Hell’s Breed” were painted on the passenger’s side, and “Hired Killers” painted across the back. A small Confederate flag was attached to its antenna .” ### MEDIA MATTERS ### – “Local news is tanking. Report for America aims to help save it,” by Zoe Greenberg, Boston Globe: “The biggest news story in Woods Hole is climate change: sand dunes breaching, beaches eroding, thickets of algae breeding. Experts at six science centers here analyze the effects of warming; residents live them. Yet the National Public Radio affiliate, which was founded almost 20 years ago, does not have a reporter focused exclusively on the environment. That’s about to change. In June, the station will get a full-time reporter to concentrate solely on the human impacts of climate change through the Report for America program. Taking inspiration from Teach for America, the organization deploys early-career reporters to local newsrooms across the country to fill gaps in local coverage.

On May 27, one of his son’s friends visited the office, where he started drinking liquor. When his son asked the boy not to drink there, he did not budge and continued doing so. ### It was only when his son warned his friend that he would click a photograph and send it to his parents that he left the office. The same day, his son got a call from Daba police station and the caller told him to reach the police station as someone has filed a complaint against him. ### “When we reached Daba police station, the SHO told me to leave my son at the police station and take him after sometime. I continued this practice for two days. On May 28, when I was taking my son home, he was not able to walk properly, following which I took him to a hospital. On Thursday, when I again went to drop my son at the police station, the SHO asked us to bring Rs50,000 bribe, saying that I would be able to take my son from the police station only after that,” the complainant said. ### He then filed a complaint before the Police Commissioner and in no time, the SHO released his son. ### When contacted, ADCP-2, Jaskiranjit Singh said he was asked to probe the matter by the top cop and nothing could be said without verifying the matter. ### However, SHO Daba, Bachan Singh, said he was not aware of any such matter and he had no idea who Bachu Lal and Lakshman were.",60119,1,"Illegal detention charge against SHO, plaint filed###Also in this section###Tribune News Service###Ludhiana, May 31###A resident of New Azad Nagar has filed a complaint with the Commissioner of Police against the SHO of Daba police station for demanding a bribe of Rs50,000 to release his son from illegal detention.###The CP reportedly asked the Additional DCP-2 to probe the matter.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]","<p>Illegal detention charge against SHO, plaint filed</p><p>Also in this section</p><p>Tribune News Service</p><p>Ludhiana, May 31</p><p>A resident of New Azad Nagar has filed a complaint with the Commissioner of Police against the SHO of Daba police station for demanding a bribe of Rs50,000 to release his son from illegal detention.</p><p>The CP reportedly asked the Additional DCP-2 to probe the matter.</p>",676
87019,"ePaper ### Just In ### A tale of two cities ### June 01, 2019 16:49 IST ### Updated: ### June 01, 2019 16:50 IST ### Share Article ### June 01, 2019 16:49 IST ### Updated: ### June 01, 2019 16:50 IST ### more-in ### General Elections 2019 ### The 2019 elections may well be remembered as the battle of awkward metaphors ### In their introductory essay to The Continuum Companion to Hindu Studies, the editors summarise various ‘models’ that academics use to understand how Hindu belief and society interact. To some scholars, Hinduism is a pot pourri of beliefs, to others it is a banyan tree, and to some a kaleidoscope. The list of metaphors and analogies goes on. While the underlying conceit behind such a list is to impress upon the reader the difficulty of thinking about Hinduism, two deep truths emerge. One, humans rely on a combination of metaphors, analogies, and similes to comprehend complex phenomena. Two, metaphors, analogies, and similes can illuminate but also obscure and lead us to believe that the metaphor is the world. ### In the recently concluded elections, no metaphor was more widespread than ‘chowkidaar’ — a trisyllabic noun upon which was foisted the politics of 1.2 billion Indians. From the shrill chowkidaar chor hein campaign that was met by the fury of main bhi chowkidaar — the 2019 elections may well be remembered as the battle of awkward metaphors. ### Changing forms ### But metaphors in politics that aim to cut through the noise to distil political messaging don’t stop at the level of the individual or campaign slogans. When viewed from a certain distance, and without the emotional urgencies of the present, political parties can resemble cities. Some large, some small, some mere townships masquerading as metropolises. All, however, have a period of growth that in turn facilitates the creation of elites within, who eventually resist new ideas, which lays the seeds of decline. ### But unlike cities, which can sometimes suffer body blows (ask Vijayanagara), political parties don’t always need to die. Instead, they can merely change forms, lay low for a stretch, then when the wheel of time turns in their favour, their ideas can gain currency, reproduce feverishly, and a renaissance can begin. ### Viewed thus, the BJP — now flush with victory — reminds one of a city like Shanghai. Cash-rich, marked by energy, steeled by a party leadership that remains unquestioned and, more importantly, filled with a collective optimism that, finally, their time is now. In contrast, a party like the Congress — despairing about the future — reminds one of Kolkata. Once a great, historic city, but now riven with a fraying infrastructure, an old elite who view the rest with condescension, and the young who escape it for greener pastures. ### Framed in this manner, the challenges facing both the ‘national’ parties are radically different. For the BJP, it is one of how to sustain its drive and energy, how to keep its pipes unclogged of bureaucratism and factionalism, and ultimately how to make itself acceptable to a wider world that still views it suspiciously as an authoritarian wolf in democrat’s clothing. Narendra Modi’s inaugural speech in the Central Hall was filled with a premonition of these curveballs coming down the line. ### For the Congress, however, the challenge is not just diametrically opposite but also more existential: how to become relevant again? While there are tactical answers offered up by many, it is important to recognise that the Congress and its courtiers still talk of the Congress as a ‘big tent’ party, when in reality it is now only an insurgent. What history teaches us is that any kind of political rebirth requires three ingredients — a mass movement, the courage of one’s convictions, and an enemy. ### The hardest of all ### One, the Congress needs to be heavily invested in a medium-term socio-political struggle that comports with historical forces and demographics, no different from the BJP, which bootstrapped itself to power on the backs of a decade-long Ram Janmabhoomi movement or the caste-based parties that were born from the Mandal agitations. ### Two, the Congress must be lucky in that the BJP makes a fatal mistake, but it also must find the courage to capitalise on that error. No different from the BJP, which capitalised on the Shah Bano case. ### And the third is the identification of an enemy — a group, in opposition to whom one defines one’s own political identity. This is the hardest of all. ### Absent these, it is entirely likely that the Congress will survive — an election victory here and another there, through an assemblage of tactics, cunning, and supplication to regional parties. But, over time, in an act of historical irony, the Congress will have slowly returned to the days of A.O.

Resentment has been growing in parts of central Mexico as the flow of migrants has continued. Towns were receptive and welcoming to the first caravans last year, but more recently have felt overwhelmed. Marco Ugarte AP Photo ### WASHINGTON ### Despite pushback from U.S. business, Mexico and Capitol Hill, President Donald Trump is doubling down on his threat to slap a 5% tariff on Mexican imports unless America's southern neighbor cracks down on Central American migrants trying to cross the U.S. border. ### U.S. manufacturers said the tariff, set to take effect June 10, would have devastating consequences on them and American consumers. U.S. stocks tumbled on Wall Street in response to Trump's planned action. ### ""Imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico is exactly the wrong move,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is exploring legal action in response to the tariffs. ""These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border. Instead, Congress and the president need to work together to address the serious problems at the border."" ### Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador dispatched his foreign secretary to Washington to try to negotiate a solution. He said social problems are not solved with coercive measures, but also seemed convinced that Trump just needed to be informed about all the steps Mexico has taken to slow illegal migration. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to The Tribune content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### Mexico has stepped up raids on migrant caravans traveling through the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca this year. It has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more who wait endlessly for permits that would allow them to travel legally through Mexico. ### U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with his Mexican counterpart via telephone Friday, said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, who's traveling with Pompeo in Bern, Switzerland. Ortagus said the department doesn't comment on details of diplomatic conversations. ### ""We maintain an ongoing dialogue and close cooperation with Mexico on a wide range of issues, including border security efforts,"" she said. ""The United States and Mexico recognize that managing our shared border is a challenge common to both countries."" ### Administration officials told reporters in a briefing call Thursday evening that Mexico could prevent the tariffs from kicking in by securing its southern border with Guatemala, cracking down on criminal smuggling organizations, and entering into a ""safe third country agreement"" that would make it difficult for those who enter Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the U.S. ### ""We fully believe they have the ability to stop people coming in from their southern border and if they're able to do that, these tariffs will either not go into place or will be removed after they go into place,"" said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. ### Trump said the percentage will gradually increase — up to 25% — until the migration problem is remedied. ### ""Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades,"" Trump said in a tweet Friday. ""Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!"" ### Trump's decision showed the administration going to new lengths, and looking for new levers, to pressure Mexico to take action — even if those risk upending other policy priorities, like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal that is the cornerstone of Trump's legislative agenda and seen as beneficial to his reelection effort. ### Keeping the economy rolling also is critical to Trump's reelection, and business was not happy with the president's planned tariff on Mexican imports. ### ""These proposed tariffs would have devastating consequences on manufacturers in America and on American consumers,"" said Jay Timmons, chief executive officer of the National Association of Manufacturers. ""We have taken our concerns to the highest levels of the administration and strongly urge them to consider carefully the impact of this action on working families across this country."" ### The stock market's tumble on Friday all but guarantees that May will be the first monthly loss for the market in 2019. The news hit automakers particularly hard. Many of them import vehicles into the U.S. from Mexico. ### ""The auto sector — and the 10 million jobs it supports — relies upon the North American supply chain and cross border commerce to remain globally competitive,"" said the Auto Alliance, which represents automakers that built 70% of all cars and light trucks sold in U.S. ""Any barrier to the flow of commerce across the U.S.-Mexico border will have a cascading effect — harming U.S. consumers, threatening American jobs and investment and curtailing economic progress."" ### Some of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress opposed the tariff. Republican senators have made almost weekly treks to the White House to nudge the president off his trade wars, and this latest move sent them scrambling again to signal their displeasure in hopes of reversing Trump's actions. ### Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn supports the president's commitment to securing the border, an aide said, but he opposes the across-the-board tariff, ""which will disproportionately hurt Texas."" ### Key trade senators also spoke up. Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey, who has questioned the administration's ability to invoke national security threats for some other imports, called the tariffs a ""blanket tax increase"" on items Americans purchases from Mexico and ""the wrong remedy."" ### The tariff threat comes at a peculiar time, given how hard the administration has been pushing for passage of the USMCA, which would update the North American Free Trade Agreement. ### Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a usual Trump ally and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, slammed the president's action, saying it was a ""misuse of presidential tariff authority"" that would burden American consumers and ""seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA."" ### Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said the livelihoods of farmers and producers from her state are at risk and so is the USMCA. ### ""If the president goes through with this, I'm afraid progress to get this trade agreement across the finish line will be stifled,"" she said. ### ___ ### Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Kevin Freking and Paul Wiseman in Washington and Maria Verza in Mexico City contributed to this report.",60119,1,"Some of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress opposed the tariff.

Todd Spencer ### 12 killed in Virginia Beach municipal center ### 1  /  3 ### Back to Gallery ### A municipal building in Virginia Beach, Virginia, was turned into a scene of carnage Friday afternoon after a longtime public utilities employee began firing indiscriminately at his co-workers, killing at least 12 people and injuring four others before dying after a shootout with police. ### It had been nearing closing time in an office offering some of the most mundane functions of city government, such as paying water bills and applying for building permits, when the employee, whose name and possible motive were not immediately disclosed, began stalking through several floors firing at his colleagues, authorities said. ### The loud bursts of gunfire sent workers scrambling and barricading their office doors. ""My boss basically was like, 'This is not a drill, get down, call 911,'"" said Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who was in the building where the shooting happened. ### About 20 people in her second-floor office were hugging and holding one another, she said, as a bloody scene unfolded in the building. They heard gunshots, shouts from police officers to ""get down"" and frantic conversations in a stairwell outside their office, she said. She stayed on the phone with 911 to make sure police were coming. ### ""They couldn't come fast enough,"" she said. ### The identities of the victims were not released. One of those injured was a police officer, who was saved by his bulletproof vest, said Chief James Cervera of the Virginia Beach Police Department. ### He called the shooting a ""devastating incident"" that ""none of us want to be here talking about,"" adding that it was ""going to change the lives of a number of families in our city."" ### The shooting took place shortly after 4 p.m. within the sprawling Virginia Beach Municipal Center, a campus of city offices and agencies, including the Police Department. The attack unfolded on multiple floors in Building No. 2, which includes offices for planning and public works, among others, and is adjacent to City Hall. ### ""This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,"" Mayor Robert Dyer said at an evening news conference. ### ""The people involved are our friends, co-workers, neighbors, colleagues,"" he continued before his voice trailed off and he bowed his head. ### Dale Gauding, a spokesman for Sentara Healthcare, said five patients were taken to Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital. ### Another patient at Sentara Princess Anne Hospital was being picked up by helicopter and transferred to a trauma center at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, he said. Details on their conditions were not immediately available. ### ""This day will not define Virginia Beach,"" a City Council member, Aaron Rouse, said at the news conference. ""We will show the strength of our city."" ### Another council member, Barbara Henley, told The Virginian-Pilot that she had been pulling up to City Hall when she heard police sirens and saw police cars. After initially thinking it was an accident, she heard a male voice shout ""Get down!"" and saw people scattering. ### ""I was scared to death,"" she said. ### All over Virginia Beach, residents were trying to process such horror on what had been the close to a normal week. ""It is an awful, awful day for our wonderful city,"" said Will Sessoms, the former mayor of Virginia Beach, who retired last year. ""We will get through it. We will get through it."" ### Eerily, police had scheduled a community workshop for Saturday morning on how to prepare for a mass shooting. The ""active threat citizens defense"" event had 36 people scheduled to attend, according to the department's Facebook page. ### ""Having to face an armed individual with bad intentions is every person's worst nightmare. You can't stop crazy, you can only respond to it,"" said a brochure for the workshop published by the local ABC News affiliate. ### ""You don't prepare for something like this,"" said Dyer. ""It's a nightmare no one wants to actually live through."" ### Nothing like this has happened in Virginia Beach in the 40 years that Guy King Tower, a City Council member and retired lawyer, has been living there. ""Nothing remotely like it, certainly in my memory,"" said Tower, who has been living in the city since the 1970s but just joined the council a month ago. ### He was at the municipal center early Friday afternoon, but left before the shooting. He said that Building 2 — where the shooting occurred — is connected by a tunnel to Building 1, which is the main administrative office. ### He said that in addition to a dominant Navy presence, the area also has Marine, Army and Air Force bases. ""This is a military town, and people deal with the wages of war on a pretty regular basis,"" Tower said. ""There are a lot of people here who have had loved ones in harm's way. But certainly a mass murder had never happened that I can recall.""",60119,1,"All over Virginia Beach, residents were trying to process such horror on what had been the close to a normal week.

St. Louis overcame 1-0 and 2-1 deficits to ultimately earn a 3-2 overtime victory. It was the first win for the Blues in their Stanley Cup history (14 games). ### Not only did the Bruins lose and surrender home ice advantage, they also lost defenseman Matt Grzelcyk for at least Game 3. He was knocked out of  Game 2 on a hard hit by Blues forward Oskar Sundqvist, who is suspended for Wednesday's matchup. Bruins center Patrice Bergeron also might be a bit banged up , so the B's are going to need contributions from their other star players, most notably Brad Marchand and David Pastrnak. Both Pastrnak and Marchand have struggled offensively in the series and only Marchand has scored (empty-net goal in Game 1). ### Here's how and when to watch Bruins and Blues square off in Game 3 of the 2019 Stanley Cup Final. Be sure to also watch ""Hockey Pregame Live"" at 7 p.m. ET with Michael Felger and Tony Amonte on NBC Sports Boston, as well as ""Hockey Postgame Live"" with Felger and Amonte after the game. ### When: Saturday, June 1 at 8 p.m. ET ### TV Channel: NBC Sports Network ### Bobby Orr was all over score sheet from last Bruins' Stanley Cup game in St. Louis ### Bobby Orr was all over score sheet from last Bruins' Stanley Cup game in St. Louis ### By Nick Goss June 01, 2019 7:09 PM ### The Boston Bruins have many fond Stanley Cup Final memories from playing in St. Louis, and they are hoping to add some more Saturday night. ### The Bruins will take on the Blues in their first Cup Final game in St. Louis since May 5, 1970, when the B's won 6-2 to take a 2-0 series lead back to the old Boston Garden. ### Watch Bruins Game 3 hype video ### The NHL tweeted Saturday a photo of the score sheet from that Game 2 in 1970, and unsurprisingly, legendary Boston defenseman Bobby Orr's name shows up a few times. ### Tonight's encounter will be the first #StanleyCup Final game played in St. Louis since May 5, 1970, when the @StLouisBlues hosted the @NHLBruins in Game 2 of the 1970 Final. ### — NHL Public Relations (@PR_NHL) June 1, 2019 ### Orr tallied two assists in the Bruins' victory, and he later clinched the Stanley Cup for Boston with his iconic flying goal in overtime of Game 4. ### The Blues are hoping their first Cup Final game at home in 49 years gives them the boost of adrenaline and energy needed to take a series lead -- something they've never had in their three previous Cup Final appearances in 1968, 1969 and 1970. ### Taking a 2-1 edge in the series could be quite difficult, however, because the Bruins own a 6-2 record (including a four-game win streak) on the road in the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. ### Bruins' Stanley Cup Final Game 3 hype video all about 'will to succeed' ### Bruins' Stanley Cup Final Game 3 hype video all about 'will to succeed' ### By Nick Goss June 01, 2019 6:14 PM ### The Boston Bruins lost home ice advantage in the 2019 Stanley Cup Final with an overtime loss to the St. Louis Blues in Game 2, and the Original Six club's first chance to take back that edge is Saturday night. ### The Bruins and Blues soon will square off in a pivotal Game 3 of the series at Enterprise Center. It's the first Stanley Cup Final game played in St. Louis since May 5, 1970, and the Blues have never won a Cup Final matchup (0-6 overall) on home ice. ### The B's posted a hype video to Twitter a few hours before puck drop in Game 3. Check it out in the video below: ### It takes the will to succeed. #NHLBruins pic.twitter.com/mF3or1XA47 ### B's find movitation in visitors' locker room ### The Bruins have enjoyed tremendous success away from TD Garden in the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. They are 6-2 on the road, and that record includes a four-game win streak that dates back to their second-round series versus the Columbus Blue Jackets. ### Saturday night's Game 3 will be the Bruins' toughest road test of the postseason, however. Many Blues fans have waited more than four decades to see Cup Final action again, so we should expect a raucous St. Louis crowd for these next two games. ### Click here  to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

McCain, arrives for joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises at Donghae Harbor, South Korea, on July 24, 2010. ### (CNN) - The US Navy acknowledged Friday that a request had been made regarding the USS John S. McCain in relation to President Donald Trump's visit to Japan, but said the ship ended up remaining in its normal configuration. ### The statement continues a saga stemming from emails exchanged between the White House and lower-level US Navy officials about keeping a warship named for the late Sen. John McCain's father and grandfather out of sight ahead of the President's trip. ### Related Content ### Klobuchar: McCain recited dictator names during Trump's inauguration ### ""A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S.

""There were also no intentional efforts to explicitly exclude Sailors assigned to USS John S. McCain."" ### Brown added that the Navy is ""fully cooperating with the review of this matter tasked by"" acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. ### Two Navy officials told CNN on Wednesday that the White House Military Office had asked lower-level US Navy officials about keeping the ship out of view -- an impractical request as the ship was under repair, one of the officials said. ### ""Once leadership heard about it, they said knock it off,"" a senior Navy official told CNN. ### The ship ultimately was not moved nor was the name obscured, said Cmdr. Clay Doss, a spokesman for the 7th Fleet. ### Trump told reporters Thursday that while he had had no knowledge of the plan nor would he have acted on it, he ""is not a big fan"" of McCain, and whoever was behind the plan was ""well-meaning."" ### When asked abut the controversy Friday, Shanahan maintained that the military would not be politicized , adding that he would not have directed the ship to be moved. ### ""Our business is to run military operations and not to become politicized,"" Shanahan told reporters at a Singapore news conference. ""I'll wait until I get a full explanation of the facts before I pass judgment on the situation, but our job is to run the military."" ### CNN's Ryan Browne, Kate Sullivan and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report. ### The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

61915,"Upper East Mall is Bacolod City’s latest gem ### Philippine Daily Inquirer / 03:11 AM June 01, 2019 ### Many flock to the thriving City of Bacolod for a number of reasons. ### ADVERTISEMENT ### Tourists, for one, are drawn to its culinary treats as well as the heritage sites and museums within the city and neighboring areas, while investors are mostly attracted to Bacolod’s improving infrastructure, a conducive business climate and its warm, gentle people. Others simply revel in its unique vibe exuding from a seamless blend of old world charm and modern conveniences. ### But there will soon be another reason to be in Bacolod City—one that is poised to become an architectural marvel, a welcome addition to the rich, colorful heritage of the city, and will surely be a new source of pride for the Negrenses. ### FEATURED STORIES ### SEC makes permanent cease-and-desist order vs KAPA ### The Upper East Mall, soon to rise within the 34-ha The Upper East township, is envisioned to become Bacolod’s architectural landmark and first “green” mall that will offer a well curated array of dining and retail options for the discerning Negrenses. ### This P1.2-billion, three-level lifestyle mall is being put up by property giant Megaworld Corp., which is also developing The Upper East township in Bacolod City. Launched late last month, The Upper East Mall is set to cater to the Negrenses’ refined tastes and strong affinity for the sophisticated and finer things. ### Property giant Megaworld is building the P1.2-billion Upper East Mall inside its 34-hectare The Upper East township in Bacolod City. To be completed in 2021, the three-level mall is envisioned to be the city’s new architectural landmark. Leading the unveiling of the mall’s design were (from left) Kevin L. Tan, chief strategy officer, Megaworld and Architect Raji Casas, design architect of CASAS+Architects. ### “What we are building in The Upper East is not just an ordinary mall. We are curating an architectural masterpiece that depicts the cosmopolitan vibe of our Bacolod township. This is just the first mall that we are building in this township because there is still more room for future expansion,” said Megaworld chief strategy officer Kevin L. Tan. ### Distinct features are set to make this 24,200-sqm space—which will be managed and operated by Megaworld Lifestyle Malls—stand out. ### Its design, which showcases a blend of neo-classical and art deco architecture, reminiscent of New York City’s Upper East Side cityscape, will be highlighted by a 48-meter high iconic clock tower that illuminates even at night—making it a major architectural landmark along the six-lane main avenue of the township that stretches from Lopez Jaena Street to Circumferential Road. ### Further highlighting this showpiece are its sustainable features including a solar panel roofing, energy efficient cooling system, escalators with eco-mode or crawl mode to reduce electricity consumption when not in use, a rainwater harvesting system, and a gray water recycling system wherein water discharged from the sewage treatment plant is used for secondary flushing of mall’s toilets and urinals. ### ADVERTISEMENT ### The Upper East Mall will likewise house several rows of restaurants facing a garden of century-old trees that will be surrounded by Koi ponds, while its four state-of-the-art cinemas and an open-air Food Hall with an indoor garden will surely be a treat for the mall goers. To further ensure convenience and accessibility, the mall will be directly connected to the future Transport Hub of The Upper East township, and just across the central park facing the two residential condominium towers of One Regis and Two Regis. ### “We are excited to see The Upper East transforming into a modern central business district (CBD) of Bacolod. In the next three to five years, we will see the residential towers, office towers, commercial buildings, hotel, church, parks, and this new lifestyle mall rising. We will also be opening the Upper East Avenue to the public in two years,” Tan added. ### Aside from The Upper East for which Megaworld is investing P28 billion to develop, the company is simultaneously completing its 54-ha Northill Gateway township located along the Bacolod-Silay Airport Access Road within the boundary of Talisay City and Bacolod City. The said township will also have its own lifestyle mall called Northill Town Center beside the residential villages of Forbes Hill and Fountain Grove. ### Megaworld, the country’s largest developer of integrated urban townships, is indeed betting big on Bacolod City, where its footprint will expand significantly upon completion of these projects, and where residents will soon benefit from its signature live-work-play concept. ### Read Next",60119,1,"The Upper East Mall, soon to rise within the 34-ha The Upper East township, is envisioned to become Bacolod’s architectural landmark and first “green” mall that will offer a well curated array of dining and retail options for the discerning Negrenses.###This P1.2-billion, three-level lifestyle mall is being put up by property giant Megaworld Corp., which is also developing The Upper East township in Bacolod City.

3328,"June 1, 2019 at 11:03 am ### | UPDATED: ### June 1, 2019 at 1:01 pm ### Friday, May 31, was the first day that people could visit Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge at Disneyland, but reservations will continue to be required through June 23 and it’s a sure bet the themed land will continue to be busy. ### With that in mind, we put together a list to help you make the most of your experience, drawn from our observations of how the first day went. ### Arrive early: The park recommends those with reservations check in two hours early at the Launch Bay and arrive 15 minutes before their reservation time to enter Galaxy’s Edge. On Friday, many guests lined up overnight and were moved into the park by 7 a.m. ### Hit Savi’s Workshop first and then Oga’s Cantina: Stop by Savi’s Workshop first to get a return time for the $200 lightsaber-building experience, then get in line for Oga’s Cantina before the line gets cut off. Note that at times Friday visitors initially entering the land found that they weren’t able to get in line for either attraction. ### Whatever you do, don’t head for Millennium Falcon Smugglers Run first: The line can balloon to 90 minutes or more at the beginning of each reservation window. If you do, you might miss out on seeing the cantina and the lightsaber experience. In the middle of each 4-hour window, the line will likely drop below 30 minutes. After the ride, spend the rest of your 4-hour window shopping, eating and exploring the land. And don’t wait to try to board the land’s lone ride until your final hour. That’s when the next reservation group enters and spikes the wait times again ### You don’t need to buy your merch inside the land: If you’re hoping to snag a Star Wars-themed shirt or pin, you can get it outside Galaxy’s Edge at such park locations as The World of Disney, the Emporium and Disney Hotel. ### Take advantage of other parts of the park being quiet: The rest of the park, including the parking lot and tram, appeared to be much quieter Friday morning with everyone else wanting to explore Batuu. That may make it the perfect time for annual passholders to scope out the other normally packed rides and experiences. Early in the day popular attractions in New Orleans Square were practically deserted. Pedestrian traffic had picked up in the early afternoon but rides such as the Haunted Mansion only had a 13-minute wait and Pirates of the Caribbean had a 10-minute one. ### Take advantage of a less busy Disney California Adventure, too: As 2 p.m. rolled around, shorter-than-usual lines greeted guests at DCA’smost popular attractions. Posted wait times included 15 minutes for Soarin’, 20 for Guardians of the Galaxy and Toy Story Midway Mania, and even “only” 60 for a Radiator Springs Racers. ### Get the latest news delivered daily!",60119,1,"Arrive early: The park recommends those with reservations check in two hours early at the Launch Bay and arrive 15 minutes before their reservation time to enter Galaxy’s Edge.

71277,"Owner of Santa Rosa luxury apartment complex to pay $60,000 to settle price-gouging case ### Kevin Fixler The Press Democrat ### 05.31.19 ### Karl Mondon ### An aerial view show the scope of devastation from the Tubbs Fire on Oct. 11, 2017 in the Coffey Park neighborhood of Santa Rosa. Controls on rent increases have been in effect since then. ### SANTA ROSA — The owner of a luxury apartment complex in Santa Rosa has been ordered by a Sonoma County judge to pay nearly $60,000 in penalties and restitution on charges of price gouging in the wake of the 2017 wildfires. ### FG Meadows, LLC, operator of the Meadows at Fountaingrove apartments, agreed to the settlement last month, according to the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office. ### Prosecutors said the company and its site managers hiked rents paid by roughly 20 tenants more than the 10% cap allowed by the state, as set by the state of emergency declared for the Northern California wildfires two years ago. ### “This case is part of the ongoing efforts of my office to ensure that victims of the fire and residents are not further victimized by landlords taking advantage of the challenging rental market in Sonoma County,” District Attorney Jill Ravitch said in a statement. ### The owner blamed a prior management company for the mistake and cooperated with prosecutors after a former tenant filed the price-gouging complaint, according to Caroline Fowler, a Sonoma County deputy district attorney. ### “This was not the most egregious we’ve had,” said Fowler, a lead prosecutor on the case along with Deputy District Attorney Matt Cheever. “Once we notified them of having violating the law, they quickly remedied the issue with their tenants.” ### Judge Elliot Daum’s order resolves the allegations of unlawful business practices, specifically, price gouging, according to the District Attorney’s Office. FG Meadows, based in Santa Rosa, agreed to pay $40,000 in civil penalties, $13,000 in restitution to the affected tenants and $5,000 in investigation costs to the District Attorney’s Office. ### The Meadows at Fountaingrove, located at 3587 and 3589 Round Barn Blvd., is a complex of two- and three-story buildings and includes one- and two- bedroom apartments and two-bedroom townhomes. The large complex, located near Nagasawa Park and Thomas Lake Harris Open Space, also offers residents a heated pool, sun deck and fitness center. ### A call to FG Meadows’ Santa Rosa office and an email requesting an interview resulted in an emailed statement from the company’s new site manager in Fountaingrove, Petaluma-based Basin Street Properties. ### “These events occurred before Basin Street Properties took over management of FG Meadows in May 2018,” Jennifer Rahman, property manager at Meadows at Fountaingrove, said in the prepared statement. “The staff that was in place when this occurred no longer works at FG Meadows. We are committed to providing fair and safe housing, and invest in keeping our team trained on best practices.” ### Under California law, a rent increase may not exceed 10% during a declared state of emergency. Violations can result in up to a year in jail and $10,000 in fines for criminal charges, and up to $5,000 in civil penalties for each charge. ### The consumer protection was included in Gov. Jerry Brown’s declaration of emergency on Oct. 9, 2017, a day after the destructive Northern California firestorms erupted. The consumer protection measure has since been extended several times. ### The state’s anti-gouging provision is set to expire Friday. Outside of Sonoma County, it covered Lake, Mendocino, Napa, Santa Barbara, Shasta and Siskiyou counties. Both Santa Rosa and Sonoma County have extended their own measures through at least July 21, meaning the rental caps will remain in effect through that time. ### Current listings at the Meadows at Fountaingrove range from $2,300 for a 750-square-foot, one-bedroom unit to $2,500-plus for a 1,400-square-foot, two-bedroom townhome, according to the complex’s website. ### The District Attorney’s Office continues to investigate two additional price-gouging cases against large apartment complexes, Fowler said. The resolution announced Thursday follows a similar case against Novato-based Admiral Callaghan Professional Center, LLC for rents over the legal limit on two complexes it owns in Santa Rosa and Rohnert Park. Those cases, resolved last year, resulted in more than $60,000 in civil penalties. ### Ravitch’s office has taken the regional lead on investigation and filing of price-gouging allegations stemming from the 2017 fires. It has filed seven criminal cases against individuals under the law. Most of those were resolved through diversion programs that included tenant reimbursements, renegotiated leases at legal limits and community service hours. ### The office pursued civil cases against FG Meadows, LLC and the Novato-based apartment owner because that option often leads to relief for affected tenants and restitution, Fowler said. ### Local ### Gov. Newsom extends anti-price gouging order ### Kevin Courtney                          / Register staff ### Rich Pedroncelli ### Gov. Gavin Newsom. ### Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Friday extending the state's prohibition against price gouging in Napa and other counties recovering from wildfires in 2017 and 2018. ### The original order was issued by his predecessor, Jerry Brown, after the devastation caused by the 2017 North Bay and Northern California fires, then extended it until this Friday. ### With the new order, controls on price increases on rents and a variety of supplies are extended until Dec. 31, 2019, in Napa, Mendocino, Santa Barbara, Shasta, and Sonoma counties. ### The order means that landlords, hotel or motel operators, and people who sell items such as emergency supplies, medical supplies, gasoline or building materials can’t raise rates by more than 10 percent, according to  state law . ### Earlier this week, local managers of rental properties in Napa County debated whether controls on rents were still necessary. ### Local ### Man faces 2 felony charges after fighting and having child with girlfriend, age 17, police say ### Courtney Teague                          / Register staff ### 05.31.19 ### A 22-year-old Sonoma County man was arrested Thursday afternoon on suspicion of domestic violence and statutory rape felony charges, police say. ### Napa Police Department officers responded to the 1200 block of West Street after receiving a report of a male and female fighting.

Representatives said a catastrophic humanitarian crisis is imminent and the Syrian NGO Alliance appealed to the United Nations Security Council to stop the escalation. ### Lefteris Pitarakis ### Save ### FILE - In this April 8, 2019, file photo, Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shake hands during their meeting in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia. The violence raging once again in the northwestern province of Idlib, Syria's last rebel-held bastion, is putting Turkish-Russian relations to the test. ### Alexei Nikolsky ### Save ### ISTANBUL (AP) — Ankara and Moscow are again facing an escalation of violence in Syria's last rebel-held territory, a development that puts their cooperation to the test even as they support opposing sides in the eight-year war that has devastated Syria. ### An all-out offensive by Syrian government forces to capture Idlib in northwestern Syria from insurgents could unleash an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, for the area is home to 3 million people. ### Turkey, which is already hosting more than 3.6 million Syrian refugees, is facing strong pressure from Syria, Iran and Russia to deliver on its pledge to control the armed rebel factions in Idlib. ### But Turkey also needs Russia to rein in Syrian President Bashar Assad to prevent a massive outflow of refugees and to keep Turkish soldiers on the ground safe. ### Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin ""have an incentive to cooperate and ensure that nobody's interests are totally trampled,"" says Aaron Stein, the director of the Middle East program in American think-tank Foreign Policy Research Institute. ### In September, the two leaders brokered a cease-fire for Idlib in the Russian resort of Sochi, preventing a bloody onslaught, despite the fact that Russia has firmly backed Assad and Turkey supports opposition forces. Nine months later, the truce has failed. ### The agreement called for a 15-to-20 kilometer (9-to-12 mile) demilitarized zone free of insurgents and heavy weaponry and for two key highways crossing through Idlib to be reopened. The demilitarized zone has been breached and the highways are at the center of the current government offensive. ### Syrian ground forces have been advancing from the south of the rebel stronghold under the cover of Syrian and Russian airstrikes. ### The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said more than 291 civilians and 369 fighters have been killed since April 30 in the rebel stronghold. In the same period, 269 government troops and 22 civilians were killed in government areas by rebel fire. The U.N.'s children's agency said more than 130 children have reportedly been killed. ### Already, more than 200,000 people from the stronghold have been displaced, according to the U.N., with some seeking safety near the border with Turkey while others crammed into crowded camps in Syria. ### Turkey has accused the Syrian government of violating the cease-fire and Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said the country has told Russia ""the regime must be controlled."" ### Russia has launched airstrikes in Idlib and is providing air cover in the Syrian government offensive. It has complained that the militants have increasingly been targeting its military base in the nearby coastal province of Latakia. ### But for now, Moscow is unlikely to support an all-out Syrian operation in Idlib because the benefits of a long-term alliance with Turkey outweigh one military battle. ### ""Russia doesn't want to ruin its relationship with Turkey because of Idlib,"" says Kirill Semenov, a Moscow-based Middle East analyst and expert at the Russian International Affairs Council. ### In late April, Putin said he would not rule out a large-scale assault but ""together with our Syrian friends, we believe that this would not be advisable"" due to humanitarian issues. ### Still, Russia's patience is wearing thin with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which it accuses of targeting its military base. HTS is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Russia and Turkey, despite its claims it has disassociated from al-Qaida. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### Top Russian officials have often called Idlib a ""breeding ground for terrorists."" ### Despite the cease-fire deal, Turkey has been unable to neutralize the extremists. Much of Idlib has come under the control of HTS, which has defeated Turkey-backed armed groups. ### Emre Ersan, an associate professor of international relations and political science at Istanbul's Marmara University, believes Turkey may have overestimated its influence over HTS. He says Turkey's plan to split the group and absorb its more moderate members has not worked. ### Instead, HTS has used Turkey as leverage against Russia and Assad-supporter Iran, according to Ersan. ### Subscribe to Breaking News ### Sign up!  ### Adding to the risks, Turkish troops are in the line of fire. Two Turkish soldiers were wounded in early May in a Syrian government artillery attack on an observation post. Three other attacks have been cited by Turkey's official Anadolu Agency, raising questions if the attacks were accidental or designed to pressure Ankara with Russia's knowledge. ### ""The Turkish Armed Forces will not take a single step back from where it is,"" Akar, Turkey's defense minister, said last week. ### Erdogan and Putin have talked on the phone, agreeing to continue working along the lines of the cease-fire agreement to prevent civilian deaths and a refugee flow. They also agreed to meet on the sidelines of next month's Group of 20 conference in Japan. ### ""Apart from this dialogue and cooperation, there is nothing on the ground that can prevent a catastrophe in Idlib,"" Ersan says. ### The presidents have become close since 2016, rebuilding their relations after a dramatic crisis in 2015 when Turkey shot down a Russian jet near the Syrian border. Their rapport comes amid Turkey's fragile relations with NATO ally United States, especially over Washington's support of Syrian Kurdish-led forces who control large swaths in eastern Syria. Ankara considers them an extension of a Kurdish insurgency operating inside Turkey. ### Erdogan is so far sticking to his promise to buy Russian-made S-400 missiles despite U.S. warnings the system would jeopardize Turkey's participation in the F-35 fighter jet program and compromise its safety. Stein calls this ""a big win for Russia."" Turkey is angling for a way to have both the S-400s and the F-35s. ### Turkey is also talking with the U.S. about a safe zone in northeastern Syria and has repeatedly asked for the U.S. to end its military support for Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. Erdogan will meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the G-20 as well. ### Ersan believes Russia may allow Turkey to grab the northern town of Tel Rifaat from the Kurdish fighters, the last town they control in western Syria. Russian support could help Turkey put pressure on the SDF, widen Turkish influence and strengthen its hand in ongoing negotiations with the U.S. ### In exchange, he argues, Turkey could be open to some limited Syrian operation toward Idlib. ### —",60119,1,Don't have an account?

Dorsey did not fully perform snow removal duties from the roof of an Eau Claire business after getting paid, stole checks and tools, and made unauthorized purchases at Menards. ### Dorsey, 33, 11546 12th Ave., pleaded no contest recently in Eau Claire County Court to three misdemeanor counts of theft, three felony counts of possession of methamphetamine, a felony count of theft in a business setting, a misdemeanor count of theft in a business setting, a felony count of forgery and misdemeanor counts of retail theft and operating after revocation. ### Judge Sarah Harless placed Dorsey on three years of probation and fined him $9,900. ### According to the criminal complaint in the snow removal case: ### An Eau Claire police officer responded on March 11 to Morgan Music on East Clairemont Avenue for a theft by contractor complaint. ### Dorsey, using the business name of Cedar Creek Restorations, provided a written estimate of $900 to remove snow from the roof of Morgan Music and haul it away. ### Morgan Music paid Dorsey $450 on Feb. 28 as a down payment. After working a couple hours, Dorsey said it was going to cost a lot more money, so the business gave him another $450. ### Dorsey never returned to complete the snow removal. Morgan Music tried calling Dorsey several times but Dorsey never returned the calls. ### According to the criminal complaint in one of the theft cases: ### At about 2:57 p.m. Aug. 8, deputies at the Eau Claire County sheriff’s office were advised a rural Eau Claire man called to make a fraud/theft complaint. ### A deputy spoke to the man, who said he and his wife noticed two unauthorized charges on their Menards credit line, and the total loss was about $13,000. ### The man said he called Menards and was told the charges were made under their dissolved business name and included in-store purchases. ### He and his wife then started looking at other financial statements and checkbooks, and they found multiple missing checks from their business and personal accounts. ### The man also reported there were at least $3,900 in unauthorized charges on their accounts in July and August, according to their bank. ### The man reported he had several power tools stolen as well. ### He said he suspected Dorsey because some of the checks had been written out to him.",60119,1,"To continue reading, please purchase a subscription.

Courtesy/the Orcutt Family ### Smoke fills the sky over downtown following the torching of homes and businesses during the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. ### The full story of what happened in 1921 in Tulsa cannot be known without the memories of white residents; an ironic view coming from a prominent African American historian, who is also a descendant of massacre survivors. ### John W. Franklin ### says with the passing of people with first-hand knowledge, it becomes more imperative families with artifacts and information from residents of that time offer what they have. ### Olivia Hooker, one of last Tulsa Race Massacre survivors died in this past year at age 103. She was an activist, psychology professor and first African American to join the U.S. Coast Guard. ### The task of recreating history isn’t new; it’s the life work of historians and anthropologists. Tulsa is in a unique position to be within a century of the event. ### Children, grandchildren and great-children may have diaries, letters, photos or other documents mentioning the massacre tucked away in attics, spare rooms or garages. ### This family history is also Tulsa’s history. ### This reluctance among families to discuss the sins — or lack of action — by their forefathers and foremothers has been an obstacle in other racial efforts, said Franklin, recently retired as the senior manager of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. He spent nearly 30 years with the Smithsonian Institution. ### In recent years, descendants of slave owners and their slaves have met at the plantations to learn from each other. ### The family of America’s largest slave-trading company made a documentary about a decade ago exploring the role of their ancestors and how that impacts their lives (“Traces of the Trade: A Story from the Deep North” by Katrina Browne). ### The connections were easier to make because of meticulous business record keeping. The challenge in Tulsa has been in decades of avoidance and attempted cover-ups. ### “When we’re dealing with reconciliation on slavery, the families who owned slaves know and will acknowledge they were slave owners. That is what is missing in the Tulsa situation,” Franklin said. “There has only been the discussion of survivors. ### “If you don’t have other voices, it has no context. As African Americans, we learn from both sides.” ### Franklin is the son of historian John Hope Franklin and grandson of B.C. Franklin, both Tulsa Race Massacre survivors. His father wrote the definitive African American history, and his grandfather was a noted attorney who brought lawsuits on behalf of black Tulsans after the massacre. ### A 1931 manuscript from B.C. Franklin is on display at the national African American museum. In lush prose, he describes private planes dropping turpentine bombs, a lack of first responders and smoke from buildings destroyed by arson. ### Tulsa is one of 10 cities featured in the museum. Among the exhibit items are melted pennies from a home fire, looted church property and postcards showing charred corpses. ### In seeing what black Tulsans kept, Franklin is convinced more has yet to be uncovered. ### What was left by the mayor, city and county commissioners and other government leaders? Did religious leaders leave notes from sermons given at the time? ### Who owned private planes back then? Who could have cut the phone lines? What were the thoughts and actions of firefighters and police officers? What did average citizens think or do? ### “That will shed light on the silence on the white Tulsa side,” he said. “There is a set of knowledge being kept away from public. Who were all the players in Tulsa in 1921 and what were they doing? I don’t see that kind of investigation going on. ### “We will move forward, but we don’t have all the vantage points from the past. Some are hidden from us, and we need to know more.” ### The 100th anniversary of the Red Summer is this year, which refers to the more than three dozen cities with race riots resulting in more than 165 deaths. Most of the victims were black. ### Many attacks were on black veterans of the Civil War and World War I. Sparks for the riots included claims of attack on white women and a fear of black labor unions. These took place from Arizona through Washington, D.C. ### It set the stage for Tulsa’s massacre. ### As an international speaker on African American history and reconciliation, Franklin said foreign audiences are often struck by Tulsa’s massacre: the notion of a community turning on itself. ### “This story may be viewed as one of Tulsa or Oklahoma — a local story,” he said. “But it’s a story that resonates nationally and worldwide. … It’s not a story of violence alone, but a story of resilience because people rebuilt on the ashes.” ### Groups are planning memorials for the Tulsa massacre’s centennial, including expansions of the Greenwood Cultural Center and outdoor monuments at the historic Vernon African Methodist Episcopal Church. ### The city of Tulsa is funding a search for possible mass burial sites — an effort overseen by a citizen commission. Franklin is a member of that group. ### For families finding bits of history, there are plenty of places for donation: Tulsa or Oklahoma historical societies or the Greenwood Cultural Center. Even providing copies of the documents or photos would be a boon. ### In encouraging Tulsa families to do this search, it doesn’t mean white residents should dictate or lead how history is preserved. ### It’s an opportunity to find missing pieces and offer reflection. ### “We are so used to having history in a single voice,” Franklin said. “We have to get to the point where history is mutli-vocal, giving people different vantage points for expressing themselves without being afraid to do so.” ### It’s hard to reconcile a beloved family member’s bad decisions or poor moral judgment. It’s more difficult when these are in historically prominent families. ### But, as we’ve experienced, secrets don’t always stay buried. ### “It’s courageous to approach it, but it has become courageous because it was suppressed for so long,” Franklin said. “With the denial of the past, then there is another level of devaluing of the past.” ### That is like when people argue slavery wasn’t that bad for all slaves. ### “It’s a different kind of dismissiveness than a denial. It’s more active than denial and an attitude that comes with it; fear, shame and embarrassment of family association with it,” Franklin said. ### Black Tulsans have put their experiences – and that of their family members — on public display. They have kept the memory of what happened alive and pushed for reforms including memorials and required teaching in schools. ### It’s time for an honest telling of the other side, the good and bad. ### “If not, how is reconciliation possible?” Franklin said. ### Subscribe to Daily Headlines ### Sign up!  ### Ginnie Graham 918-581-8376",60119,1,"“ This story may be viewed as one of Tulsa or Oklahoma — a local story,” he said. “ But it’s a story that resonates nationally and worldwide. … It’s not a story of violence alone, but a story of resilience because people rebuilt on the ashes. ”###Groups are planning memorials for the Tulsa massacre’s centennial, including expansions of the Greenwood Cultural Center and outdoor monuments at the historic Vernon African Methodist Episcopal Church.###The city of Tulsa is funding a search for possible mass burial sites — an effort overseen by a citizen commission.

In south Florida, where Hurricane Andrew caused devastation in 1992, few physical signs of damage remain. ### But on the Panhandle in tiny Mexico Beach, empty concrete slabs line streets where surfside homes used to be. Most of the cars, trucks and homes that were thrown into canals have been removed, but some remain. ### The scene isn't much different in Panama City, which thousands of residents left after Michael and still haven't returned. Blue roof tarps are everywhere, as are campers where people live in front of gutted homes.

32831,"“Sorry?” ### “Salisbury,” a woman behind him calls out softly. ### I’m certain there’s been some mistake, that they are mistaking me for an earl. Or, at the very least, a pretty mediocre ground steak preparation. So I declare my own last name louder; I really put an exclamation point on it. The woman, and the two attendants at her side, reassure me, urge me to step up onto the train, to turn left at the passageway and get on with the business of the journey. “Salisbury,” they say unreassuringly. ### “Which room is it then?” I ask. “Are you giving me a key?” ### “There are no keys,” the woman says. ### “The cabins have no numbers,” says another. ### “Look for the Salisbury cabin,” says the third. “That’s the one for you.” ### No keys. No cabin numbers. It feels confounding. So, turn left, and just like that, step into the dark folds of train travel in decades long past. It sure isn’t today. ### Rovos has the old-world charms of rail travel down pat. ### Tom Chiarella ### I’m on a golf safari, a blisteringly luxurious piece of fantasy travel offered by the Rovos Rail Company, which sends their restored Pullmans out on trips all over South Africa and up the continent as far as Tanzania. This nine-day trip features a massive 2,100-kilometer loop throughout eastern South Africa, five rounds of golf on superior courses set at distant points on the landscape, and a game drive or two in the world’s greatest national wildlife preserves. Mountains. Grasslands. Farmland. And yes, jungles. This ranging in price from $7,200 to $9,400 per person (double occupancy), plus airfare. ### No televisions on the train. No radio. No Wi-Fi. No cell phone use permitted, except in your cabin. Minibar. Daily laundry service. Vitally strong air-conditioning. Every cabin has a roomy bathroom en suite. Some have bathtubs. ### Coat and tie required at dinner, which turns out to be pretty cool because no matter how well you put yourself together, it’s hard to live up to the nightly four-course offering of delicately plated food—freshwater lobster, breast of ostrich, duck confit, antelope—and a four-bottle wine flight of excellent, promptly served South African wines, followed by aperitif. ### There are afternoon lectures in the observation car by the cultural historian who leads the game drives and market visits, and surprisingly sharp swing analysis offered by the young South African golf professional who travels in our midst, using footage taken on the course the day prior. He’s a handsome, ruddy guy, who handles transporting the golf bags in the early morning, making them ready for the passengers’ arrival, setting the pairings, tallying the scores, providing prizes for daily competitions given at the end of lunches in the clubhouse. ### The train manager, an icy-calm forty-something woman named Daphne, visits with every table each night to update the schedule, deliver the weather for the next day, news of the track condition for the night ahead, or simply to share a glass of vino now and again. Beyond that, the wine steward is aces-up. The servers, first class. Every cabin has an assigned attendant, who makes the bed, folds your clothes, provides extra blankets, and brings an orange soda and some crisps to your cabin when you need them late at night. There’s even a pretty sweet smoking lounge. ### Other than that, it’s rough-trade, fend-for-yourself travel, not for the weak of heart and so forth, with the needless warnings inserted here for a measure of humor and/or modesty. No, the golf safari is a gorgeous thing, in every aspect, perhaps most of all the reassuring breadth of the humanity encountered, on the train and on the course. ### Royal Swazi is a feast of fairways and foliage. The friends you make on a trip like this—including the farmer and the author—are unforgettable, too. ### Courtesy of Revos Rail Tours ### The golf is strictly African, though. Regal in presentation, ambitious in design, the courses are sometimes rough in their upkeep, in need of lengthening to meet up with new technology. They seem a bit forgotten, at times. But come on. You’re in Africa. My God, elephants walk here. Giraffes. Monkeys live in the trees near the halfway houses. Maybe you don’t like the slight sidehill drift of the tee box, or greens that are gummy and a smidgen gone to seed. Africa, fool. Every day here arrives like a telegram from a time you never saw in the first place. ### In a world where the largest warning sign on the course reads Mind Snakes in four-foot-high letters, controlling the environment feels anachronistic at best. But the mind does snake during African golf, across ancient neural pathways of fight vs. flight. At the Lost City course at the Sun City Resort, on our first day out, I stumbled upon an 18-foot crocodile curled up like a couch in the sun, not three feet of jaw-snap between him and my glossy-white ProV1. Flight, my friends. Flight. ### Coming off a long flight (a direct one from the States runs as long as 16 and a half hours) and a half day’s travel by train, Lost City is a good starting point for the bleary traveler. I came out slow, stepping right off our shuttle bus and onto the first tee. Mine was the senior caddie on the course, a wiry, 65-year-old black man who kept a brisk pace and humbly begged my playing partners to stay out of the rocks while looking for balls. Early on, he convinced me to stay on the grass. “We have black mambas,” he said. “And puff adders.” ### “No cobras?” I asked. ### “Yes, cobras,” he snapped. “This is Africa— yes, cobras. Of course, cobras.” ### He and I fell into typical conversation as he guided me through the round. He had two young children. Being a caddie is easier now than it was under apartheid, when he was routinely cuffed for giving a faulty read on a putt. He asked about my life. I gave him my hat. “Africa is made of bone,” he told me near the end. “A layer of vegetables, then soil, beneath that diamonds and metal. And coal. But then there is a skeleton.” ### He seemed perfectly certain that the world sprung from bone. “Just like the Bible,” he said, as I tipped him out. “Just like the rib of the Adam.” He held up a white tee, as if it were an illustration of his point. I can’t say I know what he meant. ### Getting there isn’t easy, but New Zealand is one of few places that exceeds its hype ### ADVERTISEMENT ### There are 39 passengers on the train. All of them are couples. Four from the UK, six from Sweden, one from Belgium, two from the United States, one from Denmark—and me. There are five French couples, traveling together, who don’t speak English, which seems to irritate the Belgians at first. But the French keep to themselves, and I often sit with them on the back of the bus, because I can tell when they are talking about me. Turns out, they are kind. ### By my tally, among the men and women are one diamond broker, one former professional volleyball player, one retired farmer from England, one staff member from the architectural program at Stanford, one supermarket owner from France, a mechanical engineer from Edinburgh, a risk manager from Sweden, a golf promoter from Sweden, one guy who claimed to have been a craps dealer, a sports writer, an insurance agent and a professor, two lawyers and a political activist. They are a symphony of impossibly musical names. Peer and Conny. Rolf and Annica. Didier and Natacha. Bo and Ulla Marie-Anne. Johan and Carine. Another Johan and Lally. ### In many ways this trip is like a cruise, a journey outward with a fixed cast, friendly competitions by day, dinner seating, followed by recounting and recantings over drinks by night. But it is, in measure, far more of a physical test. ### The train, for all its comforts, will get you. It sits for long periods in freight yards. Much of the transit from one city to the next occurs at night, while passengers sleep, or try to. At its best, the movement of the train is soothing, rhythmic, something like the way it looks in old movies. That’s a fierce illusion, because at its worst, the night passage is a real racket. Some nights it’s like sleeping inside a rooftop air-conditioning unit. With a bent fan blade. Soon, already jet-lagged passengers admit they are getting by on a supply of Ambien, or not sleeping at all. ### When the movement of the train wakes me, I settle for sitting up alongside the window, looking into the darkness as one platinum mine or another cascades into the increasing distance. I remind myself: I’m looking at Africa, its spare streetlights, its inky-black mountains, its gaping sky with ancient stars I’ve never seen before. It’s 3:00 a.m. in Africa, I tell myself. I can be happy to look into the distance as if this world has something to do with me. ### But I do not sleep. ### Champagne Sports Resort in KwaZulu-Natal. ### Courtesy of Revos Rail Tours ### The most surprisingly beautiful course on the trip? The Champagne Sports Resort Course, in KwaZulu-Natal, a 6,694-meter, gorgeously bunkered parkland track that grips the rolling hills in the central Drakensberg mountain range as if it were formed there. From KwaZulu-Natal, we rolled out to Durban, for a round at the Durban Country Club, which sits wedged between the city and the coastal highway. The course is heavily arbored, sculpted from sand and situated on a rise above the highway, so the ocean is what you see. At best, it’s a challenging championship course (17-time home to the South African Open Championship), and at the other extreme it’s a wonderful example of urban golf, sitting proudly beneath the mantle of Durban’s massive rugby stadium. Oddly, the course claims that its signature hole—the difficult, 464-meter, par-5 third—is rated the “best third hole” in the world. I can’t make much of that. ### On the morning we are to head into Swaziland to play Royal Swazi (a rough-and-tumble, 6,166- meter layout nestled inside the tiny nation), my friend John Boyd, the British farmer, tells me I turned in a bit too early the night before. Missed some real excitement. “My wife and I had a bit of a row with another British couple over Brexit,” he says. ### In that moment, it occurs to me that I haven’t heard a single word about the American president in more than five days. Another blessing of this train. John is still aghast. “They are full-blown Departers, it turns out. And they claimed a rise in knife crime was due to the influx of Romanians! What nonsense! Naturally, Linda wasn’t having that. We employed hundreds of Romanians in our fruit business. Without exception, they were educated, motivated workers. And taxpayers, Tom.” ### I offer my sympathy. Later, I check in with the Departers. “People are so afraid of different ideas,” the husband says to me at that evening’s black-tie party. (We are supposed to be dressed like Gatsby. He’s wearing a golf shirt, pinched around his neck with a multicolored bow tie.) “You can’t ever get away from home, can you?” ### The last stop for Rovos’s high-handicap railroaders is Leopard Creek, which is South Africa's best track. ### Tom Chiarella ### But you can. Eight days in, we end the golf at Leopard Creek, where the greens suddenly run true on the toughest-to-get-on course of our journey. It’s a 1996 Gary Player track— consider by many the finest course in all of South Africa—lovingly renovated by his close friend Jack Nicklaus many years later. Besides some particular rules about black socks (verboten), the course is an open though difficult test of golf for your sleepless correspondent. This is our “championship day,” and fine farmer John Boyd is leading my team. ### At one point, he sneaks ahead to a fence by a river, a vantage point looking down into Kruger National Park. I’m fussing over my putt, thinking a 12-footer might put the fix on a lousy round. John waves hard for me to join him at the river’s edge. “You must see this, Tom!” he calls. ### Thirty feet below us stand two hippos, up to their necks in the swiftly-running brown water. They are slick and, in my memory now, somehow pink—and they appear to be, for lack of a better word, frolicking. It’s the only word I can think of to describe their half leaps and head tilts. I have had dogs, wonderful best-friend kind of dogs, who could not express their happiness this well. ### I find myself speechless—the hippos, the river, the grassland, the distance. The happiness out here. John had told me he didn’t care for animals, so I don’t allow him to see that I have tears in my eyes. True! What a sap. Over two hippos. And their baby—the size of a large pig, standing in the shallows. ### I find myself speechless—the hippos, the river, the grassland, the distance. The happiness out here.

77206,"Metro/State ### Obama Foundation brings together city’s future leaders to tackle issues with fresh ideas ### The group of young adults will network and work on a group project they are passionate about to make improvements in their communities. ### Participants hold a discussion in a partner activity during the Obama Foundation’s leadership program. ### Nader Issa/Sun-Times ### A group of 130 young Chicagoans started a six-month journey Saturday in an Obama Foundation program meant to empower and connect the city’s next generation of leaders. ### The participants selected for the Community Leadership Corps are all between 18 and 25 years old and passionate about make equitable improvements in their city, an Obama Foundation official said. ### Gathered for the first time at the program’s two-day kickoff event at Roosevelt University in the Loop, the group learned about recognizing their own biases and designing community improvements with the needs of all residents in mind. ### Along with three in-person training sessions and a few more online, the program’s participants will work in teams over the next few months to complete a group project tackling an issue important to them in their community. ### A participant takes notes at the start of the Obama Foundation’s leadership program. ### Nader Issa/Sun-Times ### Aliyah Jervier, 23, is a Loyola University alumna now working as a program assistant with Arabella Advisors, which helps guide companies in their philanthropic efforts. In her free time, Jervier works with Edgewater Kids United, an after-school program for students in the North Side neighborhood. ### Jervier, a Rogers Park resident, said the program could give her the tools and connections she needs to keep influencing her community. ### “I’m excited for the networking opportunity,” she said. “I want to see how I can collaborate with people, because I know when we all put our own unique initiatives together, we can make something greater than what we already have.” ### Fittingly, Jervier immediately connected with 25-year-old Nick Tarleton, who’s interested in reducing childhood obesity in low-income communities. ### Tarleton comes from a food science background and works for the Kraft Heinz Company as a business process analyst. He said he wants to find the people in his community already making an impact and work with them toward change. ### “For me, I want to teach people how to prepare nutritious meals in the comfort of their own homes,” Tarleton said. ### Through the program, he hoped to find others who match his passion, but have more business and communications acumen. ### Participants in the Obama Foundation’s Community Leadership Corps meet for the first time Saturday at Roosevelt University. ### Nader Issa/Sun-Times ### Operating in its second year in Chicago, the Obama Foundation program spurred initiatives in the city with last year’s participants — like the one by 25-year-old Alex Perez-Garcia. ### “I was really excited a year ago to have the opportunity to work on a distinct project that I’m really passionate about, which was around mental health and people of color,” Perez-Garcia said. “As a person who identifies as a person of color who has mental illness, it was a really personal project and turned into a passion.” ### Yaritza Sandoval, 25, was another one of last year’s participants. Sandoval works with a nonprofit called Cradles to Crayons, which provides essential items like shoes, clothing, diapers and books to families with young children. ### Sandoval used to tutor Chicago Public Schools students, but quickly realized she was one of the only tutors of color working with a group made up of almost entirely students of color. For her project, Sandoval helped a tutoring organization in Austin implement an educational curriculum that more closely connected to the students’ backgrounds. ### “The idea was, ‘How do we co-create educational curriculum that’s culturally relevant with students?’” Sandoval said. “It was such an amazing experience of creating something with the community that I feel I’m a part of.” ### Next Up In News",60119,1,"The participants selected for the Community Leadership Corps are all between 18 and 25 years old and passionate about make equitable improvements in their city, an Obama Foundation official said.###Gathered for the first time at the program ’s two-day kickoff event at Roosevelt University in the Loop, the group learned about recognizing their own biases and designing community improvements with the needs of all residents in mind.###Along with three in-person training sessions and a few more online, the program’s participants will work in teams over the next few months to complete a group project tackling an issue important to them in their community.###A participant takes notes at the start of the Obama Foundation’s leadership program.###Nader Issa/Sun-Times","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]","<p>The participants selected for the Community Leadership Corps are all between 18 and 25 years old and passionate about make equitable improvements in their city, an Obama Foundation official said.</p><p>Gathered for the first time at the program ’s two-day kickoff event at Roosevelt University in the Loop, the group learned about recognizing their own biases and designing community improvements with the needs of all residents in mind.</p><p>Along with three in-person training sessions and a few more online, the program’s participants will work in teams over the next few months to complete a group project tackling an issue important to them in their community.</p><p>A participant takes notes at the start of the Obama Foundation’s leadership program.</p><p>Nader Issa/Sun-Times</p>",722

LOUIS (AP) — Missouri has at least temporarily avoided becoming the first state without a functioning abortion clinic since 1974, the year after the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. ### A St. Louis judge on Friday intervened on behalf of a Planned Parenthood clinic there that is at odds with state regulators who are refusing to renew the facility's license to perform abortions. The license was set to expire effective Saturday. ### The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Service cited patient safety concerns and said it wanted to talk to several clinic doctors. Planned Parenthood said two staff doctors agreed to interviews, but that others who are contractors or no longer work at the clinic would not talk. ### A look at some of the key questions surrounding the potential closure of Missouri's only abortion clinic: ### ——— ### HOW DID IT GET TO THIS POINT? ### Missouri law requires an annual inspection of abortion clinics. The inspection in St. Louis was in March. ### The health department cited several deficiencies, including ""at least one incident in which patient safety was gravely compromised."" It also cited what it called ""failed surgical abortions in which women remained pregnant,"" and an alleged failure to obtain ""informed consent."" ### At a hearing before Judge Michael Stelzer on Thursday, Planned Parenthood attorney Jamie Boyer said the seven deficiencies have been ""remedied,"" but the license is threatened unless the non-staff physicians agree to be interviewed. Boyer said Planned Parenthood can't force people who aren't on staff to cooperate. ### Assistant Attorney General John Sauer told the judge that any doctor who has performed an abortion should be made available for the investigation. ### ——— ### WHAT DOES THE JUDGE'S FRIDAY RULING MEAN? ### The clinic can continue to perform abortions for now. The judge issued a temporary restraining order that prohibits the state from taking away the clinic's license to perform abortions. The license will remain in effect at least until the judge issues a ruling on Planned Parenthood's request for a permanent injunction. A hearing is set for Tuesday morning. ### × ### ——— ### WHERE ELSE DO MISSOURI WOMEN GET ABORTIONS? ### Some Missouri residents already must travel hundreds of miles to get an abortion. Closure of the St. Louis clinic would mean they might have to go farther, but not much: The Hope Clinic for Women performs abortions in Granite City, Illinois, 10 miles (16 kilometers) from St. Louis. ### For people in the western half of the state, the closest option is Planned Parenthood's Abortion Services clinic in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri, just 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the state line. ### About 3,300 of the 7,000 abortions performed in Kansas last year were for Missouri residents, according to Kansas' health department. Information provided by the state of Missouri shows that at least 48 percent of Missourians who received abortions in 2017, the most recent data available, did so in another state. But the percentage is almost certainly higher because some states, including Illinois, don't provide the data. ### Subscribe to Breaking News ### Sign up!  ### A small number of Missouri hospitals also perform abortions. Figures provided by the state show 62 abortions at hospitals last year — 52 of them at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. So far in 2019, 24 abortions have been performed at hospitals, 21 at Barnes-Jewish. ### ———",60119,1,"The health department cited several deficiencies, including ""at least one incident in which patient safety was gravely compromised.

52937,"TV Review: ‘Perpetual Grace, LTD.’ on Epix ### news 1 hour ago Variety — Daniel D'Addario ### MGM-owned premium cable network Epix has, for a few years, been working to define itself as an outlet for original programming. Their latest attempt, “Perpetual Grace, LTD.,” seeks the audience’s favor by cloaking itself both the familiar. The show’s cast includes familiar faces like Jimmi Simpson of “Westworld,” Terry O’Quinn of “Lost,” and Oscar nominees Sir Ben Kingsley and Jacki Weaver; its giddy amorality-in-the-American-sticks formula seems borrowed from “Ozark,” which itself owes a debt to “Breaking Bad.” (Both that late-2000s noir and this one, a decade later, are set in the deserts of New Mexico, which feels like no coincidence.) Little here feels new, and it’s not a skillful enough pastiche to demand you find Epix on your dial. ### Simpson plays a con artist who seeks to ensnare a pair of religious leaders who seem like easy marks; he plans to have them kidnapped so that he can pretend to be their son and enrich himself with their life insurance. While Simpson’s James easily meshes into this couple’s lives (aided by their actual son, a floundering ne’er-do-well played by Damon Herriman) he comes to discover that the pastor and his wife are more formidable than he’d initially believed. ### All of which makes for the outset of a compelling enough noir, if one indebted, too, to “Fargo” — but the telling is all. “Perpetual Grace” relies on lugubrious and lengthy flashbacks shot in black-and-white, so exaggeratedly haunted that heavy-handed veins of quirk, when they surface, seem less like counterpoint and more like jarring, unpleasant contrast. And Kingsley’s Pastor Brown is so obviously containing sociopathic multitudes, thanks to a performance with little shading over its tough, aggressive venom, that the story lacks suspense. ### “Perpetual Grace” is a shot at accomplishing something that’s been accomplished already, many times, elsewhere: Launching a dark antihero drama in which the concept of self-interest is practically a character itself. But familiarity breeds contempt, particularly when what’s familiar is contempt — the sneering, preening tone struck by characters distinguished by nastiness and little more. To find the next “Breaking Bad” — which is to say, the next drama that breaks out in a big way — networks should start by building shows that look nothing like “Breaking Bad” at all. ### “Perpetual Grace, LTD.” Epix.

Winds SSW at 5 to 10 mph. ### Updated: June 1, 2019 @ 11:51 pm ### Newcastle priest blessing farmers' fields at planting time ### NICK HYTREK  Sioux City Journal ### Jun 1, 2019 ### Save ### NEWCASTLE, Neb. | All through the spring, summer and fall, farmers keep at least one eye on the sky. ### They look for breaks in cloudy spring skies that will allow the sun to warm and dry the soil for planting. They watch summer storm fronts roll in, hoping that gathering clouds bring needed rain and not damaging winds or hail. ### For the past five years, the Rev. Andy Sohm has helped northeast Nebraska farmers look beyond the clouds for help with a bountiful crop. ### The pastor at St. Peter Catholic Church in Newcastle, St. Joseph in Ponca and St. Patrick in Jackson, Sohm has taken God's blessings to his parishioners' fields, reviving an old Catholic ritual of blessing fields and seeds at planting time. He'll also return at harvest, if asked, to bless the crops. ### A farm kid from Danbury, Iowa, Sohm knew from experience that divine intervention, in addition to favorable weather conditions, plays an important role from planting through harvest. ### ""Having grown up on a farm, I realized and recognized all you need, the stress and pressure, and the need for the Lord,"" Sohm said. ""I think it's extremely important to put our trust in the Lord."" ### When he was assigned to the parishes in Ponca and Newcastle five years ago (Jackson was added a year ago), Sohm decided that reintroducing the crop-blessing ritual was not only a way to help farmers realize their faith, but also to meet and connect with parishioners. ### ""It's a good way to connect with families rather than let them come my way,"" said Sohm, who was ordained in 2005. ""I was fascinated, too, because farming has changed so much since I was on the farm."" ### Sohm's ministry led him over the muddy roads in rural Newcastle recently to the farms of Chad Kneifl and his parents, Sy and Ellen Kneifl, who together plant 2,200 acres in corn and soybeans. ### Inside the machine shop at Chad Kneifl's farm sat bags of seed corn and the planter, waiting for the fields to dry out so planting could begin. As Sohm pulled out his prayer book and set a container of holy water on the floor, Chad and Sy Kneifl took off their hats and, along with Ellen, folded their hands. ### After an opening prayer and scripture reading, Sohm prayed an Our Father with the Kneifls and concluded with a prayer that began with the words, ""Lord of the harvest, you place the gift of creation in our hands and called us to till the earth and make it fruitful. We ask your blessing as we prepare these seeds and the earth. May the care we show these seeds remind us of your tender care for your people."" ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### Sohm sprinkled holy water on the bags of seed and the planter, then went to Sy and Ellen Kneifl's farm to repeat the blessing on the soybean seed. ### It's a ritual the Kneifls believe in, one that Sy remembers from years ago, when farmers would take a sample of their seed to town each spring for the priest to bless. Yes, they've had dry years, hail and other challenges, but Sy believes the blessing is as important as rain and fertilizer. ### ""Last year we had an excellent crop. That doesn't happen every year,"" he said. ### Subscribe to Breaking News ### Sign up!  ### It's probably safe to say that farmers offer prayers throughout the growing season until the crops are in the bin. The blessing is another way to seek God's help for a good harvest and protection from flooding, drought and hail, Ellen Kneifl said. ### ""It's very important to us,"" she said. ""We've always had a lot of faith. We have to. There are so many things that can happen."" ### Sohm said he'd like to see the blessing, once common, become more widespread again. It's a good reminder not only to him, but to the people he serves, that there's a higher power looking over them and their fields. ### ""Together we're putting our trust not in man, but in God,"" he said. ### Sharing that blessing, that trust, Sohm said, is a glorious experience. ### ""It's helped me grow closer to God, and it's a real blessing for me to bless this seed. I feel the blessing of the Lord to be able to do this,"" he said. ""It's really the blessings of the people. I do it for the people."" ### By doing so, Sohm's spreading God's blessings to the crops and fields vital to each farmer's way of life. ### As those seeds sprout, take root and grow stronger, so does their faith. ### Subscribe to Breaking News ### Sign up!  ### You must be logged in to react. ### Click any reaction to login. ### Love",60119,1,Don't have an account?

Hendricks and Sons. ### “In the last 25 years, I think we’ve worked with over 70 school districts all over Michigan,” Hendricks said. “So, you think you’re excited — I’m as excited about this project. This is by far the most exciting K-12 project that we’ve ever had.” ### Hendricks said the auditorium and Innovation Center are scheduled to be completed by the beginning of the 2019-20 school year. The weight room will be ready this November and the Legacy Center is slated to be finished by July 2020. ### Finally, the crowd heard from Superintendent Brian Keim. ### “As we look around us, we see many symbols of what makes the Laker community so special,” Keim said. “To our west, we see an expansive campus that serves over 900 students each day and thousands of others that have started their educations in these classrooms and then have gone on to do great things literally all over the world. To our east, we see long stretches of fields that remind us of the farmers that remain the lifeblood of our community.” ### “To our distant north we see the wind turbines,” he added. “Those wind turbines stand as symbols of advancement in technology and they remind us that we are in an unprecedented time of change, rapid change and development and that we must prepare students for a life of rapid growth and change accordingly. To our near north, we see athletic fields where students work and compete to learn valuable lessons about life and team.” ### Keim went on to thank the Laker community for supporting the bond’s passing. ### “Today’s groundbreaking ceremony is a salute to the Laker community, for all the support you’ve given us for past generations,” he said. “But, it is also a salute to those who understood that great institutions must not be content with past success. Our community understood that change is inevitable, and growth is essential, so they supported us in passing this next generation bond proposal.” ### The bond proposal will create a new parking area, renovated halls and floors at the elementary building, updated classrooms, locker rooms and air handling systems at the junior high, and a renovated auditorium, an innovation center, new locker rooms, weight room and an updated gym at the high school. ### The football complex will feature a new track, new lighting and new visitor’s bleachers with a lighted and paved walk path. ### “All of these things will come together to make our campus one of the greatest campuses anywhere in the state, particularly for a rural school, in a small community like ours,” Keim said. “All of these new facilities and renovations would mean nothing without the staff and students that will breathe life into them. New buildings are just brick and mortar.

After a successful morning, you’re thinking about packing up early and getting home before lunch. ### Suddenly, your pole snaps down and your reel starts screaming. You tighten the drag, but the powerful fish is gone within seconds, biting through your six-pound test monofilament like a spaghetti noodle. ### If something like this has ever happened to you, you might’ve had a run-in with the elusive tiger muskie . A hybrid cross between a northern pike and a muskie, they get their name from the vertical stripes that adorn their sides. Tiger muskies are the closest thing to barracudas that we have in Utah . Shaped like torpedoes, they attack with ferocious speed, and the largest specimens exceed 50 inches in length. ### Here are five of the best spots in the Beehive State to target these unique fish. ### Pineview Reservoir ### Located in Ogden Valley, Pineview Reservoir is considered by many to be the crown jewel of Utah tiger muskie fishing. The current state record , a 49-incher caught in 2006, came from these waters. Ditto for the catch and release record , a 53-incher landed in 1998. The reservoir can get crowded in the summer, but if you stick to the shorelines, Pineview is a prime place to hunt for a trophy. ### Newton Reservoir ### This small reservoir in Cache Valley has a surface area under 300 acres when full. It’s home to bluegill, perch, sunfish, rainbow trout, and tiger muskies. Though the tiger muskies in Newton haven’t quite reached the massive sizes found in Pineview, there are still numerous specimens caught each year that exceed 40 inches. ### Joes Valley Reservoir ### Many anglers flock to Joes Valley in search of splake. These trout are hybrid, like tiger muskies, and can reach up to 16 pounds. The current Utah catch and release record for splake was caught here in 2017. But tigers also call Joes Valley home, and they’ve been known to shock many an angler by aggressively striking lures and jigs intended for other species. ### Fish Lake ### Utah’s largest mountain lake is also one of the prettiest. It’s long been known for Mackinaw, but in recent years, tiger muskies stocked in nearby Johnson Reservoir have traveled upstream and set up shop in Fish Lake. While there isn’t an abundance of tigers here, they grow big due to the favorable conditions. The current Utah spearfishing record for tiger muskie, a 46-incher, was set in Fish Lake in 2013. ### Johnson Reservoir ### Often overlooked because of its close proximity to Fish Lake, this sometimes-muddy reservoir still has a lot to offer. First of all, you can usually enjoy solitude while fishing here — a nearly impossible feat at Pineview or Joes Valley. Additionally, there’s a solid population of tiger muskies in Johnson that can reach trophy sizes. ### Where do you go to fish tiger muskies?

The one that generated backlash from Householder, R-Glenford, and others in social-media circles focused on tutorials for drag queen makeup. ### The Delaware County Library District also announced earlier in the week that it was canceling an hour-long class, “Drag 101,” that had been scheduled for June 5. After some teens in the community requested it, the program was to focus on the theatrical elements of the art form, for those ages 12 to 17. ### Householder wrote that when he first heard of libraries being used to host drag queen educational programing for teens, he thought it was a joke. ### “This is a stunningly bizarre breach of the public trust. And it must stop,” Householder wrote Friday in a letter to the Ohio Library Council. ### “Our libraries are an incubator for thought and ideas, for debate and discussion. On this point, we all can agree. But I can also assure you the taxpayers aren’t interested in seeing their hard-earned dollars being used to teach teenage boys how to become drag queens. I expect this to end immediately.” ### Library officials took the warning seriously, particularly considering its timing, written as the House and Senate prepare to pass the new two-year state operating budget by the end of June. that budget includes more than $400 million per year for a state library system that has traditionally been one of the best funded in the nation. ### On Saturday, eight House Democrats from Franklin County issued a joint statement, calling Householder’s comments “unfortunate.” ### “It now appears another Library system is shutting down its PRIDE programming because of the furor this statement created,” said the release, signed by Reps. Kristin Boggs of Columbus, Richard Brown of Canal Winchester, Erica Crawley of Columbus, David Leland of Columbus, Mary Lightbody of Westerville, Dr. Beth Liston of Dublin, Adam Miller of Columbus and Allison Russo of Upper Arlington. ### “Let’s be clear, the promise of America is not that we all agree on everything, but that we all agree to let everyone have their voice. That is certainly true for the nearly 500,000 LGBTQ Ohioans. At a time when the national political discourse has reached new lows, let us in Ohio embrace our diversity so that all can flourish,” the release said. ### Householder, whose district includes about half of Licking County, posted his letter on Facebook and Twitter, where it generated robust discussion. He started out affirming his defense of the First Amendment and libraries, but added, “I also believe in common sense.” ### George Needham, director of the Delaware County District Library, chose to cancel the event there after seeing hostile messages that appeared to threaten the library staff, patrons and the teens. It was rescheduled for this week at a bookstore. ### The Newark Ohio Pride Coalition noted that no public money was being used for its event, and stressed that it was aimed at “celebrating the individuality of our local LGBTQ+ and allied teens in preparation for the Newark Ohio Pride Festival on Saturday, June 8.” ### The makeup tutorial was optional, the coalition said, and the primary focus of the program “allows our local teenagers to celebrate their identities…” ### “We would like to conclude our statement by publicly asking Speaker Larry Householder to respect the civil liberties of Newark, Ohio’s residents. We also ask that, in the future, Speaker Householder take the time to gather accurate facts prior to issuing a factually inaccurate response to a program hosted by our community.”",60119,1,"“ Our libraries are an incubator for thought and ideas, for debate and discussion.

However, the firm had no role to play in securing the deal, the state capture commission of inquiry heard. ### The commission, chaired by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, on Friday heard evidence from Jonathan Bloom of MNS Attorneys. In 2018 the firm was asked to probe allegations of fraud and irregularities by Transnet's former board. The firm produced six investigative reports. Bloom provided evidence pertaining to one of the reports which he helped compile regarding the financing of Transnet's 1064 locomotive project. ### As far back as 2012, Transnet had tendered for manufacturers of 1 064 locomotives, needed to replace the ageing fleet and to bolster the fleet capacity to keep up with market demand, the inquiry previously heard. ### Subscribe to Fin24’s  newsletter here ### The project was to be financed with $1.5bn from the China Development Bank and R12bn was funded through a club loan from banks and financial institutions. The club loan was agreed to on November 23, 2015. Lenders of the club loan included the Bank of China, ABSA and Nedbank – each provided R3bn, and Old Mutual Finance and Futuregrowth each provided R1.5bn. ### But in his testimony, Bloom said there was a questionable sequence of events leading up to this point. ### A business associate of the Guptas, Salim Essa, in September 2015 became a controlling shareholder of Trillian. In October, Transnet's Board Acquisitions and Disposal Council approved a memorandum to replace JP Morgan as the lead arranger of the club loan. ### Another Gupta-linked firm, Regiments, was the supplier development partner of JP Morgan. ### Then, on November 18, 2015, just five days before the club loan was finalised, Transnet entered into an agreement that Trillian would be the lead arranger of the loan. Later that month, Trillian invoiced Transnet R93m for services it purportedly rendered as lead arranger of the club loan, Bloom said. ### Charges for work previously done ### However, Bloom told the commission that it was unlikely Trillian had done any work on the loan. ### ""The transaction advisory work charged for had already been performed by Regiments,"" Bloom said. ""The appointment of Trillian was irregular. Trillian was not the party that did the work, given the time periods involved,"" Bloom added. ### ""They were invoicing work they did not do and already had been done by Regiments,"" he reiterated. ### ""The R93m invoice submitted to Transnet by Trillian for advisory services for the transaction was fraudulent."" ### He also told the commission that Transnet did not require the services of Trillian, as Transnet's treasury had the expertise to facilitate such a loan. ### The inquiry will resume on Monday. ### Read more about:",60119,1,"As far back as 2012, Transnet had tendered for manufacturers of 1 064 locomotives, needed to replace the ageing fleet and to bolster the fleet capacity to keep up with market demand, the inquiry previously heard.###Subscribe to Fin24’s  newsletter here###The project was to be financed with $1.5bn from the China Development Bank and R12bn was funded through a club loan from banks and financial institutions.

Wilder fights for Premier Boxing Champions, which is aligned with Showtime and Fox, so the rematch could be a joint venture between ESPN and one of those networks, per the ESPN report. ###  ### Reach Cecil Hurt at cecil@tidesports.com or on Twitter at @cecilhurt.",60119,1,"The Wilder-Ortiz rematch in September in Los Angeles was announced earlier this week.

Adjustable waist a necessity (had a baby and body is in flux).  Cropped wide leg or joggers would be nice, but anything that isn't a skinny leg (too hot!) ### -Valora ### The answer is you need more like 5. My bonus point categories are pockets and materials. ### Reply ### Actually, I wonder how they did her hair--it's very obviously done, but still looks a lot more natural than a lot of other screen looks. ### Reply ### Original Poster1 point · 22 days ago ### I’ve been riding a rocker middle for a while now. I actually like the way it rides better than a straight up camber board. I’m seriously considering it. I’m just torn between the 146 or 148. My current board is a 147. ### 1 point · 22 days ago ### Then I definitely recommend the Aura! That's the choice I made anyways. I like the additional playfulness, but will add I am very capable of keeping my balance/edge in ice. I would size up to the 148 if you're happy with your current board size! I assume you're coming from a slightly shorter all-mountain (and softer) board. I went to the Aura for stability at speeds and the stiffness/edge to hold a carve, but specifically for a rocker middle to make it more fun to do so. I will say if you want to do a lot of park, you may want to consider buying another board as well. ### Reply ### Original Poster1 point · 22 days ago ### I stay far away from the park. The trees however... ### This is where I’m confused. Comparing the specs on Evo, the Rome SDS Gold has a very stiff rating while Evo is telling me the Aura has only a stiff rating. When I tested the Aura out west I believe I was riding a 151/152 and that felt a tad too big. (Side note, my Burton Anti-Social split is also a 147(which i know is short for western backcountry powder, but works fine on the east). Back to the Aura, I know it’s only a cm difference on either side, but if I’m looking for groomers, trees, and all around in bound skiing, would it still be better to size up to the 148 or size down to the 146 because it’s a less stiff board? ### Sorry for all the questions! Honestly if I could just buy another Rome Gold board I would. I’m completely in love with the way my board handles all conditions, it’s just nearing the end of its lifespan and I’d rather keep it in tact for those perfect once in a while blue bird fun days instead of letting it fall to pieces. I’m already scared to get it sharpened because it’s being held together with marine glue in some places (all cosmetic, not structural) ### 1 point · 22 days ago ### So I'm not actually pulling up consistent information on that Rome SNS Gold board. Some sources are telling me it's mid-firm, and some are saying it's firm. I'm actually wondering why some of the sources are classifying it as an all-mountain freestyle board? That said, from a quick google, it looks like the shaping on the Gold is more of a traditional rocker board. Have you tried a Never Summer Lady West? Because looking at the profile of the Gold, you might enjoy that one more. It might have more in common with the Gold. A 152 (Auras are even numbers) would handle significantly differently than an 148 would. The Aura isn't a park board though, so I wouldn't recommend sizing down unless you're sure you'd prefer it. (I personally do like longer boards because they balance out my height.) Quite frankly, I wouldn't buy a snowboard I didn't specifically love. If you can, then maybe test out the Burton Feelgood Flying V from this year? They did change it, and while it's not quite as stiff as my NS Aura, it might be more of what you're looking for. Honestly, if you have for the foot-size for it, you may want to consider men's boards. It seems like you're looking for a very specific combination and they have more variety on offer?

Kelly ### Matt Marton / AP ### Associated Press ### CHICAGO — ### Prosecutors aren’t saying much about why they charged R. Kelly with 11 new sex-related felony counts but one thing is clear: Things are much more serious for the Grammy-winning R&B singer. ### The reasons start with the fact that the 11 new counts include four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault — a Class X felony that carries a sentence up to 30 years — more than four times as long as the sentence that each of the 10 counts Kelly was charged with and pleaded not guilty to in February. ### “By doing this they have enhanced the penalty if he’s convicted,” Joe Lopez, a Chicago defense attorney, said Friday. And perhaps more significantly, he said that even with the original 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse that Kelly was charged with in February there was a possibility that he could have been placed on probation and avoided prison. ### But, Lopez said, if Kelly is convicted of any one of the four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault, he must go to prison. ### Of more immediate concern to Kelly might be what happens when he returns to court next Thursday to hear the new charges. ### “I would not be surprised at all if prosecutors come to court and ask the judge to increase the bail amount,” said Dick Devine, a private attorney who was the Cook County State’s Attorney for a dozen years until 2008. Any substantial increase could send Kelly back to jail. Kelly, whose financial problems have been widely reported, spent a few days behind bars when he was originally charged in February until a suburban woman posted the 10% of $1 million bond — $100,000 — to secure his release. ### But various legal experts say there is not much chance of prosecutors asking for such an increase or a judge granting that request if they do. ### Kelly’s attorney, Steve Greenberg, said he is optimistic that the bail mount won’t be increased. ### “He’s not a flight risk and (while) they may have changed the charges it doesn’t change the fact that he’s not a flight risk and we expect bail to remain the same,” Greenberg said of Kelly. ### In the long term, one former federal prosecutor suggested that the new charges are likely part of a legal strategy to increase the chances of a conviction. ### “What happens is they charged the same thing in different ways because they obviously want to have the greatest chance at conviction and maybe they looked at the indictment and saw (Kelly’s attorneys) might have a defense and they wanted to seal off that defense,” said Phil Turner, who is now a Chicago defense attorney. ### According to the new court filing, the first eight counts are from encounters that allegedly occurred between Jan. 1 and Jan. 31, 2010. Three others pertain to alleged encounters between May 1, 2009, and Jan. 31, 2010. ### Among other things, prosecutors allege that Kelly used force or threatened to do so to pressure the accuser into sex or to perform oral sex on him. She was underage at the time, extending the statute of limitations for bringing charges to 20 years from her 18th birthday, they wrote. ### Since the new charges were announced, a woman has come forward to say publicly that 11 new sex-related felony counts against R. Kelly stem from allegations she made about the R&B singer. ### Jerhonda Pace writes on her Facebook page that she’s the alleged victim prosecutors identify as “J.P.” in court papers. Anticipating an angry reaction by Kelly’s fans, Pace — one of four women Kelly is charged with sexually abusing — wrote that “no matter how “wrong” you think I am, the law is on my side, a MINOR at the time.” ### The Associated Press doesn’t usually name alleged victims of sexual assault, but Pace has gone public with her allegations. ### The Cook County State’s Attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment for this story. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

93234,"More Articles ### June 01, 2019 ### Anyone who’s watched HGTV for more than five minutes has probably seen the identical smiling faces of Drew and Jonathan Scott. The Canadian twin brothers are two of the most recognizable hosts and their long-running series Property Brothers is one of the most beloved shows on the network. ### However, like so many home renovation shows, Property Brothers has come under fire for being way too staged. Fans love watching the befores turn into afters, but at the same time, they don’t appreciate seeing such unrealistic transformations play out on screen. ### How fake is Property Brothers? Read on to find out. ### Drew Scott and Jonathan Scott | Jason Davis/Getty Images for HGTV ### The drama on ‘Property Brothers’ is overplayed ### The first home tour on Property Brothers is always interesting. The idea behind it is simple: Drew Scott takes the prospective homebuyers on a tour of a house they can’t afford so they can bring their expectations back down to earth once they realize how much their “ dream home ” really costs. ### Even avid fans of the show act surprised when that first house winds up being way too expensive. As you’ve probably guessed already, this part is definitely staged and usually, homebuyers are aware that the first house they tour is out of their budget. Otherwise, why would they even be on the show? ### How do we know? For one thing, homebuyers only qualify to be on the show if they have at least $65,000 to spend on home renovations. Those people know that buying a perfect house that’s already done won’t be worth filming for Property Brothers. Also, every episode starts exactly the same way—anyone who’s seen one episode also knows the premise of the show. ### Sometimes the house hunting part is fake ### Most people realize that on the popular HGTV show House Hunters, the prospective home buyers aren’t touring homes they’re really considering . Instead, they are already under contract on a house when filming begins, so all the houses they go to see aren’t actually in the running. ### Same goes for Property Brothers. While the show makes it seem like people are starting from square one searching for their dream properties, in reality they’ve probably narrowed it down to a few options or may even have decided on a particular house already. ### “We have homeowners who have identified a house that they already like. Because everything moves so fast for the show, we have found that it doesn’t work well for people who haven’t even started searching,” Jonathan Scott told Popsugar. “It needs to be people who really have started to narrow down the stuff that’s important to them.” ### Jonathan Scott isn’t always the realtor ### Obviously if a couple already has a house under contract, it means they’re also working with a real estate professional. There are times when Jonathan steps in to do negotiations (if he’s licensed to sell houses in that state), but most of the home tours aren’t legit. ### Similarly, any person buying a home solo will always have a friend along so the episode isn’t boring. This so-called sidekick doesn’t serve any purpose besides making the dynamic more interesting. ### The whole house doesn’t get renovated ### A $65,000 home renovation budget sounds excessive, but in the world of contractors it doesn’t always stretch too far. You’ll probably notice that Jonathan Scott and his crew only tour certain parts of the house during the big reveal. The reason for that? Not everything gets renovated, and showing all the rooms wouldn’t be too exciting. ### In a similar twist, Jonathan Scott is not the only one swinging a hammer, though the show certainly makes it seem that way. In real life, he always has a crew helping, even if they don’t get as much time on camera. ### The arguments are staged ### Ever notice how there’s always a big added expense or unforeseen issue that pops up halfway through the episode? That’s intentional to keep you watching. And while problems are sure to happen during any renovation, it’s the surprise factor that’s usually staged. Drew and Jonathan Scott are most likely well aware of these issues long before the filming starts. ### Also, the producers might do re-shoots and play up any arguments between the homebuyers, no matter how trivial they may seem. After all, it’s the drama that keeps people watching—right along with those satisfying big reveals! ### 2019 Showbiz Cheat Sheet, All Rights Reserved.",60119,1,"Same goes for Property Brothers.

First, he’s tried before and failed. ‘I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms.’ He has already tried to persuade Flynn to (at a minimum) spill info,” he wrote. “Next, he knows Flynn is cooperating. Saying he understands Flynn is getting a deal, and therefore can’t have a joint defense, shows that knowledge. He also knows, because he’s very experienced, that spilling info to Trump’s team would be very , very bad for Flynn.” ### According to White, “So Flynn will have two choices: lie (in a case in which he is charged with lying), or admit he fed information about what he said during cooperation to a subject of the investigation.” ### Summing up some of other phrasing from the transcript, he bluntly stated: “there’s what a jury would almost certainly understand to be an offer of pardon in exchange for his help.” ### You can see the tweets below: ### Take note, for a moment, of the dishonor reflected in this voicemail. ### First, he’s tried before and failed. “I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms.” He has already tried to persuade Flynn to (at a minimum) spill info. ### /1",60119,1,"First, he’s tried before and failed. “ I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms. ” He has already tried to persuade Flynn to (at a minimum) spill info.###/1","[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]","<p>First, he’s tried before and failed. “ I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms. ” He has already tried to persuade Flynn to (at a minimum) spill info.</p><p>/1</p>",758

The Olympics swimmer 50p coin with lines over its face is very hard to come by - but now, an expert in coins has shared some advice on how to get hold of it. ### PUBLISHED: 04:01, Sat, Jun 1, 2019 ### | UPDATED: 10:33, Sat, Jun 1, 2019 ### 0 ### Coin collecting is a hobby which is loved by many, and it can see some people pay huge amounts of money for rare and/or scarce coins. From coin shows to online marketplaces such as eBay , there’s a whole host of places where sellers will head to in order to put it up for purchase. Wherever you find the coin, it’s advisable to do your research first - in order to check its value and to ensure that it's genuine. That’s why Express.co.uk has sought the expertise of a coin collecting expert from Royal Mint. ### Related articles ### Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, Matt Curtis, Historics Manager for Collector Services at The Royal Mint, explained the difference between a scarce coin and a rare coin. ### So, what makes a coin rare? ### He explained: “If there are only a small number of coins known to be available for collectors to buy, this makes it hard for people to find them for sale, which can in turn lead to high prices.” ### Comparing this to a scarce coin, he detailed: “For a coin to be classed as ‘scarce’ it will have a low mintage figure, but shouldn’t be too hard for collectors to find. ### “Scarce coins tend to be worth significantly more than its original value. ### “An example of a rare 50p would be the 2011 Olympic swimming 50p with the swimmer’s face under water known as the “lines over face” version. ### “You would need to be prepared to pay £1,500 for a circulated example!” ### Royal Mint: The Olympics 50p coin with lines over the face is considered rare (Image: GETTY • ROYAL MINT) ### On the other hand, the 2009 Kew Gardens 50p coin is considered scarce. ### Pointing out its difference to being rare, Matt said: “The Kew Gardens 50p is considered scarce as opposed to rare, as they are easy enough to buy on the secondary market and you could buy one for around £100; still a significant amount more than its original value!” ### Matt also pinned down the key difference between scarcity and rarity, explaining: “It’s all to do with the number of coins available for collectors to buy, either because of an initial low mintage figure or, for more historical coins, the number left in existence.” ### If you’re looking for the rarest circulating 50p coin out there, Matt suggested that it is likely to be the 2011 Olympics swimmer coin, which has lines over the face. ### So, where should a person head if they want to get hold of this genuine coin? ### “The best place to find it are from coin dealers and at coin shows,"" Matt told Express.co.uk. ### Related articles ### eBay: ‘Rare’ Victoria Cross 50p selling for £1,300 - but why? ### Royal Mint: Heading to a coin show may give you the best chance of finding the Aquatics 50p coin (Image: ROYAL MINT) ### Some people will head online in order to pick up coins for their collection. What advice would Matt give on the matter? ### “If they are selling a genuine coin they will be happy to help with extra info and details about the coin,” he said. ### “Fake coins are often not the right weight or diameter, so asking the seller for these measurements is definitely worthwhile before you purchase."" ### Another of Matt’s coin collecting tips is to “always buy the best quality coins you can”. ### He added: “A coin’s value comes from its rarity and condition – you can’t control rarity but you can control condition!”",60119,1,"Coin collecting is a hobby which is loved by many, and it can see some people pay huge amounts of money for rare and/or scarce coins.

1026,"Burger King Brexit ### Saturday, June 1, 2019 16:48 ### % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents. ### I wonder if this is how the common people in Britain have started to view this nonsense dealing with the pressure of global government officials regarding BREXIT. ### “A popular Costa Del Sol restaurant has recently added the “Brexit Burger” to it’s extensive menu.   The Happy Egg, on a run down backstreet in Torremolinos, [southern Spain] created the new burger to reflect the tastes of British tourists.  The chef who came up with the burger is today defending it, claiming it is exactly what the name suggests. ### Customers who order the Brexit Burger are presented with the traditional polystyrene burger box.  However, some have expressed outrage when opening the box to find that it’s completely empty.” ### This is sadly funny: Comedian Alistair Williams explains Brexit via Burger King LIVE from Top Secret Comedy Club ### [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGL-XJPuCuo&w=640&h=360] ### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edGFTEbZCHQ ### Maybe in this version, the management should also have thrown a milkshake at them for wanting to leave, as happened to Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and other supporters: ### (Maybe Burger King has gone too far somewhat endorsing the milkshake tossing.) ### Nigel Farage Is the Most Dangerous Man in Britain ### “LONDON — Nigel Farage is the British crisis in human form. His party, the unambiguously named Brexit Party, which is hardly a party and didn’t exist six months ago, won nearly a third of the British vote in the recent European Parliament elections, putting it in first place and driving the shattered Conservative Party into fifth. Long underestimated, Mr. Farage has done more than any politician in a generation to yank British politics to the hard, nationalist right. He is one of the most effective and dangerous demagogues Britain has ever seen.” ### Apparently the NYT (big surprise) is liberal and in favor of globalism – not “Euroskeptic” of Brussels having too much power.  Of all the major nations of Western Europe – Britain has the best chances of surviving the aftermath of the European Union’s immigration policies – because much like the sea protected the island from invasion in WWII – Nostradamus suggests the invasions during WWIII will stop in France – which will pay the heaviest price for policies of national suicide… ### Nostradamus had one quatrain in particular (10:66) which may be warning us that such events are getting close: ### The chief of London through the realm of America, ### The Isle of Scotland will be tried by frost: ### King and Reb will face an Antichrist so false, ### That he will place them in the conflict all together. ### Boris Johnson was the Chief (Mayor) of London, and he was born in America and still has dual citizenship, and it looks like he will be the next Prime Minister of Great Britain.  It seems Nostradamus is suggesting that Boris Johnson will be the British Prime Minister during WWIII, and that Britain and America will end up on the same side . ### Support BeforeitsNews by trying our natural health products!

38464,"I'm An Executive Assistant Making $105K ### Day One ### 7 a.m. — My alarm goes off, and I'm already tired of this week. I usually double up my pour over coffee to drink one cup at home and take one for the road, but my boyfriend, E., gets the second cup this morning. I take the streetcar to work and pop into the Starbucks across the street for an unsweetened iced coffee with coconut milk in my own tumbler. $3.14 ### 9 a.m. — I grab a couple hard-boiled eggs and a pack of apple slices from the office fridge for breakfast. I'm so hungry, and coffee on an empty stomach isn't helping, but waiting until I'm at work to eat means free breakfast! ### 12 p.m. — Last week, a friend who works for a travel company asked me pull together some Seattle recommendations. My phone starts buzzing a bunch, and it's the story going live. I did it for free, but it sounds like I can create similar content for other paid projects through the travel company down the line. ### 12:45 p.m. — We have a long meeting today, and I rush out afterwards to grab the food I brought from home: lentils and roasted sweet potatoes with harissa vinaigrette. ### 1 p.m. — I meal prepped over the weekend to pack my lunches this week, but I still like breaking up my day with a walk outside. I decide to go out for a small treat and consider a couple nearby bakeries before ending up at the grocery store Uwajimaya. I get sesame balls (my fave!), seaweed salad, and a bottle of unsweetened green tea. $6.47 ### Advertisement ### 2:15 p.m. — I email and text back and forth with the creative director from my last job. She's launching a new project and wants my help with copywriting. She Venmos me the $800 we agree on to get started on the brand story, and I transfer it to my bank. I love getting paid in advance, and it's great to have a project with someone I already trust and know how to work well with. ### 3:30 p.m. — I get hit with afternoon tiredness and a headache, too. After being social most of the weekend, I'm dying to get home and relax, so I cancel the evening strength training class I'd signed up for a little too optimistically. I've been going to a great studio right by my old office for the past year, but now it's inconvenient to get over there. I cancelled my membership and am riding out my last month before getting back on ClassPass to find workouts that are easier to get to. ### 5:30 p.m. — I get home, and the Sephora order I placed during the 20% off spring sale has arrived. I usually shop in store, but I wanted the new online-only Herbivore Botanicals Emerald Oil with CBD. I went to the launch party for it while I was between jobs and couldn't afford it, so I'm excited to try it now. Plus, I finally got a shade of Fenty concealer that matches my skin tone. Turns out I have no idea what my undertone is, so it took a few tries. Now I can return the wrong shade I bought last week. I'm way more into skincare than makeup, so while I don't wear foundation, I do want to cover up the dark circles under my eyes, and I hope this works well! ### Advertisement ### 6 p.m. — I boil some gnocchi for a quick shot of carbs and heat up soup I made yesterday for a more balanced dinner. It's spring minestrone from Bon Appétit — so good, and so many greens! I watch Knock Down The House on Netflix while I eat. ### 7:30 p.m. — I decide to take a bath and read. I just got Ruth Reichl's new book, Save Me the Plums, from the library, and I'm already charmed. She's one of my favorite writers. I'd love to do some kind of food writing someday, but for now I keep cooking as a hobby, eating as pleasure, and writing as work. ### Daily Total: $9.61 ### Day Two ### 7 a.m. — I wake up with a sore throat and an earache. Maybe I was especially tired yesterday because I'm getting sick. I take my usual daily Zyrtec for allergy season to see if I just have worse allergies today. I make coffee and eat a couple hard-boiled eggs I snagged from the office fridge while waiting for it to kick in. ### 8 a.m. — I decide to work from home to fend off this potential sickness. I have no meetings on my calendar for the day and just have to finish some email copy and do research for an article, so it shouldn't be a problem. I drink a mug of Throat Coat tea and read during the hour I'd usually spend getting ready and commuting into the office. ### 10 a.m. — I get a notification that the earnings from my latest Poshmark sale ($12.80) have posted, and Ebates sent my last month's earnings ($5.52) to my PayPal account. I request transfers for both to my bank account. I sell skincare products I got for free on Poshmark for a tiny bit of extra cash. Why not make a few extra dollars here and there? ### 11 a.m. — I heat up spicy corn and coconut soup I had in the fridge for lunch. It's not a great sick day soup (not brothy enough), but I love anything with garlic, ginger, and shallots. Plus, I made it last week, so it needs to be eaten before it's too late. ### 12 p.m. — I get an email from my bank that they're introducing paper checks! Their whole schtick is being super modern and paper-free, but I've been getting money orders from USPS for my rent every month and it's such a hassle. I order a book of checks. $5 ### 12:45 — I decide to walk to the library for fresh air and to move a bit. I throw on leggings and SPF and then listen to an interview with Phoebe Robinson on The Sporkful podcast on the way there. I have What My Mother and I Don't Talk About on hold and grab Trust Exercise by Susan Choi, too. I stop at QFC (Quality Food Center supermarket) on the way back for dish soap and a shower sponge, plus I get a couple boxes of fruit popsicles and two packs of frozen paratha. I eat a peach popsicle as soon as I get home. $18.11 ### 4:30 p.m. — I make vegetarian cauliflower and mushroom bolognese sauce and then boil chickpea and lentil penne to eat with it. I'm definitely not gluten-averse, but I like this pasta because it has tons of protein and fiber. I listen to the latest episode of the Glowing Up podcast while I cook, and their interview with Billie Lee has a lot of Botox and filler talk. I'm curious about injectables because I hear about them all the time working in the beauty industry, but I'm nervous to drop that much cash and then have to keep doing it. I consider calling the doctor's office I've already researched to schedule a consultation for Botox, but I don't. ### 5:30 p.m. — I buy the latest episode of Killing Eve on Amazon Prime. I don't have cable, and have already done free trials on the other streaming sites that get new episodes every week (all these streaming services give me a headache!), but I love watching Jodie Comer as Villanelle so much that I can't wait until the whole season shows up on Hulu. It's worth it for her outfits alone. $3.29 ### 8 p.m. — I finish the Ruth Reichl book and start Greek to Me by Mary Norris, the copy chief of The New Yorker. It never occurred to me that the word ""alphabet"" comes from alpha and beta! I'm fascinated by the etymology of words — sometimes it's like ""duh!"" but it's cool to make connections. I also prepare a pitcher of cold brew before I go to bed so I have coffee ready in the morning. ### Daily Total: $26.40 ### Day Three ### 6:30 a.m. — Up a little bit earlier today because I need to shower and am thinking about walking into work. The weather's nice, and it honestly takes the same amount of time because the streetcar's so slow. I just don't like doing it if I'm short on time, because then I get sweaty trying to book it into the office and hate starting the day frazzled. I eat a few bites of lentils and sweet potatoes straight from the container to get going. ### 7:30 a.m. — I spent the last couple months working on a big skincare branding project through an agency, and I'm trying to figure out the status on that since I haven't heard from the project managers in a couple weeks. I emailed last week asking if I could go ahead and invoice them if my part is considered done. But, of course, the moment I ask about getting paid, they go silent. I considered freelancing full-time before I started my current job last month, but I'm so not down with chasing payments like this. I send a follow-up message with a couple more people cc'd so there's more visibility. Fingers crossed... ### 8:30 a.m. — Ugh, I'm coughing and still not feeling great even after coffee, allergy meds, and getting completely ready. I message my team that I'm working from home again. The last cold I had a few months ago turned into walking pneumonia, and I was sick for weeks, so I'm not taking any chances when I can take it easy and still get work done at home. ### 11 a.m. — Back to chickpea and lentil pasta with the veggie bolognese sauce for lunch. I've also been pounding the cold brew because the whole pitcher is just there in the fridge. I usually only have two to three cups of coffee a day, but I'm already on four. ### 2 p.m. — I eat a strawberry popsicle and drink a mug of tea before calling in for a team meeting. I'm grateful to not have as hectic of a workload as some of my coworkers, but I also learn that the strategy behind what I'm working on is about to change, so I'll soon have to go back and make a ton of edits across everything. Not going to worry about that until it's happening, though. I've been stressed lately just about life being too busy with all the usual things (day job, freelance projects, socializing, relationship, appointments, working out, chores) because I have low energy and need a lot of alone time to recharge. Everyone's hyped on being a #girlboss, but I thought we already learned it's exhausting trying to ""have it all."" I feel more empowered by a nap. So for now I'm not going to invite in any additional worry and just get work done as it needs to be done. ### 4 p.m. — I mix roasted peanuts with banana chips for an afternoon snack. More coffee, too. Whoops. I've started diluting it with almond milk, though. I do some exercises with my dumbbells and kettlebell throughout the day whenever I move around the apartment or stand up from the computer to think for a sec. ### 5:45 p.m. — I regularly go to trivia with my main group of friends from college on Wednesdays. It's at a bar close to my apartment, and the gift card prizes we often win keep us coming back. There's a patio, so I walk over early to make happy hour and sit outside to read (and eavesdrop on awkward Tinder dates). I get sweet potato tacos and a Rainier beer. I have a theory that you can track how much Seattle has changed over the past several years through the rising price of Rainier and what tall boys cost at different bars. This $2 happy hour one is practically unheard of now, but it used to be the norm! I avoid bars that charge more than $4 — especially if it turns out to be a short can. ### 10:30 p.m. — We get second place at trivia after thinking we were doing horribly all night, so we win a $10 gift card to spend next week. We've saved up a couple gift cards, so we should be able to cover at least one drink for everyone next week. After a few more Rainiers and a tipsy order of bread and butter, my tab's at $24.33, and I tip $5. $29.33 ### 12:30 a.m. — E. ended up in the area for a work outing and was going to come spend the night, but within the 15 minutes of us agreeing to that plan and him showing up at my apartment, I pass out and sleep through him trying to buzz in! I'm the worst! I wake up an hour later to pee, realize what happened, and call to apologize. Thankfully he just thinks it's funny, and we know we'll see each other tomorrow. Ugh. ### Daily Total: $29.33 ### Day Four ### 7 a.m. — I wake up with a bit of a headache but have to get it together to actually go into work today. I drink the last bit of cold brew with almond milk and fry two eggs for breakfast. ### 8:30 a.m. — Before hopping on the streetcar, I pop into Starbucks for an unsweetened iced coffee with coconut milk, knowing I'll need the extra caffeine today. $3.14 ### 11:30 a.m. — Work is flying by, but I pause to find lunch. I brought soup, but I'm way hungrier than that. I walk over to the International District and get panang curry with tofu from Thai Curry Simple ($11.85 after tip). I also stop at Bartell's drugstore for a two-pack of eye drops and flaxseed oil ($37.41) because my eyes have been so dry and itchy lately I can barely wear contacts. I try to use my FSA card, but it doesn't work. I'll see if I can get reimbursed later. $49.26 ### 2 p.m. — I eat a grapefruit cup from the office and pour the extra juice into a grapefruit La Croix. Game-changer. ### 4:15 p.m. — I get an email from an editor at the magazine I've been freelance copyediting for about doing some proofing for the new issue. It's time-consuming to go through a whole magazine, and I'm not sure when I'll fit it in, but I say yes. I also got an email this afternoon following up on an article I pitched for a skincare brand's blog. I'll have to work on that soon. It can be challenging to make time for more work outside my day job when my salary there meets my needs, and extra projects become more about trading in personal time, but I think of it as making connections and fostering opportunities for future me. ### 5 p.m. — I'm meeting E. downtown for a 7 p.m. movie, so I leave work and take the light rail that way. There's no use going home between now and then. I go to Sephora and exchange the mismatched concealer for Kate Somerville SPF setting spray. I wanted the one from Supergoop!, but it wasn't in store and I asked a sales associate for a recommendation. It's $13.21 for the difference. Then, I go kill time reading at Anchorhead Coffee with an IPA for $5.50 + $1 tip. $19.71 ### 6:30 p.m. — E. got us free advanced screening tickets for Booksmart. I'm excited to see more of Beanie Feldstein after Lady Bird, and we've been finding the new What We Do in the Shadows show with her hilarious. I get us a Diet Coke to share — a bad habit reserved for the movies. $7.02 ### 9 p.m. — The movie is so good! We go to Din Tai Fung for dinner afterwards. We share bok choy, vegetarian rice cakes, and vegetarian dumplings. My treat, because I feel bad for bailing on E. last night. It's $37.98 and I tip $8. $45.98 ### 10:30 p.m. — We walk to my apartment and then watch an episode of Tuca & Bertie before bed. It's pretty heavy after the lighter earlier episodes and leaves me a little uneasy. This show and Bojack Horseman so perfectly balance cheeky humor and trauma. ### Daily Total: $125.11 ### Day Five ### 6:40 a.m. — I wake up and run across the street to spin class. The studio's an expensive SoulCycle knock-off, but they emailed earlier in the week offering a free class credit. This is exactly what I mean by needing a studio closer to home. Working out makes such a huge difference in my mood and energy, and I need to get back into it! ### 9:30 a.m. — I take my time showering and getting ready while E. does some work before we both head out. I take the streetcar and pick up my becoming-the-usual iced coffee from Starbucks ($3.14). I prefer other coffee shops, but there's a Starbucks at both of the streetcar stops I use, and it's cheaper than $5 cold brew somewhere else. Once I'm in the office, I grab a couple hard-boiled eggs and a pack of apple slices. I see that Girlfriend Collective is doing a $20 off deal this weekend, and, high on my spin class vibes, I decide to order a bra and leggings set ($94.69). Maybe it'll motivate me to go more. $97.83 ### 11:30 a.m. — Snack time at the office. I chill on a different floor of the office by a window. ### 1 p.m. — I meet up with a couple friends who work nearby for lunch at Il Corvo. I order paccheri with mustard greens and lemon butter, as well as kale salad, focaccia, and a wine pitcher to share with one friend. I pay the full tab ($49 + $10 tip), including his pasta dish, and then he Venmos me for half. Everything is delicious, and I'm glad the afternoon at work will fly by after a nice long lunch. (Wine helps.) $29.50 ### 4:30 p.m. — I head out of work a little early and take the streetcar to Whole Foods on my way home for a six-pack of beer and sparkling water ($16.49). I'm feeling adventurous, so it's a guava blonde ale and ginger sparkling water. I lounge at home with a beer and a quick nap to try to work up energy to meet a bunch of friends at a dock on Lake Washington, but it seems like a lot and I already had social time today with lunch. $16.49 ### 9 p.m. — I'm exhausted, and E. ends up working past 8, so we have separate nights in, both rewatching the beginning of Game of Thrones. I never watched the show until this season, but my friends host people every Sunday for it and I enjoy yelling at the TV and speculating too. I'm surprised to see how much of what happened in the first couple episodes is connected to what's going on now at the end. ### Daily Total: $143.82 ### Day Six ### 7:30 a.m. — I wake up and go straight to QFC. My neighborhood gets really busy on the weekends because there's a ton of restaurants and bars. It can be annoying to navigate through brunch groups blocking the sidewalk while just trying to run errands. I buy toilet paper, olive oil, and coffee beans — the basic essentials. $22.08 ### 11:30 a.m. — I have a meeting for the project I'm working on with my old creative director. She picks me up and we go to Mighty-O for coffee and donuts before meeting another old coworker around the corner at No Bones Beach Club, a vegan tiki bar that's one of my faves. I have a buffalo tempeh salad and a drink with tequila, mezcal, turmeric, and pineapple. The project we discuss is super exciting and I'm happy to be on board and working with these ladies again. The creative director covers the food and drinks as a business expense for her. ### 2:30 p.m. — I texted some friends about going to the beach at Golden Gardens earlier because I knew I'd be on that side of town. Two biked over, so I'm meeting them there. I go to Ballard Beer Company to pick up a six-pack of Reuben's beer to share ($12) and then call a Lyft ($12.56) to the beach. It's packed because this is the first hot weekend of the summer. We hang out for a couple hours and then decide to meet another friend at a brewery in Ballard. $24.56 ### 4:30 p.m. — We try to go to Reuben's, but it's really busy, and instead end up at Stoup. I first get a hefeweizen and then a sour. My friend buys me one since I brought the beach beer ($6). We're sun-drunk and drunk-drunk enough to be unable to resist the food truck at the brewery. It's latke sandwiches, and I get the vegetarian one with brie and apple slices ($11.50). $17.50 ### 7:30 p.m. — I catch a ride in my friend's Uber and then walk home from her place. I pass by one of my favorite Thai restaurants on the way and pick up pad thai and another tofu and veggie dish to share with E. when I get home and he comes over. Definite case of the drunchies. ### 9:30 p.m. — We watch The Wandering Earth on Netflix, but I get really sleepy two-thirds of the way in and go to bed while he finishes it. ### Daily Total: $94.01 ### Day Seven ### 9 a.m. — It's a lazy Sunday, and we lounge around with a whole lot of coffee. I eat the last bits of pad thai for breakfast. ### 12 p.m. — I boil chickpea and lentil pasta, and heat up the veggie bolognese sauce for both of us for lunch. Then I lay down and nap for an hour. ### 2:30 p.m. — We take the bus and go to La Marzocco to kill some time and perk up with coffee. I order an iced Americano for me and a nitro cold brew for E. I pay for both and tip $2. $11.50 ### 3:15 p.m. — We walk over to SIFF Uptown for an afternoon showing of Her Smell. The ticket is $9, and E. gets us a popcorn and a Diet Coke to share. $9 ### 6 p.m. — We get out of the movie feeling all on edge because it was so intense. Incredibly well-done and well-acted, but it got under my skin. Our Game of Thrones viewing party isn't until later, so we hop on the bus to go find some food and somewhere to chill for a bit. ### 6:30 p.m. — We decide on Nacho Borracho. I order two nopales and mushroom tacos from the food window in the back ($9.91 after tip). E. orders me a margarita from the bar. Then we go to QFC for La Croix and a bottle of Grüner Veltliner to share at GoT night ($13.74). $23.65 ### 7:30 p.m. — It's a full house for the Game of Thrones viewing tonight, plus the episode is intense so there's a lot of joking, groaning, gasping, and shushing. It's the second to last episode, and finally there's some action that lives up to my expectations from hearing everyone else talk about this show for years. ### 10 p.m. — E. and I walk back to my apartment and watch the last two episodes of Tuca & Bertie before falling asleep. ### Daily Total: $44.15  Refinery29 in no way encourages illegal activity or harmful behavior.

28129,"Draymond Green Opens Up About Ugly Kevin Durant Fight That Threatened To Sink Warriors ### Ezra Shaw / Getty Images ### Tyler MacDonald ### Back in November, the Golden State Warriors’ Draymond Green and Kevin Durant got into an on-court spat that threatened to sink the team’s season. Durant blamed Green for not getting him the ball to take the game, and Green didn’t take it kindly — he cursed out Durant, called him out for potentially leaving as a free agent in the summer, and told him that the Warriors didn’t need him. ### Although many fans wanted Green to apologize to Durant — and move forward as soon as possible — Green didn’t feel that was right. Business Insider reports that in a recent ESPN interview, one provided via YouTube , the Warriors’ power forward revealed why he decided to hold off on apologizing right away. ### “Because, A. It’s not the time for that… That’s ridiculous. First off, you need to let time do its job. And when the time is right, I’ll feel that and it’ll be genuine. But what I wasn’t going to do is I wasn’t going to go to Kevin and say I’m sorry because everybody wanted me to. No, it’s going to genuinely happen and when it genuinely happened, everything will correct itself. But if we force it, it won’t correct itself.” ### UPROXX reports that when the two finally talked, Draymond apologized, and admitted that his emotions get the best of him in some situations. But Durant allegedly said that everyone gives Draymond a pass for being emotional, and reportedly told Draymond that he isn’t going to do the same. Durant seemingly told Draymond that he’s “not allowing” him to use it as an excuse anymore. ### Draymond Green sits down for a VERY honest conversation on what he had to give up in order to get what he wanted, what he learned from that fight he had with Kevin Durant earlier in the season, what he thinks KD will do in free agency & just how confident he is against Toronto. pic.twitter.com/D6mgEUPvPl ### — Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) May 30, 2019 ### Draymond said that Durant’s response played a “big” role in his personal growth, and remarked that he was forced to look at the situation from a different perspective because he valued Durant’s opinion. Draymond also admitted that Durant’s potential departure wasn’t necessarily the thing that caused him to explode — it was that he felt Durant wasn’t committing to being a Warrior. ### “It was are you with us or not that bothered me.” ### Since the Warriors rarely have to deal with players potentially departing in free agency, Green likely doesn’t have experience in handling such a situation. And given the NBA rumors that are constantly swirling, it’s understandable that his paranoia got the better of him. ### Loading... ### — SLAM (@SLAMonline) May 30, 2019 ### The Warriors recently lost Game 1 of the NBA finals against the Toronto Raptors, by a score of 109-118. Durant is currently benched for a strained calf, and although reports of his return are conflicting, Sports Illustrated claims that he is definitely still out for Sunday’s Game 2. ### Loading... ### LATEST HEADLINES",60119,1,"Draymond Green Opens Up About Ugly Kevin Durant Fight That Threatened To Sink Warriors###Ezra Shaw / Getty Images###Tyler MacDonald###Back in November, the Golden State Warriors’ Draymond Green and Kevin Durant got into an on-court spat that threatened to sink the team’s season.

You get to discover new products or snacks or recipes in a sort of surprise fashion.

Which makes sense when you consider how many beauty and lifestyle subscription boxes there are. The industry as a whole has been propelled by women. ### After hours of reading reviews and watching unboxing videos (which I’m now obsessed with, BTW), we’ve rounded up some of the best subscription services for women. ### SEE ALSO: 13 of the best subscription boxes for men ### When deciding on a service to subscribe to, there are some things for you to consider. Obviously, you’ll want to make sure it’s something you’re actually interested in, whether that’s beauty, clothing, fitness, books, or whatever else you’re into. Price and number/quality of products are huge factors as well. With a subscription service, you want to make sure you’re at the very least getting something worth the amount you pay; often you want to opt for a subscription that delivers a value more than what you pay. Also take into account if the products are sample- or full-size. ### Because of the nature of subscription services, you don’t necessarily know what you’re receiving or have much authority in the matter. For this reason, services often deliver an overall product worth much more than what you’re dropping on it. They often promise a retail value considerably higher than what they charge. ### SEE ALSO: 10 of the best snack subscription boxes ### To go along with pricing, shipping is something to keep in mind. Are you going to have to pay extra or is it included? You’ll also want to look into the different payment plans that companies offer. You can typically save some money if you prepay for multiple deliveries at once. ### Aside from that, take into account how often you’ll receive an order. Subscriptions can come as frequently as multiple times a week to as infrequently as once every three months, though most deliver once a month. ### Now that you’re equipped with the necessary background knowledge, check out 17 of the best subscription boxes for women with all kinds of needs and tastes.",60119,1,"In most cases, you don’t have direct say over what you receive in a subscription box, which is part of the fun.

Top-rated NHL draft prospect Hughes is scheduled to meet with the media on Friday, May 31, 2019, while attending the league's pre-draft scouting combine in Buffalo. ### Petr David Josek ### BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — John Wroblewski wasn't entirely sure what he was getting into in 1997 as a member of the inaugural group of players selected to participate in USA Hockey's National Team Development Program. ### Nor could he have envisioned during those humble beginnings how much the program would eventually evolve. ### Some 22 years later, Wroblewski coached the Under-18 team and played a key role in helping produce a bumper-crop class of elite prospects eligible to be selected in the NHL draft at Vancouver, British Columbia, in three weeks. ### ""Every day, you drive in and coast past the flag on the way to your parking spot ... and you kind of pinch yourself at what's been fostered,"" Wroblewski said by phone Saturday, referring to the program's headquarters in Plymouth, Michigan. ""It's unfathomable what's occurred."" ### Led by center Jack Hughes , who has a chance of becoming the eighth American-born player selected first overall and first since Toronto drafted Auston Matthews No. 1 in 2016, the NTDP has the potential of having a program-record six players taken in the first round. ### Though alums include Matthews, Chicago's Patrick Kane and Buffalo's Jack Eichel, the program has never had more than three players selected in the first round immediately after completing their two-year terms. ### Reflecting on the team assembled from a five-day tryout camp in March 2017, the 38-year-old Wroblewski knew there was something special about this group. ### ""We had the team picked on Saturday night, when the camp was going to break on Tuesday morning,"" he recalled. ""When that separation point was quite apparent at the time, we knew what we had."" ### Hughes is NHL Central Scouting's top-ranked North American prospect after setting a two-year NTDP record with 228 points (74 goals, 154 assists). Centers Alex Turcotte and Trevor Zegras are ranked fourth and sixth. ### Though under-sized at 5-foot-7 and 162 pounds, winger Cole Caufield is ranked eight after scoring a NDTP record 72 goals this season. And the list of potential first-round selections are rounded out by left winger Matthew Boldy and defenseman Cameron York. ### That's not all. A total of 10 NTDP players are ranked among Central Scouting's top 50 North American prospects, and that doesn't include Spencer Knight, the bureau's top-ranked North American goalie. ### ""It's an exceptional year for the program and these kids have worked hard to gain the recognition that they're getting,"" Central Scouting director Dan Marr said during the NHL's annual pre-draft combine, which closed in Buffalo on Saturday. ""I anticipate USA Hockey will have the biggest smile on their faces on draft day because of the number of players to go in the first round, the top-three rounds and through the entire draft."" ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### The program was established to develop America's top 17-year-olds under one roof and spend two years playing a barn-storming schedule against U.S. Hockey League and college teams. The players also represent the U.S. at Under-17 and 18 international tournaments. ### The 18-year-olds finished this season with a record of 48-16 and won the bronze medal at the world championships, while outscoring their opponents by a combined 369-188. ### Turcotte credited the level of competition simply during practice in spurring players' development. ### ""We all became better hockey players because of how competitive we are and how everyone wants to be the best,"" Turcotte said. ""No one wants to look bad."" ### Arizona Coyotes general manager John Chayka credited the NTDP for staying ahead of the curve in developing players best suited to match the fast-paced style the NHL game is currently trending. ### ""The game's getting to speed and skill, and these guys have it in spades,"" Chayka said, adding he doesn't consider the depth of this year's class of NTDP prospects to be a fluke. ""They did a very good job obviously with this group. And I think it's going to continue."" ### USA Hockey executive director Pat Kelleher hopes the trend continues with Americans now making up about 30% of NHL rosters. ### ""Our goal is to make this more of the norm,"" he said. ""We're getting not only depth of players, but high-end players, elite-level players who are the faces of their franchise as well as USA Hockey. And that's where we want to be."" ### Hughes credited the NTDP for transforming him from what he said was a skinny 16-year-old into ""more of a man."" He also predicted the NTDP producing even more high-end players in the future. ### ""I don't think this is a blip. I think USA Hockey's at the best it's ever been right now,"" Hughes said. ""You see all the young guys in the NHL, the Americans that are at the top of the league right now. I think there's a lot more from where that came from."" ### ———",60119,1,""" We had the team picked on Saturday night, when the camp was going to break on Tuesday morning,"" he recalled.

Opened in 1923, the Coliseum first gained the Rams as a tenant in 1946 when they moved west from Cleveland. (AP Photo/Ryan Kang, File) ### View All (5) ### Perhaps no part of the NFL has evolved more drastically over 100 seasons than the actual places where the games have been played. From the baseball parks some of the league's pioneering teams were shoehorned into during the early days to the billion-dollar palaces been built lately with enough high-definition screens that all 70,000 fans can see the slow-motion instant replays at every angle. ### Here's a look at some of NFL's most iconic and impactful venues over the years: ### LOS ANGELES MEMORIAL COLISEUM, Los Angeles ### Opened in 1923, the Coliseum first gained the Rams as a tenant in 1946 when they moved west from Cleveland. The Raiders played there from 1982-1994 in their L.A. stint between stays in Oakland. Then the Rams came back in 2016 from St. Louis for a final reunion until they move into their new stadium in Inglewood in 2020. The Coliseum will host a third Summer Olympics in 2028. ### SOLDIER FIELD, Chicago ### Opened in 1924 next to Lake Michigan, Soldier Field became host of the Bears in 1971, after they played 50 years in front of the brick and ivy at Wrigley Field. The colonnades remained after the renovated stadium re-opened in 2003 following a one-year stay for the team at the University of Illinois in Champaign. ### LAMBEAU FIELD, Green Bay ### The Packers moved into the new City Stadium, a bigger version across town that was considered the NFL's first football-specific facility, in 1957. Eight years later, it was renamed for the famed franchise's first head coach, Curly Lambeau. The Packers won their first Super Bowl after the 1967 season after beating Dallas in the NFL championship game, known as the ""Ice Bowl,"" on a last-second quarterback sneak by Bart Starr after a kickoff temperature of 13 degrees below zero. ### CANDLESTICK PARK, San Francisco ### Opened in 1961, this stadium near the brisk San Francisco Bay gained the 49ers as a tenant in 1971. The facility, which was much windier for baseball games than it was for football, hosted five Super Bowl championship teams, ranging from the 1981 to 1994 seasons, as future Pro Football Hall of Fame members Joe Montana and Jerry Rice formed one of the league's greatest passing games. Montana's throw to a stretched-out Dwight Clark in the back of the end zone in the NFC title game against Dallas, known as ""The Catch,"" sent the 49ers to their first Super Bowl and helped put the 'Stick on the NFL map. ### THREE RIVERS STADIUM, Pittsburgh ### One of the many cookie-cutter, circle-shaped, multi-purpose facilities of the era, Three Rivers Stadium opened in 1970 for the Steelers, who won four Super Bowl championships during their residency along the riverbanks. One of the most famous plays in NFL history took place here in 1972, when the "" Immaculate Reception "" by Franco Harris off a deflected pass in the closing seconds gave the Steelers a playoff game victory over Oakland. That was the franchise's first postseason win after going the first 40 years without one, the first 37 of which were at Forbes Field and Pitt Stadium. ### TEXAS STADIUM, Dallas ### Opened in 1971 in the suburb of Irving, the stadium featured a European soccer-style partial roof with a rectangle cut-out that cast long shadows on the turf and kept the game outdoors while still sheltering fans from the weather. Or, as Cowboys linebacker D.D. Lewis was widely purported to have explained the reason for the hole was ""so God can watch his favorite team."" The Cowboys won five Super Bowl championships during their stay at Texas Stadium. ### MERCEDES-BENZ SUPERDOME, New Orleans ### The Superdome has outlasted seven other domed stadiums from the AstroTurf era that have come and gone, even surviving Hurricane Katrina that forced the Saints to play elsewhere in 2005. The spaceship-like building, which opened in 1975, has hosted seven Super Bowls. At the last one, six years ago, Baltimore beat San Francisco after a 34-minute power outage darkened the stadium and halted the game. ### CENTURY LINK FIELD, Seattle ### Opened in 2002 for the Seahawks, this stadium quickly became the loudest outdoor facility in the league behind an ardent fan base known as the ""12th Man"" and a unique rainbow truss design that traps in the crowd noise. ### AT&T STADIUM, Dallas ### The first stadium with construction costs that passed the $1 billion price tag, AT&T Stadium opened for the Cowboys for the 2009 season in the suburb of Arlington with a massive, center-hung, high-definition videoboard as the premier attraction among many Texas-sized amenities. The Super Bowl was held there in the stadium's second year, infamously remembered for the temporary sections that weren't completed in time for the big game and ultimately left 400 ticket holders without seats in the quintessential first-world problem. ### US BANK STADIUM, Minnesota ### Opened in 2016 for the Vikings and host of the second-highest scoring Super Bowl following the 2017 season, US Bank Stadium became the NFL's first facility with a translucent roof . The world's largest pivoting glass doors add to the outdoor feel for the indoor stadium. ### ___",60119,1,"Opened in 1923, the Coliseum first gained the Rams as a tenant in 1946 when they moved west from Cleveland.

65013,"Kevin Spacey lawyer says accuser deleted 'exculpatory' messages ### The 59-year-old Oscar winner's career fell apart amid a flurry of sexual misconduct allegations in 2017. ### Author: ALANNA DURKIN RICHER ,  Associated Press ### Published: 6:27 PM CDT May 31, 2019 ### Updated: 6:27 PM CDT May 31, 2019 ### The man who accused Kevin Spacey of groping him at a bar in 2016 deleted text messages that would support Spacey's claims of innocence, the actor's lawyer said in court documents filed Friday. ### Defense attorney Alan Jackson is urging the court to order prosecutors to hand over a ""complete and unaltered"" forensic copy of the accuser's cellphone. He is also accusing prosecutors of trying to conceal that they had been in possession of the man's cellphone since November 2017. ### ""Newly produced evidence confirms"" that the accuser ""deleted exculpatory text messages and provided falsified screenshots of his conversation from the night in question to law enforcement,"" Jackson wrote. ### The accuser ""has gone to great lengths to remove text messages he believes did not fit his narrative. The prosecution is aware of this and hid that information from the defense,"" Jackson wrote. ### An attorney for Spacey's accuser declined to comment. ### Spacey  pleaded not guilty in January to a charge of indecent assault and battery. His lawyers have called the accusation ""patently false."" ### It's the only criminal case that has been brought against the 59-year-old Oscar winner since his career fell apart amid a flurry of sexual misconduct allegations in 2017. ### The case first came to light that year when former Boston TV anchor Heather Unruh said Spacey got her son drunk and sexually assaulted him at Nantucket island's Club Car restaurant and bar, where the teen worked as a busboy. ### Spacey's attorney says it appears the accuser deleted certain messages between him and his then-girlfriend from his phone before sending screenshots of conversations to an officer investigating the case back in November 2017. ### Messages from a screenshot of a group text between the accuser and several of his friends that was sent to the officer have not been turned over to the defense, Jackson says. ### Spacey's lawyer is also challenging the impartiality of the district attorney's office after a top prosecutor in the office disclosed that his sister is friends with Unruh. Jackson is asking for all communications made about the case by First Assistant District Attorney Michael Trudeau, who said his sister shared a ski house with Unruh for years. ### ""The prosecution's bias and apparent advocacy for the complaining witness, rather than the evenhanded pursuit of justice, is perhaps best evidenced by the Commonwealth's decision to withhold"" the accuser's cellphone information, Jackson wrote. ### Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe  told The Boston Globe that he hadn't read the filings and couldn't comment on Jackson's allegations. ### ""If the defendant wasn't who he is, no one would care about this case,"" O'Keefe told the newspaper. ### A spokeswoman for the prosecutors' office said it asked Spacey's lawyers to agree to a protective order because of privacy concerns before turning over data downloaded from the accuser's cellphone, but the defense has not yet done so. ### Another pretrial hearing in Spacey's case is scheduled for Monday. The judge has ordered the Club Car by Monday  to turn over any surveillance footage taken the night the man says Spacey groped him.",60119,1,"The accuser ""has gone to great lengths to remove text messages he believes did not fit his narrative.

22203,"June 1, 2019 ### © Photo: Defense.gov ### In an address to West Point military graduates, US Vice President Mike Pence told them they will one day fight for America. “It’s a virtual certainty,” said Pence who was swelling with pride as he spoke, rather than lamenting. ### Well, at least, he is being candid. The United States is a warmongering nation, there is no doubt about it. As several historical studies attest, out of the 243 years since its formation as a modern state, the US has been at war during every decade, sometimes in multiple simultaneous wars. ### Or put another way, over nearly 95 per cent of its historical existence the US has been involved in waging wars, sometimes covertly or by proxy. Since the Second World War alone, the US has been involved in up to 60 wars or covert conflicts, inflicting a civilian death toll estimated  at 20 million. Arguably, there is not another nation, past or present, with such a record of belligerence. ### So, yes, Pence is correct when he told graduates from the US’ elite military academy: “It is a virtual certainty that you will be on a battlefield for America.” ### Ironically, the vice president, like President Trump and the hawkish national security adviser John Bolton, has never served in the military. Yet Pence held forth like a four-star (armchair) general about the need for young American troops to do battle in a “dangerous world”. ### “I know when that day comes you will move to the sound of guns,” exhorted Pence, whose only experience of gunfire no doubt comes from watching replays of old Hollywood war movies. ### The whole world is a potential battlefield in Pence’s reckoning. (Not just Pence, but nearly all American politicians.) He specifically mentioned US troops going into future conflict with China or North Korea. He also said they may be deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq where US forces have been embroiled for nearly two decades. ### Ominously, Pence warned the new cohort of West Point Second Lieutenants that they may one day be despatched to a war in “this hemisphere”. Given the Trump administration’s backing for a coup in Venezuela and its threats of military intervention, was Pence alluding to a possible war in the works with that South American country, which, by the way, happens to possess the biggest-known oil reserves on the planet? ### The exulting in future wars by Pence comes at a time of escalating military threats from the US towards Iran. The Trump administration has sent an aircraft carrier strike group to the Persian Gulf as well as new missile batteries, nuclear-capable B-52 bombers and more squadrons of F-16 fighter jets. Trump also last week commanded 1,500 more troops to the region to join an already 70,000 stationed there, all in a bid to ostensibly “counter Iranian aggression”. ### The global context of American military deployment, as Pence sanguinely acknowledges, belies the claims made by Washington of it allegedly facing “Iranian aggression”. What’s going on in the Persian Gulf is just one sequence in a whole global series of relentless US militarism. It is estimated that the US has 800 military bases around the planet with its forces deployed in at least 70 countries. The idea that this imperialist configuration is because the US is “the leader of the free world” is a risible propaganda rationale. ### American military power is used to project and protect US capitalist interests. US troops are just hired guns and cannon fodder for corporate profit-making, as former Marine general Smedley Butler scathingly confessed during the 1930s in his classic book ‘War is a Racket’. ### When Pence said: “It is a virtual certainty that you will be on a battlefield for America.” What he really meant to say was… “for American capitalism”. ### US soldiers are sent to wars not to defend American national security or to “promote democracy”, as the myth goes. They are sent to foreign lands to kill, die or be maimed for the sole, sordid purpose of making money for elite bankers, corporate executives or rich shareholders who send their non-serving scions to fancy private colleges like Pence and Trump went to. ### The American ruling class perpetuates itself by sending working-class schmucks into wars-for-capitalist-profit, over and over again. ### The unremitting warmongering that underpins American capitalism is testified by Pence’s address to the West Point graduates. Stripped from the pious rhetoric, Pence was telling like it is: the American way is war, war, and more war. The American way is Total War on the planet to get whatever US corporations need in order to make the oligarchic class even richer. ### Even when the US is purportedly engaged in “diplomacy” it is always ready to exercise the “all options” of militarism in order to get its infernal way. ### Pence referred to US troops one day going to the Korean Peninsula because, he asserted, North Korea is “a threat to peace”. A country where the American military killed three million people during the 1950-53 Korean War. He warned there could be another war against North Korea or China. Partly because China, he said, was “challenging American power”. That’s acceptable cause for war? ### It is quite astounding that the American vice president is envisioning a war with two countries that his administration is supposedly engaging with in ongoing diplomatic negotiations. The Trump administration is trying to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, while also pursuing major economic concessions from China in trade relations. ### Evidently, however, the White House views the ultimate decider to be military force in its relations with these two countries. ### Finian Cunningham ### June 1, 2019 | World ### Brainwashing in Action: Pence Hails Virtue of ‘Certain War’ ### In an address to West Point military graduates, US Vice President Mike Pence told them they will one day fight for America. “It’s a virtual certainty,” said Pence who was swelling with pride as he spoke, rather than lamenting. ### Well, at least, he is being candid.

22936,"Summer 2019: Food safety tips for the grill ###  ### Friday ### May 31, 2019 at 10:16 AM ### Grill season is officially upon us. But handling raw meat comes with its own set of cooking rules — you don't want to be the one giving everyone a side of food poisoning with their burger. ### Whether you're grilling up a few hot dogs or a perfect rib-eye, there are a few safety tips to keep in mind. ### 1. Before you hit the grill ### When shopping for all the necessary items, be sure to keep meats and seafood separate from everything else in the cart and bagged separately to prevent cross-contamination. Keep your meat below 40°F in the refrigerator or an insulated cooler if transporting until it's grilling time. ### 2. Get prepped ### Wash your hands with soap and clean cooking utensils and surfaces before you get to work, including and the grill surface itself. You don't want year-old burger remnants in your steak. ### 3. Keep everything separate ### You can't use the same cutting board for chopping the brisket after using it for slicing raw chicken. Use separate knives, plates and cutting boards for each meat, both before and after cooking. Don't serve food with the same utensils used to handle your raw meat. ### 4. Cook it to the right temperature ### Different meats need to be cooked to different temperatures. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, here are the temperatures to reach when cooking meats: ### 145°F – whole cuts of beef, pork, lamb, and veal (stand-time of 3 minutes at this temperature) ### 145°F – fish ### 160°F – hamburgers and other ground beef ### 165°F – all poultry and pre-cooked meats, like hot dogs ### Keep all cooked food at 140°F until ready to serve to prevent bacteria from growing on your beautifully grilled meal. ### 5. After the grill has cooled ### Make sure to put away any leftovers as soon as possible — food should never be left out more than two hours, or one hour in temperatures above 90°F. Once the food is packed in the fridge, be sure to eat leftovers within four days. ### More from GateHouse Media:",60119,1,"165°F – all poultry and pre-cooked meats, like hot dogs###Keep all cooked food at 140°F until ready to serve to prevent bacteria from growing on your beautifully grilled meal.###5.

Allred, however, did not compete in the T of C that year because of a previous commitment. ### Montoya has qualified for the Senior division of the T of C and was a winner of that event two years ago. Riseling will be trying to win a summer major for the first time ever. ### Alone in fifth place after two rounds is Chris Collins, a newcomer to local summer majors. He is at 7-under 137 following a second round of 3-under 69. ### Four players are tied for sixth at 6-under 138. They include Andrew Brewer, Mitchell Downing, Max Mitchell and Daniel Higgins.

(AP Photo/Jeenah Moon) Credit: The Associated Press ### NEW YORK (AP) — Embracing Manhattan's iconic Rockefeller Center as his venue, Alexander Wang offered a huge hug to his city and American fashion as he showed his latest collection al fresco Friday night — complete with street food and a public crowd joining the usual insiders. ### This ready-to-wear Collection 1 is the start of his second year off the traditional fashion week calendar, choosing June and December over February and September in a plan to offer more options to consumers throughout each year. ### There seemed to be something freeing about that for the designer, who joyously waved to the crowd at the close of his show in pink print cutoffs and a white sweatshirt, bringing family up on his ever-changing lit stage as the sun went down. ### Coming just a few days after Memorial Day, Wang was in an all-American red, white and blue mood, flashing a U.S. flag branded with an ""a'' for, yes, Alexander, as the real thing lined the center's lower plaza on poles. It's where Rockefeller Center's popular skating rink draws masses of tourists. ### Above, Wang branded his food-cart hot dogs, slushies and pretzels for his guests with the same ""a."" His flag made it onto some sweaters and wide elastic undershort waistbands as well. ### ""We're so honored to be here at Rockefeller Center,"" Wang said live on Instagram, YouTube and his website during a pre-show hosted by the young, goofy YouTuber Jay Versace, a fashion show newbie. ""I love New York. It is my home. I feel so proud to be based here. It's such an incredible city."" ### A magnet for supermodels on his runways and celebrity followers, Wang didn't disappoint. Diplo was front row and Kaia Gerber and Kendall Jenner were among his walkers. Versace strolled backstage, chatting up Gerber as he watched the models getting their hair and makeup done. ### Restricting the public to a street-level view of the show, looking down, Wang set up his benches for insiders around the golden masterwork Prometheus, a statue in a fountain done by Paul Manship in 1933. The evening's weather was perfect, closing the city's first sunny, mild day after days of rain. There were smiles all around in the crowd as they were treated to the fresh air. ### On the runway, Wang paid homage to American fashion and some of its greats — Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein among them — as Anna Wintour explained to Versace. She, too, was pleased the city's torrential rains had stopped and not spoiled the experience. ### Wang opened the mixed-gender show with a series of button-down coats and jackets for fall. All had one lapel emblazoned with his name. One model walked in a Statue of Liberty crown and others in tiny black silver studded skirts. Wang topped some heads with billed caps that had head wraps on the outside. ### Denim jackets were paired with asymmetrical skirts, open to the hip on one side and hanging just above the angle on the other. Pete Davison of ""Saturday Night Live"" modeled pants with half black, half white legs, paired with a sleeveless T-shirt on top (showing off his tattoos) and a cap with the bill turned backward. His model strut needs work. ### Fur trimmed a light blue striped shirt-cuffed coat, while chunky soled sneakers were mixed with stilettoes on the feet of his walkers. Fringy western looks came in black with multiple braided belts. There were bright whites in relaxed trousers and jackets, shorts and culottes, some fit for evening versus day streetwear. ### Wispy slip dresses were worn over white T-shirts and loose burnished corduroy pants were cinched at the ankle with elastic. An identical pair of the trousers was done in eggplant purple. ### To close, models stood still in rows, giving the crowd one last long look on Wang's special night. ### Article is invalid or is no longer published. ### Sponsors",60119,1,"Denim jackets were paired with asymmetrical skirts, open to the hip on one side and hanging just above the angle on the other.

(AP) — Word of the arrest — via a friend's text message — hit Wayne Sankey like a thunderbolt. ### ""I said, 'You gotta be kidding me,'"" Sankey recalled. ""And then I told the wife and she couldn't believe it. 'There's no way,' she said. 'Ray down the road?'"" ### Ray Vannieuwenhoven was his next-door neighbor — a helpful, 82-year-old handyman with a gravelly voice and a loud, distinctive laugh, the kind of guy who always waved from his car. ### The widower and father of five grown children had lived quietly for two decades among the 800 residents of Lakewood, a northern Wisconsin town surrounded by forests and small lakes. ### Now authorities were saying this man was a cold-blooded killer. They had used genetic genealogy to crack a cold case that stretched back well into the 20th century — a double murder 25 miles southwest of Lakewood. ### For nearly 43 years, Vannieuwenoven had lived in plain sight, yet outside detectives' radar. ### It was just too much to be believed. Was the guy next door really a monster? ### ——— ### David Schuldes and Ellen Matheys, engaged to be married, set up their campsite at a secluded spot in McClintock Park on Friday afternoon, July 9, 1976. ### It appeared they were alone. ### Schuldes was a 25-year-old part-timer in the circulation department of the Green Bay Press-Gazette; Matheys, 24, worked at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay library. ### They were about to go for a walk, according to court documents and news reports of the time. First, Matheys stopped to use the restroom. ### Two shots from a .30-caliber rifle shattered the quiet. One bullet struck Schuldes' neck from 50 feet away, killing him instantly. The other bullet lodged in a bathroom wall. ### Matheys ran, with the killer in pursuit, investigators say. He caught and raped her, then shot her twice in the chest. ### Her body was found 200 yards from where Schuldes lay, a camera slung over his shoulder. ### Investigators were stumped: The killer took no money and left Matheys' purse in the couple's car. They didn't know why the couple was targeted, and leads were scant. For months, campers avoided McClintock Park. ### DNA profiling in the '90s brought new hope, but detectives got no matches when they submitted the semen from Matheys' shorts to the FBI's national database. ### Last year, detectives contacted Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a DNA technology company whose work with genetic genealogy analysis has helped police identify 55 suspects in cold cases nationwide since May 2018, according to the company. Parabon uploads DNA from crime scenes to GEDmatch, a free, public genealogy database with about 1.2 million profiles, all voluntarily submitted by people who've used consumer genealogy sites like Ancestry.com and 23andMe. ### California law enforcement used GEDmatch to capture the Golden State Killer last year by finding distant relatives and reverse-engineering his family tree. ### Parabon's experts completed Vannieuwenhoven's family tree in late December. They'd found his parents, who had lived in the Green Bay area. Now detectives needed DNA samples from Vannieuwenhoven and his three brothers. Two were ruled out with DNA samples collected from one brother's trash and another's used coffee cup. ### On March 6, two sheriff's deputies knocked on Vannieuwenhoven's door, pretending they wanted him to fill out a brief survey on area-policing. They told him to put the survey in an envelope and seal it with his tongue. ### Detectives didn't need to visit the fourth brother. Eight days later, Vannieuwenhoven was in custody. ### ——— ### At Vannieuwenhoven's first court appearance, on March 22, bond was set at $1 million. ### ""Not guilty, not guilty, not guilty,"" Vannieuwenhoven said, when the judge asked him if he understood the charges. His next court date is June 19. ### Kurt Schuldes, 68, a cousin of David Schuldes in Green Bay, welcomed the news of an arrest, but lamented the time it took: ""He just got away with it for way too long, unfortunately."" ### ""It was a long time coming,"" said Cynthia Chizek, Matheys' 53-year-old niece, who lives in Henderson, Nevada. ""It's just something that always hangs over your head, knowing that there's someone out there who did this heinous crime."" ### Prosecutors and Lakewood residents, meanwhile, were left with the question: Who is Raymand Lawrence Vannieuwenhoven? ### Richard Leurquin, twin brother of Vannieuwenhoven's dead wife, Rita, said his brother-in-law was ""a very loving father to his wife and kids."" He's convinced Vannieuwenhoven is innocent. ### The Vannieuwenhovens were married until her death in 2008, a few months after they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Sankey said after Rita died, Vannieuwenhoven spent his days fishing, hunting, and going on weeks-long camping trips. ### But Vannieuwenhoven had a dark side. To start, this isn't his first time in jail. ### In 1957, when he was 20, married, and going by the name Lawrence Vannieuwenhoven, he was jailed for six months for an unprovoked attack on a 17-year-old girl. She was walking with three friends when Vannieuwenhoven struck her on the back, face, and shoulder. Shortly before, police said, Vannieuwenhoven also tried to attack a 16-year-old girl. ### Vannieuwenhoven said before sentencing he ""was only trying to scare the girls,"" the Press-Gazette reported at the time. ### In 1960, he pleaded guilty to not providing financial support to his wife and their 1-year-old daughter, the Press-Gazette reported then. He was on probation for a year. ### More recently, some neighbors caught glimpses of a menacing side when he drank. He stopped only a few years ago, for his health, they said. ### ""I know this much — when he was drinking he was one son of a bitch. You didn't want to be anywhere near him when he was drinking. Not just me, a lot of people,"" said Fred Mason, 66, who works at the town dump where Vannieuwenhoven was seen frequently, rummaging through scrap piles for small engine parts. ### Robert Ganzell, 86, and his wife sometimes dined out with Vannieuwenhoven. He heard from others that he had a temper when he drank, but Ganzell said he never witnessed it. ### As for the murder charges, Ganzell was nonplussed. ""Never thought of it being him, doing anything like that,"" Ganzell said. Aside from that, he had little to say about Vannieuwenhoven. ### In fact, the neighbors realized that they knew little about this man. For instance, it's unclear where he worked before retiring. Sankey said he's heard Vannieuwenhoven was an iron worker, but he also told Sankey he used to haul and deliver boats. ### Sankey, 68, said he and his wife are still coming to terms with the allegations against their next-door neighbor, the guy who would occasionally repair his lawnmower or snow blower. ### ""People had the impression that he was a very good, normal person, just a retired guy,"" Sankey said. ""No matter where you went you'd mention Ray and they'd say, 'Oh yeah, old Ray.' That was basically about it. It's still hard to believe."" ### ——— ### Associated Press researchers Rhonda Shafner and Jennifer Farrar contributed from New York. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

40350,"The Latest: UK intercepts 74 migrants crossing the Channel ### news now The Associated Press ### LONDON (AP) — The Latest on migrants crossing the Channel into Britain (all times local): ### 8:40 p.m. ### Britain's Border Force has intercepted 74 people, including minors, on eight vessels that were trying to cross the English Channel into Britain. Two other boats were intercepted by French authorities. ### The interceptions came on an exceptionally sunny, warm Saturday for southern Britain. It will heighten concerns that improving weather will encourage smugglers to try their luck at bringing more migrants to the U.K. from France. ### Home Secretary Sajid Javid says the number of migrants attempting to cross the Channel was ""deeply concerning,"" and that he was speaking with his counterparts in France about it. ### Javid says ""those who choose to make this dangerous journey across one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world are putting their lives in grave danger and I will continue to do all I can to stop them."" ### ___ ### 4:30 p.m. ### Britain's Coastguard says it has helped Border Force officers respond to reports of boats carrying migrants off the southeastern coast. ### The number of migrants detained Saturday was not immediately clear.

So by the time he spoke with reporters at a KC Catbackers event just outside the Kansas City limits, he said he wasn't aware of the news of the day: Kansas State wide receiver Isaiah Zuber will transfer to Mississippi State. ### ""Well, I wish him well,"" said Klieman, K-State's first-year head football coach. ""He's a good kid. I like Isaiah. Probably a change of scenery was good for him. I'm happy for him."" ### Zuber entered his name into the NCAA's transfer portal last week. At a Catbacker Tour stop in Wichita on Wednesday, Klieman declined comment on Zuber's potential transfer. ### Not only does Zuber's departure rob the Wildcats of their most proven receiver — he ranked first on the team in catches (52), receiving yards (619), touchdown receptions (five) and yards per game (51.6) in 2018 — but he joins a forthcoming foe: K-State travels to face Mississippi State in Starkville, Mississippi, at 11 a.m. Sept. 14. ### Third-year sophomore receiver Landry Weber, who attended Friday's event, said Zuber leaving is ""tough"" to stomach. But he said the Wildcats' wideouts will trudge forward. ### ""Obviously, we'd love to have him on the team,"" Weber said. ""But at the end of the day, we know that's our brother. We wish him the best. Whatever is best for him, that's what we want."" ### Weber found it amusing that Zuber will be wearing a maroon-and-white uniform when K-State enters Davis Wade Stadium in September. ### ""I thought that was kind of funny,"" Weber said, ""but we'll see what happens. There's no hard feelings, obviously."" ### Zuber transferring was even more difficult for Dalton Schoen to reckon with. A fifth-year senior, Schoen noted that Zuber was his roommate ""every time we traveled"" for a road game the past two seasons. ### ""On a personal level, I love 'Zube,"" Schoen said. ""So I want to see him succeed. I want to see him do well."" ### That being said ... ### ""Week 3, we're going to be squaring off against him,"" Schoen said. ""So it's time to go to battle.

Cassidy, The Associated Press ### Saturday ### Jun 1, 2019 at 10:00 AM Jun 1, 2019 at 10:00 AM ### ATLANTA (AP) "" New York voters for years have experienced some of the longest wait times in the nation on Election Day. Attempts to fix the problem routinely became casualties of the divided politics of the state Legislature. ### That dynamic changed last November, when Democrats won majorities in both legislative chambers, and it didn't take them long to act. ### Just weeks into this year's legislative session, they passed a bill to allow early voting, and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo promptly signed it. ### ""Early voting is going to make a significant difference for countless numbers of New Yorkers by making polling places so much more accessible and allow voters to determine when it is most convenient for them,"" said Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York. ### New York is among a small number of states where Democrats made big gains in last year's election and have used that power to pass laws to make it easier to register and to vote. They have introduced early voting, all-mail voting or automatic registration. ### A few Republican-led states "" some of which saw high turnout for Democratic candidates "" are going in the opposite direction, advancing bills to tighten voter registration and early voting. ### ""Some of this seems like a fairly direct response to things that happened in the midterms,"" said Max Feldman, who tracks voting laws at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law. ### In New Mexico, Democrats not only expanded their majority in the state House but also claimed the governor's mansion after eight years of GOP control. By March, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had signed a law to allow people to register and vote on the same day beginning in 2021. Previously, registration ended 28 days before an election. ### Hawaii lawmakers approved legislation replacing the in-person voting system with one made up entirely of mailed ballots. If the measure is signed into law, the state will join Colorado, Oregon and Washington with mail-only voting. Delaware approved in-person, early voting beginning in 2022. ### While bills increasing voter access this year far outnumbered those seeking to impose restrictions, many of the expansion bills were put forward by Democratic lawmakers in states led by Republicans. That means they are unlikely pass. ### In the 2018 elections, Democrats nearly doubled to 14 the number of states in which they control the governor's office and both legislative chambers, but Republicans remain in charge in more states "" 22. ### While some voting reforms such as automatic registration have drawn bipartisan support, Republicans generally have opposed same-day registration, mail-only voting and other changes, saying they increase the potential for fraud. ### In Connecticut, Republicans recently thwarted a push by Democrats to do as New York did and add in-person, early voting. Democrats have a legislative majority there, but a constitutional amendment is required to make the change, and they fell short of garnering the votes necessary to put the issue on the ballot. ### Republicans had expressed concern that early voters might come to regret their selections if a race's dynamics shifted after they had turned in their ballot. ### GOP lawmakers in some states also have targeted groups that register voters. They say such groups can create a burden for local election officials if they turn in large numbers of forms that are incomplete or contain false information. ### In Tennessee, Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed a law that allows for fines against groups turning in 100 or more incomplete registration forms in a year. ### ""This bill was presented because of actual circumstances that were meant to confuse the integrity, or to create a lack of integrity, in the voting process,"" Lee said. ### Critics say Tennessee's Republicans feel threatened by an increase in voter participation last year. In 2018, turnout in the state was 51 percent higher than in the previous midterm election. About 259,500 new voters registered in the six months before Election Day. ### ""What politicians should be doing is making sure that local election officials have the adequate resources to do their jobs,"" ACLU attorney Sophia Lakin said in announcing a federal lawsuit challenging the new law. ""Silencing civic groups' voices is not the solution."" ### In Texas, where Democrats picked up two congressional seats last year, lawmakers have been considering a bill that would make it a felony rather than a misdemeanor to knowingly put false information on a voter registration form. It would also increase scrutiny of those who provide transportation for voters headed to the polls. ### The legislation passed the state Senate but stalled in the House. ### Voter-suppression claims also have been made against Republicans in Florida, over a constitutional amendment voters approved last year that would make it easier for convicted felons to regain the right to vote. ### Republican lawmakers, in drafting legislation to implement the amendment, said its language about felons having to complete ""all terms of their sentence including parole or probation"" also meant paying all court fees, fines and restitution before being eligible to vote. ### ""This measure is nothing but a poll tax that would effectively disenfranchise those who are unable to pay,"" Rep. Marcia L. Fudge, an Ohio Democrat, said during a recent congressional hearing in Florida. ### The bill's sponsor, GOP state Sen. Jeff Brandes, defended it, saying: ""Our goal was to follow the constitution, and the constitution is clear "" 'all terms of the sentence.'"" ### ___",60119,1,"Jun 1, 2019 at 10:00 AM Jun 1, 2019 at 10:00 AM###ATLANTA (AP) "" New York voters for years have experienced some of the longest wait times in the nation on Election Day.

He has 129 points in 175 career AHL games, all with the Sound Tigers, over the past four seasons. ### He was called up to the Islanders, for whom he has played 42 games the past two seasons, on March 20 for the second time this season.

9459,"e-mail ### By Marty Graham ### SAN DIEGO, May 31 (Reuters) - The military judge presiding over the court-martial of a U.S. Navy SEAL charged with war crimes said on Friday prosecutors who electronically tracked email communications of defense lawyers without a warrant violated the accused's right to a fair trial. ### The finding came near the end of a two-day hearing that wrapped up just 10 days before Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher is due to stand trial in a case that has drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump. ### Gallagher is charged with murdering a helpless, wounded Islamic State fighter in his custody, and with two counts of attempted murder in the wounding of two unarmed civilians, a schoolgirl and elderly man, shot from a sniper's perch. ### The charges stem from Gallagher's deployment as a platoon leader to Iraq's northern city of Mosul, in 2017. ### He has pleaded not guilty to those and other charges, including obstructing justice. If convicted, the decorated career combat veteran could face life in prison. ### Gallagher says he was wrongly accused and that fellow SEAL team members testifying against him, several under grants of immunity, are disgruntled subordinates who fabricated allegations to force him from command. ### His defense team has filed motions seeking either to dismiss the charges altogether, or remove the lead prosecutor from the case, on grounds of alleged misconduct by the prosecutor and agents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). ### The defense specifically has accused Navy lawyers of conducting illegal surveillance of defense attorneys and news media using electronic tracking software secretly embedded in emails sent to the defense. ### In court, prosecutors have said the email ""auditing tools"" they used were designed merely to detect the flow of emails without revealing their content, and were aimed at pinpointing the source of leaks from case files sealed by the judge. ### The judge, Navy Captain Aaron Rugh, adjourned the hearing without ruling yet on the defense motions. But Rugh said he had already found the prosecution's conduct amounted to a violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights to a fair trial under the U.S. constitution. ### Even if the judge refuses to dismiss the case, removing the lead prosecutor, Navy Commander Christopher Czaplak, would probably result in a lengthy delay. ### A ruling on the motions could come any time, and momentum seemed to be moving the favor of the defense. ### At the end of Thursday's proceedings, the judge unexpectedly ordered Gallagher released from base confinement at a nearby military hospital center in San Diego while he awaits trial. ### He was transferred there from a military brig at a Marine Corps air station in California in March at the direction of Trump, who cited Gallagher's ""past service to our country."" ### Trump last Friday said he was considering pardons for a number of service members accused of war crimes, and Gallagher's case is widely believed to be one of the cases under review.

10755,"Massachusetts inches cautiously toward ‘cannabis cafes’ | Modesto Bee ### Massachusetts inches cautiously toward ‘cannabis cafes’ ### By BOB SALSBERG Associated Press ### June 01, 2019 07:58 AM ### ORDER REPRINT → ### FILE -- This Monday, May 20, 2019 file photo shows a marijuana leaf on a plant at a cannabis grow at Loving Kindness Farms in Gardena, Calif. The Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission voted to accept recommendations of a working group that explored the possibility of licensing social marijuana consumption sites, such as pot bars or cannabis cafes, in the Bay State. Richard Vogel, File AP Photo ### BOSTON ### If you're at least 21 in Massachusetts, you can legally buy recreational marijuana at more than a dozen stores that have opened over the past several months. But when it comes to using those products, the law says you can only do so discreetly and privately. ### That could change. ### The state's Cannabis Control Commission voted 3-2 recently to accept the recommendations of a working group that explored the possibility of licensing social-consumption sites for marijuana, a move that potentially would open a new frontier for cannabis businesses and consumers in the Bay State. ### The plan calls for a test rollout of such venues in up to a dozen Massachusetts communities. But don't look for Amsterdam-style cannabis cafes to spring up in the near future. It took more than two years after voters approved a recreational marijuana question for the first retail stores to open, and a full — or even partial — rollout of social-consumption venues could easily take just as long, if it happens at all. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to The Modesto Bee content across all your devices. ### A closer look: ### WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PLAN? ### The recommendations narrowly approved by the commission allow for a test of social-consumption sites in 12 volunteer communities, including five that participated in the working group: Amherst, North Adams, Provincetown, Somerville and Springfield. Up to seven others that want to participate will be chosen. ### State regulators would be authorized to review applications and grant licenses in those communities for establishments such as cannabis cafes, where people could buy and consume marijuana on the premises. The plan also envisions ""event host licenses"" for certain one-time gatherings — an outdoor concert, perhaps. ### The municipalities would have discretion over the types of licenses and how many can be granted. ### Providing opportunities for minority-owned businesses and others that have to date been largely excluded from the legal marijuana industry is listed among the ""primary attributes"" of the pilot program. ### Data collected during the trial period will determine if — and when — social-consumption sites would be allowed elsewhere in Massachusetts. ### ___ ### WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS? ### The working group identified and attempted to address several concerns with social-consumption sites, including the potential for underage pot use, impaired driving and smoking-related health concerns. ### Licensees would be required to have plans in place for assuring that no one under 21 enters an on-site consumption area. Employees of the establishments would be required to complete ""responsible server"" training that includes guidance on cannabis potency and THC absorption times to prevent overserving of patrons. ### Establishments also would need to figure out how to determine when a customer is too impaired to drive and have a plan to assist those customers in finding alternative transportation. This part is tricky because there is currently no approved standard for marijuana impairment, and the effects of some products, notably edibles, take considerably longer to show up than others. ### Under the working group's plan, smoking marijuana would not be allowed at cannabis cafes or other indoor establishments, for health and safety reasons. Indoor vaping would be allowed, if the building has adequate ventilation. ### ___ ### WHEN MIGHT ALL THIS START? ### Likely not anytime soon. ### The commission has invited the public to offer input on the plan, and final regulations would have to be drafted and approved. ### The Legislature must also provide at least tacit approval for the plan. Secretary of State William Galvin has determined the state's current marijuana law doesn't provide a mechanism for voters in a city or town to weigh in on whether on-site consumption should be allowed in their communities. ### Bills to achieve that have been filed in the House and Senate, but no public hearing has been scheduled and it doesn't appear to be among current priorities for lawmakers. ### Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, who would be called upon to sign any such legislation, has been highly skeptical of cannabis cafes but hasn't ruled them out in the future. ### ___ ### WHAT HAVE OTHER MARIJUANA STATES DONE? ### Nearly every U.S. state with legal recreational marijuana has grappled with the question of social use, with differing outcomes. ### The working group said it examined rules in other states, including Alaska's recently approved law that allows pot to be used in designated areas within some stores that sell it. ### San Francisco and some other California communities have moved to allow pot lounges, and the Las Vegas City Council approved a plan earlier this month to authorize venues in the city, though not in casinos. ### Last year, then-Colorado Gov.

Four were engineers who worked to maintain streets and protect wetlands. Three were right-of-way agents who reviewed property lines. The others included an account clerk, a technician, an administrative assistant and a special projects coordinator. In all, they had served the city of Virginia Beach for more than 150 years. ### These 11 city employees and one contractor were wiped out Friday when a fellow city worker opened fire inside a municipal building. A day after the shooting, city officials sought to honor them by sharing their job titles and years of service in a somber slideshow. ### “They leave a void that we will never be able to fill,” said City Manager Dave Hansen, who had worked for years with many of the dead. ### Ducey expressed sympathy for all those affected by the shooting, and he said Arizona is praying for Virginia Beach and thanking responders who acted at the scene. ### Recommended for You ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

And there will be, in New York City and places around the country and world. ### But this year, the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising that fueled the fire for a global LGBTQ movement, there's also a lot more. From symposiums to movie screenings, walking tours to art exhibits, and even an opera, a slew of institutions and organizations are filling June with events that commemorate that moment and its impact through the past five decades, and also using it as inspiration for the current generation of activists to keep pushing for civil rights. ### The uproar at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City's West Village, began on June 28, 1969, when bar patrons and area residents, tired of harassment that was still allowed by law, clashed with police officers who had come to raid the nightspot. Demonstrations continued for the next several nights. ### Those events weren't the first resistance act of the gay rights movement, but it galvanized activism in the United States and around the world. ### That history is all over the events that a wide range of institutions are hosting in June, from an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum called ""Nobody Promised You Tomorrow: Art 50 Years After Stonewall"" to an opera by British composer Iain Bell commissioned by the New York City Opera called ""Stonewall,"" which is getting its world premiere toward the end of the month. ### There are walking tours, like the one from the New York City LGBT Historic Sites Project that will take participants around Greenwich Village and talk about the anti-gay climate that led to the Stonewall protests, and a panel discussion at a branch of the New York Public Library from transgender speakers talking about Stonewall and current trans life. ### ""In the best possible world we would use these anniversaries, and I think it's happening this time, as a jumping-off point to look deeper,"" said Eric Marcus, founder of the Stonewall 50 Consortium, an organization that brought together cultural institutions and others primarily in New York City that have created programming connected to Stonewall. ### It's not just New York City, as Pride festivals and parades are taking place around the country in June and beyond, and references to the Stonewall anniversary are everywhere. ### In Raleigh, North Carolina, a month of events will include a ball celebrating those who resisted at Stonewall. At the Library of Congress in Washington, a display that went up at the end of May called ""Stonewall at 50 - LGBTQ+ Activism in the United States"" uses flyers and other historical items to showcase protest history. ### But for New York City, the anniversary has become the opportunity to take its already high-profile Pride celebrations even higher; Heritage of Pride, the organization that plans the city's parade and other events, has included a commemorative rally in its slate of events for the month, and is hosting WorldPride as well, the first time the international event has been held in the United States in its two-decade existence. ### The confluence of all that has Pride organizers and city tourism officials hopeful that the throngs of visitors who come to take part in the various Pride activities over a period of about six weeks could double. ### Fred Dixon, president and CEO of NYC & Company, the city's marketing organization, said the city's cultural institutions really responded to the anniversary. ### ""We're proud of how many came forward and put together great programming,"" he said. ### The spirit of protest that Stonewall represents is also represented in some events this month, including the Queer Liberation March being planned by the Reclaim Pride Coalition. ### That group decries what it sees as the commercialization and corporatization of mainstream Pride events. The coalition's march is planned for the same day as the main Heritage of Pride march June 30. ### ""There are members of our community who have always struggled, who have always been left behind,"" said Natalie James, co-founder of Reclaim Pride. ""What I think we want to go back to is ... the radicalism and solidarity of the early days of the activists in this movement.""",60119,1,"Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

4456,"Chennai: English is language of elite, 54 per cent speak in Hindi, says draft NEP ### Published Jun 2, 2019, 6:14 am IST ### Updated Jun 2, 2019, 6:14 am IST ### Though English must also be available and taught in a high quality manner at all government and non-government schools. ### Though English must also be available and taught in a high quality manner at all government and non-government schools, the emphasis should be on functionality and fluency.(Image DC) ### Chennai: The draft New Education Policy, 2019, while making it mandatory to introduce three-language formula in all non-Hindi speaking states, says English is the language of the elite in the country who perpetrate the ‘colonial’ language. Hardly 15 per cent speak English while about 54 per cent speak Hindi. ### The NEP, which also raises the problems of teachers, particularly their deployment for non-teaching activities like conducting general elections or organising or supervising noon meal centres besides insufficient salaries and vacancies, states India faces over 10 lakh teacher vacancies - a large proportion of them in rural areas. ###  ### “Since Independence, the economic elite of India have adopted English as their language; only about 15 per cent of the country speaks English, and this population almost entirely coincides with the economic elite (compared with, e.g. 54 per cent of Indians who speak Hindi). Furthermore, the elite often use English (whether deliberately or inadvertently) as a test for entry into the elite class and for the jobs that they control: English is regularly used by the elite as a criterion to determine whether someone is “educated”, and perhaps most unfortunately of all, as a prerequisite for jobs - even in cases of jobs where knowledge of English is entirely irrelevant. This sad scenario and attitude (again, it may well be inadvertent) has resulted in the marginalisation of large sections of society based on language, keeping them out of higher-paying jobs and the higher socio-economic strata,” the draft policy states. ### Though English must also be available and taught in a high quality manner at all government and non-government schools, the emphasis should be on functionality and fluency. The medium of instruction, and the depth of study of literature, arts, and culture in the Indian context should be conducted and explored to the extent possible through the local language/ mother tongue and other Indian languages. ### Continuation of the three language formula in schools: The three language formula, followed since 1968 will be continued, keeping in mind the Constitutional provisions and aspirations of the people, regions, and the Union. It will need to be implemented in its spirit throughout the country, promoting multilingual communicative abilities for a multilingual country, the NEP says. ### ...",60119,1,"Though English must also be available and taught in a high quality manner at all government and non-government schools, the emphasis should be on functionality and fluency.

Quanell X said that Vence told him he dumped her body in Arkansas. ### Sheriff James Singleton in Arkansas' Hempstead County said workers found the bag, which had a foul odor coming from it, near Hope, about 30 miles northeast of the Texas-Arkansas border. ### Singleton said the medical examiner's office in Little Rock likely will have to identify the remains. ### ""If this is the little girl, we want to make sure that we treat it with respect and dignity,"" Singleton said. ### At a news conference in Houston, Executive Assistant Police Chief Troy Finner said authorities won't be able to confirm if the remains are those of Maleah until an autopsy is performed. ### It was unclear how long the identification process would take, Finner said. ### ""Do we believe that it's possibly her? Yes. But can we confirm it right now? No,"" Finner said. ### Finner said Maleah's family had been notified of Friday's developments in the case and he expects a murder charge will be filed in the case. ### ""We are here to make sure that little angel receives some justice and whoever is responsible we are going to hold them accountable,"" he said. ### Vence, 27, had claimed he, Maleah and his 2-year-old son were abducted on May 4 by a group of men in a truck. He said he and his son were freed the next day but the kidnappers kept Maleah and his silver Nissan Altima. Police said Vence's story kept changing and didn't add up. ### Police arrested Vence and charged him with tampering with evidence, specifically a human corpse. He remains jailed on a $40,000 bond. ### Quanell X said that during his jail visit, Vence told him Maleah is dead and he confessed he dumped the girl's body in Arkansas off the side of a road. Quanell X declined to comment on what Vence told him regarding how Maleah had died. ### ""One thing he wanted to make clear to me was what happened to Maleah was an accident,"" Quanell X said. ### In a statement, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said her office has spoken with Vence's attorney and there is no agreement in the case. ### ""We continue to work with the Houston Police Department to bring justice for Maleah Davis,"" Ogg said. ### Dorian Cotlar, Vence's attorney, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. ### On Friday, Cotlar filed a motion in court asking a judge to prohibit Quanell X from visiting Vence in jail, where he remains held on a $45,000 bond. ### Quanell X had previously spoken on behalf of Brittany Bowens, Maleah's mother, but said he stopped being her spokesman because of inconsistencies in her story. ### Child Protective Services removed Maleah and her brothers from the apartment Vence and Bowens shared in August after the girl suffered a head wound, but the children were returned in February, according to an agency spokeswoman. ### Bowens could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday. ### Earlier in May, Bowens told KRIV-TV she loved her children and it was ""absurd"" that anybody would think she had anything to do with Maleah's disappearance or with hurting her. ### After a canceled court appearance by Vence on May 13, Bowens was heckled outside the courtroom by people who questioned if she had done enough to protect her daughter before her disappearance. ### Never miss a story ### Choose the plan that's right for you. ### Digital access or digital and print delivery.",60119,1,"At a news conference in Houston, Executive Assistant Police Chief Troy Finner said authorities won't be able to confirm if the remains are those of Maleah until an autopsy is performed.###It was unclear how long the identification process would take, Finner said.###"" Do we believe that it's possibly her?

So far, her favorite book from the library has been Saffy's Angel, a story that follows the adventures of a young girl. Kylie, 7, said she hopes to find more fun books to read this summer and share them with her friends. ### The library was built by Josh and Jarod Phillips, who are graphic designers by trade. They wanted to bring something new and creative to their Spartanburg neighborhood. ### ""You see a lot of these in New Orleans made with converted tree trunks,"" Josh Phillips said. ""My brother made the box a year ago, and I painted it to look good. I wanted it to be off the road some so kids could use it safely. The kids have been over here everyday looking for books."" ### A brick path from Holly Drive to the library provides a safe path for visitors to use with solar lights guiding the way at night. A bench constructed near the library lets readers rest awhile while they flip through the pages of their favorite book. ### Quotes from authors including J.M. Barrie of Peter Pan are painted on the library box in blue and yellow. The only thing left to add to the library is flowers along the walkway. ### ""I really hope people enjoy it,"" Phillips said. ""Everybody has been stopping by trying to figure out what it is. I loved how it turned out."" ### Those who want to pick up a book from the library are asked to drop a book off in return. Some book titles include works by Edgar Allen Poe and J.M. Barrie. The library box is also filled with some of Phillip's favorite comics including Marvel Infinity War and Dragon Ball Z. ### The library at 276 Holly Drive was constructed in Phillips' front yard. He hopes the idea catches on in other neighborhoods across the city. ### Sarah Lehmann of Holly Drive said her children have enjoyed using it since it opened this week. ### ""It makes the neighborhood look a lot nicer, and you can sit up on the bench and read a book especially if you go out for a walk or a jog,"" Lehmann said.

11989,"Brightburn ###  ###  ### Cast: Elizabeth Banks, David Denman, Jackson A. Dunn, Matt Jones, Meredith Hagner Director: David Yarovesky Time: 125 minutes Genre: Horror Age Restriction: 16 HLV Release Date: May 31, 2019 ### WHAT IT'S ABOUT: ### What if a child from another world crash-landed on Earth, but instead of becoming a hero to mankind, he proved to be something far more sinister? ### WHAT WE THOUGHT: ### What if Superman was evil? This is the question that is explored by the filmmakers of horror Brightburn, created by James Gunn’s cousin and brother but directed by a relative unknown David Yarovesky. It poses a question of nurture vs nature, and how easy it might have been for the most powerful superhero to turn into a nightmarish villain, fuelled by a superiority complex and lack of empathy. ### This could have been a great genre-twisting film, an almost pop culture essay on the superhero popularity that has been jumpstarted and sustained by Marvel (and to some extent DC). Unfortunately, it lacks a depth of character development and willingness to explain certain concepts to its audience. However, this could all be down to the fact that South Africa has a different, less gory cut than America’s R-Rated version. ### Young adopted Brandon Breyer about to turn 12-years-old starts discovering his powers and questions his identity, but instead of harnessing his abilities for good, he starts down a path of terror. ### The similarities to Superman’s origins is strong from the get-go - right down to his farmer parents from Kansas. And beyond the graphic horror and general psychopathy, it terrifyingly shows how easy it would have been for Clark Kent to use his abilities to shut down bullies, get what he wants and generally mess up his parents if they decided to discipline him just a little. In terms of the horror element, it’s eye-gauging, with some scenes where you literally have to look away because someone’s jaw was popping off their face. While fully embracing the horror element, it wasn’t a traditional horror - you knew who the perpetrator was - and instead focused on using the actor to instil fear rather than some cheap jumpscares. ### But unfortunately, Brightburn is a movie that could have been great - but wasn’t. The biggest flaw was the complete lack of character development. Brandon, played by newcomer Jackson A. Dunn, is shown at the beginning as a sweet boy that loves his parents but feels a little awkward at school. When he starts to turn into a murderous psychopath, the change is instant. No opportunities were given to let Brandon struggle with his newfound identity, grappling between the human emotions he was nurtured with and his conquering alien-nature. The same can be said for his father, whereas his mother, played by the amazing Elizabeth Banks, is the only one with a decent story arc. Playing into these emotional rollercoasters would have elevated the film to the status of The Conjuring and Deadpool , even potentially getting it the dark universe that Yarovesky wants (imagine a horror version of the Justice League ). But what we got was ‘meh’. ### Brightburn was a film with grande potential, possibly creating a new genre to accompany the superhero schtick, but while it wasn’t terrible and still a good watch, it struggled with the same lack of emotional intensity as its hero - or in this case - villain. ### Share This",60119,1,"######Cast: Elizabeth Banks, David Denman, Jackson A.

19892,"DuVernay says watch ‘When They See Us’ at your own pace ### May 31, 2019 at 7:48 am ### Updated June 1, 2019 at 3:22 am ### By ### LINDSEY BAHR ### The Associated Press ### LOS ANGELES (AP) — Netflix is made for bingeing, but filmmaker Ava DuVernay thinks that audiences should watch her Central Park Five miniseries “When They See Us ” at their own pace. ### The four-part series explores the true story of five black and Latino teenagers from Harlem who were coerced into confessing to a rape they didn’t commit in 1989 and follows them over the course of 25 years. It’s currently available to Netflix subscribers. ### DuVernay said the viewing experience will be different for everyone. ### “I think it really is going to depend on where you are politically and culturally,” she said in an interview last month. “For some people this is all going to be new, like, ‘Wait, what?’ And for other people it’s deeply felt because they’ve experienced it in their lives as people of color or people who faced injustice.” ### While many might choose to watch all five hours in one sitting, the “Selma” filmmaker knows that method might now work for all. ### “I shared it with a bunch of people and some people really need to take breaks after and some people want to power through,” DuVernay said. ### She experienced something similar when her Oscar-nominated prison system documentary “13th” hit the streaming service in 2016. ### Advertising ### “There were people that couldn’t watch that straight through and it was only 100 minutes,” she said. “But Netflix gives you the luxury of being able to do it in a space and at a time when you’re comfortable. It’s always there. And I think that’s what this offering is. Hopefully people will engage with it where and when they want.” ### The storytelling itself is intended to be a little unconventional, even for people immersed in true crime stories. DuVernay wanted to blend aspects of the “crime drama” and the “family drama” genres to “really dig into truth and justice.” ### “A lot of the crime dramas deal with the sensational element. They deal with the spectacle of the crime, the spectacle of the loss. Family dramas usually have nuance or are a bit slower,” she said. “I tried to put those together in a way that I don’t feel I’ve seen a lot of, especially applied to black people.” ### She also hopes that those inclined to watch things like “The Night Of” and “Making a Murderer” will want to dig into this story in a similar way. ### “This is true. This is real. This has political repercussions. Can we apply that genre of the crime drama that’s become so popular now and in the limited series format and apply that to a case that has real world stakes even now?” DuVernay said. “I don’t know what the answer is. We’ll see.” ### LINDSEY BAHR",60119,1,"“ I think it really is going to depend on where you are politically and culturally,” she said in an interview last month. “ For some people this is all going to be new, like, ‘ Wait, what? ’ And for other people it’s deeply felt because they’ve experienced it in their lives as people of color or people who faced injustice. ”","[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]","<p>“ I think it really is going to depend on where you are politically and culturally,” she said in an interview last month. “ For some people this is all going to be new, like, ‘ Wait, what? ’ And for other people it’s deeply felt because they’ve experienced it in their lives as people of color or people who faced injustice. ”</p>",820

34492,"NBA Draft 2019:  Tacko Falls, Isaiah Roby, and 2nd-Round Scouting ### Email ### Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images ### Despite not having a 1st round pick in the 2019 NBA Draft , the King s have been busy; they’ve worked out 36 players , a number that will likely double as we get closer to June 20th. With three second rounders—the 40th, 47th, and 60th overall selections—the Kings are casting a large scouting net this year. And as ESPN’s Jonathan Givony pointed out, there’s a larger pool of underclass talent to scout this year than in previous draft classes. ### 17 college seniors and international players are currently projected to be drafted according to our latest forecast, leaving 43 spots for NCAA underclassmen. It appears that around 100 underclassmen will leave their names in the draft. Some folks will be disappointed on June 20th ### — Jonathan Givony (@DraftExpress) May 29, 2019 ### It’s utter folly to try and predict how the 2nd round of any draft (especially this one) will go, but a decent number of the players the Kings have worked out will end up being undrafted free agents and/or summer league tryouts. Still, there are a couple bigger names that deserve extra attention. ### Isaiah Roby is the best prospect the Kings have worked out so far. The bouncy Nebraska Cornhusker has the length (7’1 wingspan), footspeed, and hops to make him a promising swing forward, even if his inconsistencies as a shooter (33% from deep this season on 84 attempts, and 29.7% on all jump shots in the half-court, per Synergy Sports) might keep him from being a real answer on the wing. But if you’re questioning his athletic ability, well... ### Roby’s best on offense when he can get a straight line to the basket, and he’d thrive in Sacramento’s fast pace, grab-the-ball-and-freaking-go system. If his shot ever moves from meh to acceptable, he could fit a huge need for the Kings roster that’s still devoid of forward talent. ### The biggest allure for Roby is his abilities on the defensive end, where he was just one of four players this season to snag 40 steals and 60 blocks (the list includes noted defensive titans Brandon Clarke and Matisse Thybulle ). He’s active and a quick help defender , and assuming he builds on the 214 pounds he weighed at the combine, he could provide a switchable bench defender... something the Kings desperately need more of. ### Tacko Fall is the biggest name the Kings have worked out, which is fitting for a 7’7 giant. Through the combination of his size and awesome name, he’s garnered a ton of attention for a fringe-2nd round player. With a 10’2” standing reach, he’s the life-size version of our 10-year-old selfs when we played with a nerf hoop on our bedroom doors. His 8’2.25” wingspan (longest on record since Manute Bol, 8’6”) is a half-foot longer than fellow-combine attendee Bol Bol (Manute’s son), who finished at 7’7. Look up at that absurd picture above; he’s more than a foot taller than this class’ generational talent. At some level, that height is going to be a benefit for an NBA team—that upside was captured in these back-to-back plays against Zion Williamson and Duke in the NCAA tournament. ### The downsides to Fall are stark; he’s not an NBA-level athlete and would be left in the dust on both ends of the court. At some level, his length will compensate for this—and experts noted that Fall’s athletic testing at the combine exceeded expectations ( the Athletic’s Sam Vecinie says that Fall has grown from “being a non-athlete to merely a below-average one”)—but it’s key to point out that from the last ten years of combine results, only Jared Sullinger had a slower 3⁄4 court sprint time (3.8) than Tacko (3.78). Whatever level of competition he plays, teams will try to get Tacko into space until he proves he’s quick and cerebral enough to handle it. ### There’s also the question of what to do with him on offense. Watch this play from the tournament contest against Duke. ### Fall is not a skilled player. In this one play, we see his poor hands (2.9 turnovers per 40 and a 17.2% turnover rate, vast improvements over his 4.8 per 40 and 25% rate from 2017-18), his general lack of coordination, and the absence of real post instincts. There’s no way Duke’s Javin DeLaurier (6’10) should have been able to block that shot, except Fall basically did the work for him. And it gets worse when defenses collapse on Fall; when he gets double-teamed in the post, Fall turns the ball over 30% of the time, per Synergy. The final and biggest concern is Fall’s 43.2% clip from the free throw stripe—even with the newer efforts to curtail intentional fouls, what’s the offensive value of a put-back focused big if he’s going to be Wacko-Tacko-ed every time he’s on the court in the not-last-two-minutes of a quarter? ### Taking Fall with that 60th pick isn’t a bad outcome for the Kings—I’m not sure even the Kings could KANGZ up a 60th overall pick—but Fall wouldn’t be the 3rd big the Kings are looking for to build around Marvin Bagley and Harry Giles. He’d provide some needed rim protection skills, but he’s a situational big in a league that loves attacking players with his weaknesses. ### Dedric Lawson is another relevant name; the 6’8” All-American was the MVP and key stabilizing force for an unstable Kansas team. Lawson’s abilities as a low-post scorer (19.4 PPG), glass cleaner (10.3 RPG), and range (39.3% on 89 three point attempts) helped the Jayhawks weather both the midseason losses of Udoka Azubuike (injury) and Lagerald Vick (personal reasons). ### He’s got length (7’2 wingspan) to cover up for only-ok size for a power forward (6’7 without shoes), but if he doesn’t get drafted, it will be because he’s a below-average NBA athlete; his 3⁄4 court sprint, shuttle run, and vertical leap tests were all near the bottom of the combine, and he actually has a lower max-vertical (26”) than Tacko (26.5”). Without great instincts defensively, there’s a big question as to how he’ll defend at the NBA level. ### Some other interesting players or tidbits from the Kings workouts include: ### Jaylen Hoard became the first one-and-done player in Wake Forest’s history. The 6’9” forward is a fluid and bouncy athlete, and posted an impressive 13.1 PPG and 7.4 RPG in his freshman season. But he’s a longer-term upside play, as his shot hasn’t yet materialized—he shot just 23.8% on all half-court jumpshots this season, per Synergy, and sank just 22.6% of his 53 three point attempts. ### Through their workouts so far , the Kings have mainly scouted guards, stretch bigs (Roby, Lawson), and centers (Fall and Duke’s Marques Bolden ). The Kings have surprisingly only worked out a handful of players who could be considered traditional small forwards; Hoard , V.J. King (Louisville), and Dean Wade (Kansas State) remained in the draft, while Lamar Stevens (Penn State) and Yoeli Childs (BYU) returned to school. It’ll be key to see how the Kings handle their workout invites now that the draft class is set, but their early workouts support the idea that Sacramento believes their biggest needs are backup guards and bigs. ### The Kings have worked out 36 players, including 11 collegiate players who had left school after their senior seasons. Of the 25 underclassmen, only 10— Armoni Brooks (Houston), Aubrey Dawkins (UCF), Amir Hinton (Shaw University), Amir Coffey (Minnesota), Roby, Fall, Lawson, Bolden , King, and Hoard have kept their names in the draft. The rest returned to to school. ### If you want a easy-to-read way to compare expert draft boards, our buddy Brett Huff has continued his awesome chart. ### ESPN and Sam Vecenie posted some updates to their draft boards post-withdrawal deadline. Players the Kings have/will work out are underlined. Their rank when sorted by my weight formula: ### Isaiah Roby: 38",60119,1,"Tacko Fall is the biggest name the Kings have worked out, which is fitting for a 7’7 giant.

On Friday night, he experienced his own beer shower for the first time. ### Bruce hit his 300th career home run to join a fairly exclusive group, Tom Murphy hit a two-run shot, and the Seattle Mariners beat the Los Angeles Angels 4-3. ### ""You know, a personal beer shower, that's probably my first one,"" Bruce said. ""It's good. Cold — it's very cold. If you had told me I was going to hit my 300th home run playing first base for the Seattle Mariners, I probably would have called you crazy."" ### Bruce's seventh-inning homer to center field provided the insurance run the Mariners needed to preserve the narrow victory, snapping a three-game losing streak. Bruce, who was an outfielder for much of his career, became the eighth active player with 300 home runs and 300 doubles (he's got 301), achieved in 1,557 games. That list includes teammate Edwin Encarnacion (a late scratch due to a root canal) and the Angels' Albert Pujols. ### The win snapped the Angels' three-game winning streak and wasted a fairly strong start by Tyler Skaggs (4-5), who struck out eight and gave up just five hits but made a handful of costly mistakes while giving up four runs in seven innings. ### Skaggs' first mistake came a few pitches after Murphy doubled off the top of the wall in the third inning for the Mariners' first hit. Home plate umpire Lance Barksdale called a balk on Skaggs and sent Murphy to third. He easily scored on Dylan Moore's single for a 1-0 lead. ### Skaggs messed up again in the fifth when he walked Bruce with two outs. Murphy then homered to right field for a 3-0 lead. ### ""It's extremely frustrating,"" Skaggs said. ""I thought I was really, really good and the results didn't show up. But at the same time, a lot of positives today. I really, really felt like it was the best I looked this year and (I want to) keep it rolling into the next one."" ### The Angels briefly got to Mike Leake (4-6) in the sixth inning when Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani hit back-to-back home runs to left field with two outs. It was the first time Los Angeles has hit consecutive home runs this season, but it wasn't enough for the Angels. ### Leake was otherwise flawless. He retired 14 of the first 15 batters he faced, didn't issue a walk against two strikeouts and scattered five hits in seven innings. He didn't allow a base runner other than Trout and Ohtani past first base. ### Servais thought it was Leake's best game in quite some time. ### ""Mike's a feel guy and he was feeling the breaking ball all night,"" he said. ### The Mariners' bullpen again struggled after Leake left. Reliever Austin Adams walked two players after starting the eighth with a popout. Servais went to Jesse Biddle, who allowed Ohtani to single in a run to cut the lead to 4-3. Biddle followed by walking Kole Calhoun to load the bases. Anthony Bass came on and induced a fly ball to end the threat and pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to earn his first save. He's one of seven Seattle relievers with at least one save this season. ### The Mariners, league leaders in errors, also got pristine defense with Murphy picking off a runner and Mitch Haniger making a diving catch in right field in the seventh, and Kyle Seager snatching up a slow roller barehanded in the ninth with a snap throw. Bass finished off the game with a strikeout. ### × ### ""Bass really picked us up tonight,"" Servais said. ""He hasn't been with the ballclub very long but I like what he does. He doesn't' give in."" ### BRUCE'S BALL ### Bruce hopes to get his home run ball back from the fan who caught it Friday night. He managed to track down home runs No. 100 and No. 200 after he hit them as well. ### ""Honestly, I couldn't tell you where those are right now, but they're in my house,"" Bruce joked. ### MOUND MOVES ### Angels: Reliever John Curtiss was recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake City and RHP Jake Jewell was optioned to make room a day after he pitched 2 2/3 innings of scoreless relief against the Mariners. The team also designated RHP Matt Ramsey for assignment. Ausmus would not confirm that minor leaguer Jose Suarez will start Sunday's game in Seattle in place of regular starter Trevor Cahill, who will be pushed back a day. ### Mariners: Servais sat down with LHP Yusei Kikuchi on Friday, a day after his second straight difficult start. The two talked over how the Japanese rookie felt and how he might be used going forward. Kikuchi could make another abbreviated start of one inning next week or he could be pulled for one spin of the rotation. That decision will probably come Saturday. ### Seattle continued to tinker with its bullpen Friday, recalling RHP Chasen Bradford from Triple-A Tacoma. He's had 10 major league relief appearances this season with one save and one hold. The Mariners optioned David McKay back to Tacoma to make room. ### UP NEXT ### Angels: LHP Andrew Heaney (0-0, 3.60 ERA) will make his second start of the season and first on the road after returning from elbow inflammation. ### Mariners: LHP Tommy Milone (1-1, 3.38 ERA) tries for his second consecutive win after striking out seven and allowing four hits in a 6-2 win over Texas. ### ———",60119,1,"1 of 12###Seattle Mariners' Jay Bruce hits a solo home run off of Los Angeles Angels starting pitcher Tyler Skaggs during the seventh inning of a baseball game Friday, May 31, 2019, in Seattle.

The deadline expired at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Saturday. ### The tariff increase affects a broad range of consumer goods and intermediate components from China including internet modems and routers, printed circuit boards, furniture, vacuum cleaners and lighting products. ### Earlier on Saturday, China began collecting higher retaliatory tariffs on much of a $60-billion target list of US goods. The tariffs, announced on May 13 and taking effect midnight in Beijing, apply additional 20 percent or 25 percent tariffs on more than half of the 5,140 US products targeted. Beijing had previously imposed additional rates of 5 percent or 10 percent on the targeted goods. ### No further trade talks between top Chinese and US negotiators have been scheduled since the last round ended in a stalemate on May 10, the same day Trump announced higher tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods and then took steps to levy duties on all remaining Chinese imports. ### China ordered the latest tariff increases in response to Trump's move. ### Trump has accused China of breaking a deal to settle their trade dispute by reneging on earlier commitments made during months of negotiations. China has denied the allegations. ### Beijing has grown more strident in recent weeks, accusing Washington of lacking sincerity and vowing that it will not cave to the Trump administration's demands. ### Its rhetoric has hardened particularly since Washington put Chinese company Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. on a blacklist that effectively bans the firm from doing business with US companies.",60119,1,"Posted at Jun 01 2019 01:20 PM###Share###LinkedIn###WASHINGTON - The United States began collecting higher 25 percent tariffs on many Chinese goods arriving in US seaports on Saturday morning in an intensification of the trade war between the world's 2 largest economies and drawing retaliation from Beijing.###US President Donald Trump imposed the tariff increase on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods on May 10, but had allowed a grace period for sea-borne cargoes that departed China before that date, keeping them at the prior, 10 percent duty rate.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]","<p>Posted at Jun 01 2019 01:20 PM</p><p>Share</p><p>LinkedIn</p><p>WASHINGTON - The United States began collecting higher 25 percent tariffs on many Chinese goods arriving in US seaports on Saturday morning in an intensification of the trade war between the world's 2 largest economies and drawing retaliation from Beijing.</p><p>US President Donald Trump imposed the tariff increase on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods on May 10, but had allowed a grace period for sea-borne cargoes that departed China before that date, keeping them at the prior, 10 percent duty rate.</p>",826

Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and the like, don’t care about those regional, cultural and social differences. ### This begs the question — why is a disaster relief bill even being debated? ### One of the most important functions of government, as many have observed through the years since 1776, is to serve the needs of the people it governs. ### The $19 billion disaster relief bill that has been crawling through Congress has been caught in a political quagmire. The bill would deliver long-sought relief to farmers, victims of hurricanes and floods, and rebuild military bases. ### The bill has one of the most noble intentions, of the government providing aid and assistance to its citizens. ### Disaster aid measures are usually among the few reliably bipartisan pieces of legislation left in an increasingly partisan Washington. But these are not usual days. ### The dissenting lawmakers argue that such a massive emergency aid package should not be passed without a recorded vote and that the funding should be offset by other spending reductions, rather than increasing the federal deficit. ### They also contend that the president’s $4.5 billion request for extra border security funding should be included. ### Border security and aid to those affected by hurricanes, wildfires and the like are two items that should not be lumped into one package by Congress. ### But these are not usual days. ### When Congress reaches the point where its members cannot distinguish the role of leadership or partisanship, it can be disappointing. ### But we’ve all been disappointed for quite a while now. ### Six years ago, when Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast, several lawmakers voted against a $50 billion-plus Superstorm Sandy relief bill that passed Congress, accusing Democrats of swelling the measure with bloat. ### We don’t know which is worse, voting against a relief measure because it doesn’t fund other projects or voting against a measure because it includes items that are not relief related. ### So, we ask, what goal are those blocking members of Congress pursuing? To work for the people or continue their position in their respective parties. ### We can understand voting against, and even blocking, legislation because the congressman or senator feels it is not in the best interests of constituents. But to pull together two unrelated items? ### It would be, from what we’ve seen, hard for us to imagine the majority of their constituents would be against disaster aid. Not from what we’ve seen from communities across the country who offered support and assistance in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. ### The disaster bill will eventually pass.

The units will then have to be inspected by the state again before they can reopen. ### The hospital’s three behavioral health units have about 70 beds total, although they weren’t all filled at the time of the closure, Jolie said. Fewer than 10 patients were transferred to other facilities, while the rest were transferred to other inpatient areas of the hospital until they could be safely discharged. ### false",60119,1,"CHICAGO (Sun-Times Media Wire) - Rush University Medical Center’s inpatient mental health units remain closed to patients two months after they were closed to address safety issues raised by state inspectors.###State officials touring Rush’s Behavioral Health units in late March found multiple “ligature” risks in patient rooms — features that could be used by patients to hang or strangle themselves, according to an Illinois Department of Public Health inspection report completed on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.###Rush spokesman Charlie Jolie said the inspectors were looking into reports of a suicide attempt at the hospital in late March.###The state’s report details a March 16 incident in which a woman admitted to the hospital for suicidal ideations tried to stab herself in the neck with a ballpoint pen.###Jolie said the hospital was already planning on renovating the units to bring them into compliance with state and federal ligature risk regulations, but decided to close the units on March 30 to “accelerate the construction” and address the issues identified by inspectors.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]","<p>CHICAGO (Sun-Times Media Wire) - Rush University Medical Center’s inpatient mental health units remain closed to patients two months after they were closed to address safety issues raised by state inspectors.</p><p>State officials touring Rush’s Behavioral Health units in late March found multiple “ligature” risks in patient rooms — features that could be used by patients to hang or strangle themselves, according to an Illinois Department of Public Health inspection report completed on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>Rush spokesman Charlie Jolie said the inspectors were looking into reports of a suicide attempt at the hospital in late March.</p><p>The state’s report details a March 16 incident in which a woman admitted to the hospital for suicidal ideations tried to stab herself in the neck with a ballpoint pen.</p><p>Jolie said the hospital was already planning on renovating the units to bring them into compliance with state and federal ligature risk regulations, but decided to close the units on March 30 to “accelerate the construction” and address the issues identified by inspectors.</p>",829

25960,"Judge allows Missouri's last abortion clinic to remain open ### Share: ### ABCNews ### By ENJOLI FRANCIS ### A circuit court judge ruled Friday that Missouri's only remaining abortion clinic can continue performing the procedure. ### If St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer had not approved Planned Parenthood's request for a temporary restraining order, the clinic's license would have lapsed and it would have been forced to close Friday night at midnight, making Missouri the first state in the nation without an abortion provider. ### With the temporary restraining order granted to allow the clinic to stay open, there will be another hearing on June 4, Stelzer said in his ruling. Stelzer also clarified in his ruling that it was only on the question of a restraining order, not on any other part of the issue at hand. ### ""Today is a victory for women across Missouri, but this fight is far from over,"" Dr. Leana Wen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement. ""We have seen just how vulnerable access to abortion care is here-and in the rest of the country."" ### The ruling is ""a huge sigh of relief,"" Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an OB-GYN at the Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, said in a statement. ### ""Our doors are open today, our doors will be open tomorrow, and we will fight to make sure all patients continue to receive the care they need and deserve,"" McNicholas said. ### With the fate of Missouri 's lone Planned Parenthood clinic in the balance demonstrators marched at the St. Louis Gateway Arch and at state government offices in an ongoing fight for abortion rights in the state on Thursday. ### ""What do we do? Stand up, fight back!"" they chanted. ### State health officials had refused to renew the St. Louis clinic's license until doctors agree to interviews about what Gov. Mike Parson is calling ""a series of deficiencies."" ### ""It's shame on Missouri politicians and government for weaponizing the licensing and regulatory process to end safe and legal abortion in Missouri,"" said M'Evie Mead, director of Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri. ""People should have access to safe, legal abortion in this state."" ### Planned Parenthood officials announced Tuesday they were filing a lawsuit for a restraining order to stop the state from closing the clinic , which is located in St. Louis. ### The organization said it had applied to have the license renewed, but the Associated Press reported that Planned Parenthood said state officials claimed they are investigating ""a large number of possible deficiencies,"" though no further details were given. ### The state had asked to interview all seven of the clinic's physicians, Planned Parenthood said Tuesday, but the state would not provide any guidance on what the doctors would be asked during the interviews. Those interviews could lead to the doctors losing their medical licenses or possible criminal prosecution, Planned Parenthood said. ### Missouri is one of several states that have passed abortion bans in recent months. Last week, Gov. Parsons signed an abortion ban after 8-weeks of pregnancy, though it has not yet taken effect, and was met with immediate legal challenges. ### Less than 24 hours ago, lawmakers in Louisiana passed new abortion restrictions that outlaw the procedure as early as 6 weeks into a pregnancy. On Thursday, the state's governor -- a Democrat -- signed the bill into law. It has not yet gone into effect, and will be challenged in court. ### ABC News' Meghan Keneally and Alexandra Svokos contributed to the reporting in this story.",60119,1,""" Today is a victory for women across Missouri, but this fight is far from over,"" Dr. Leana Wen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement.

23209,"© 2019 The Indian Express Ltd. ### All Rights Reserved ### Advertising ### It’s going great for Richard Madden. That’s what worries him ### In the musical Rocketman, Richard Madden plays a cunning music manager whose seduction of Elton John extends past the boardroom and into the bedroom. It’s a far cry from Madden’s best-known role as Robb Stark, the virtuous, doomed Game of Thrones character who perished during the show’s notorious Red Wedding episode. ### By New York Times |Written by Kyle Buchanan | Published: June 1, 2019 1:37:32 pm ### Related News ### Scottish actor Richard Madden’s star is on the rise (Source: Instagram/richardmadden). ### When it comes to award shows, always listen to Julianne Moore. ### Advertising ### Richard Madden knows this now, though he didn’t in January, when the Scottish actor found himself seated next to Moore at the Golden Globes. Madden had received his first Globe nomination for playing a British politician’s PTSD-stricken protection officer in the hit miniseries Bodyguard, and before the names in his category were read, Moore leaned over to strategize. ### “She was like, ‘OK, sweetie, if you win, do you want to come out behind me or do you want to go around the other way?’” Madden recalled. He responded incredulously: Of course he wouldn’t win. ### But he did. And as the orchestra began to play, Madden had no idea where to go. With a professional’s ease, Moore stood up, stepped back and coaxed Madden past her to the stage. “And then when I came back to the table after,” he said, “she was like, ‘I asked you which way you wanted to go!’” ### Advertising ### When it comes to navigating his path through Hollywood, the 32-year-old Madden prefers to figure it out on the fly. This week, you can catch him in the musical Rocketman, where Madden plays a cunning music manager whose seduction of Elton John extends past the boardroom and into the bedroom. It’s a far cry from Madden’s best-known role as Robb Stark, the virtuous, doomed Game of Thrones character who perished during the show’s notorious Red Wedding episode. ### That series only got bigger and bigger as it went on, but after his third-season exit, Madden was no longer around to partake in the spoils. Still, being killed off early has its benefits: It let Madden gradually age out of callow-prince roles and start playing complicated adult men. His role on Bodyguard last fall served as a reintroduction of sorts, a signal to the industry that Madden’s matinee-idol looks had grown gratifyingly flinty. Even his vulnerability now seemed dangerous. ### “I’m so used to playing the good guy that bad things happen to,” Madden told me in a Cannes hotel room this month, just days after Rocketman premiered at the film festival there. Initially tired from a day of doing press, Madden became warmer and more animated as he spoke, his blue eyes widening often for emphasis. “I was interested in playing a slightly darker character, with different motivations to him.” ### His Rocketman role, John Reid, lets Madden play the Machiavellian type with a jolt of sexual electricity: When Reid tells the young, untested Elton John, “You’re so humble, it’s embarrassing,” Madden makes his taunt sound like a come-on. ### Popular Photos ### CISF admit card 2019: Websites to check ### “What Richard has as an actor is great weight and assuredness,” said Taron Egerton, who plays Elton John in the film. “People call it sex appeal — and hell, there’s no doubt he has that — but it’s more than that. The sex appeal is a byproduct of his strength. You feel safe around him, because he has this certainty about things.” ### Ask Madden about that certainty, though, and he seems startled that anyone would think he possesses it. “You have to summon the strength to try and fake it,” he said. The character of John Reid may seem like a shark, but Madden conceived him as a big bluffer working hard to conceal his nerves, “because that echoed me on set, trying to be the cool character but actually panicking underneath.” ### Madden has felt that sense of precariousness since he was a child actor growing up outside Glasgow, where classmates teased him relentlessly for leaving school to pursue roles. Even when Madden got his big break on Game of Thrones, it came with a catch: Many of his co-stars were recast after the pilot was shot, an early reminder that “you’ve got to bring your best to this show, because it’s going to go on with or without you.” ### Eventually, the show did just that, though not before bestowing Madden with a level of fame that surprised him. “I thought it would just be like a niche, cult show,” Madden said. “I didn’t think it was going to be, like” — he paused to think of something appropriately huge — “‘Game of Thrones,’” he said finally. ### More Explained ### Sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib was a crime from the beginning of Sikhism ### Still, even that series couldn’t quite prepare Madden for the level of attention he’s received since Bodyguard debuted. A twisty, sexually charged action drama set against the war on terror, Bodyguard was a sensation in Britain when it came out last fall on the BBC (the show later debuted worldwide on Netflix), though Madden kept expecting the other shoe to drop. ### “You’re always waiting for it to fail, or go wrong,” he said. “I did it with every episode of ‘Bodyguard,’ thinking, ‘This will be the week where the audience turns on us and starts hating the show.’” ### They never did, and the frenzy kicked up by Bodyguard has led to new roles — Madden is soon to shoot the Sam Mendes-directed World War I drama 1917 and, it’s rumored, the Marvel movie The Eternals — as well as new scrutiny. Paparazzi attention has become so prevalent in London, where Madden lives much of the year, that his neighbors have started a group chat to warn the actor if any photographers are lingering outside. ### Tabloid interest in his personal life has increased, too: Madden, who was in a relationship with the actress Jenna Coleman until last year, has recently been photographed several times with the actor Brandon Flynn, who used to date the singer Sam Smith. Are the two men an item? ### Madden shrugged, unbothered by the question but in no hurry to answer it, either. “I just keep my personal life personal,” he said. “I’ve never talked about my relationships.” He’s working on a way to deter paparazzi interest in who he’s seen with: “I wear the same clothes days in a row, because if it looks like the same day, they can’t run the pictures,” he said. “There’s only so many photos you can have of me with a green juice walking down the street.” ### He knows, though, that some actors court that kind of attention. “I’ll be at hotels and restaurants where they’ll tell you, ‘There’s paparazzi in the front, do you want to go out the front or go out the back?’” Madden said. “And you go, ‘Who wants to go out the front?’ And they say, ‘Oh, quite a lot of people!’” ### Madden shook his head, laughing. He had been invited to the Vanity Fair party that night, one of the biggest see-and-be-seen soirees of the festival, but decided to beg off another night of flashbulbs and schmoozing. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” he explained. Instead, he’d opt for something more modest, satisfying no one’s appetite that night but his own. ### Advertising",60119,1,"Madden has felt that sense of precariousness since he was a child actor growing up outside Glasgow, where classmates teased him relentlessly for leaving school to pursue roles.

Remember, you can send me tips, suggestions and feedback to kate.clark@techcrunch.com or on Twitter  @KateClarkTweets . ### Here’s what I’ve been thinking about this week: Unicorn scarcity, or lack thereof. I’ve written about this concept before, as has my Equity co-host, Crunchbase News editor-in-chief Alex Wilhelm. I apologize if the two of us are broken records, but I think we’re equally perplexed by the pace at which companies are garnering $1 billion valuations. ### Here’s the latest data, according to Crunchbase : “2018 outstripped all previous years in terms of the number of unicorns created and venture dollars invested. Indeed, 151 new unicorns joined the list in 2018 (compared to 96 in 2017), and investors poured more than $135 billion into those companies, a 52% increase year-over-year and the biggest sum invested in unicorns in any one year since unicorns became a thing.” ### 2019 has already coined 42 new unicorns, like Glossier , Calm and Hims , a number that grows each and every week. For context, a total of 19 companies joined the unicorn club in 2013 when Aileen Lee, an established investor, coined the term . Today, there are some 450 companies around the globe that qualify as unicorns, representing a cumulative valuation of $1.6 trillion. 😲 ### We’ve clung to this fantastical terminology for so many years because it helps us classify startups, singling out those that boast valuations so high, they’ve gained entry to a special, elite club. In 2019, however, $100 million-plus rounds are the norm and billion-dollar-plus funds are standard. Unicorns aren’t rare anymore; it’s time to rethink the unicorn framework. ### Petition to stop using the term ""unicorn"" unless the company is valued at more than $1 billion *and* profitable. ### — Kate Clark (@KateClarkTweets) May 22, 2019 ### Last week, I suggested we only refer to profitable companies with a valuation larger than $1 billion as unicorns. Understandably, not everyone was too keen on that idea. Why? Because startups in different sectors face barriers of varying proportions. A SaaS company, for example, is likely to achieve profitability a lot quicker than a moonshot bet on autonomous vehicles or virtual reality. Refusing startups that aren’t yet profitable access to the unicorn club would unfairly favor certain industries. ### So what can we do? Perhaps we increase the valuation minimum necessary to be called a unicorn to $10 billion? Initialized Capital’s Garry Tan’s idea was to require a startup have 50% annual growth to be considered a unicorn, though that would be near-impossible to get them to disclose… ### While I’m here, let me share a few of the other eclectic responses I received following the above tweet. Joseph Flaherty said we should call profitable billion-dollar companies Pegasus “since [they’ve] taken flight.” Reagan Pollack thinks profitable startups oughta be referred to as leprechauns. Hmmmm. ### The suggestions didn’t stop there. Though I’m not so sure adopting monikers like Pegasus and leprechaun will really solve the unicorn overpopulation problem. Let me know what you think. Onto other news. ### Image by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images",60119,1,The suggestions didn’t stop there.

36618,"June 1, 2019 ### Image ### A perfect villain and an imperfect hero.CreditCreditIllustration by Jeffrey Henson Scales, photographs by Win McNamee/Getty Images and Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images ### WASHINGTON — When I was a political reporter at The Times, I had an editor who told me never to give anyone a Homeric epithet. ### Such epithets denote a permanent trait, the editor explained, and people in the caldron of politics were mutable. So if I called that Republican strategist “savvy” this week, the man might do something dumb the following week. (And that is exactly what happened.) ### But I might have to make an exception for William Barr. Homer had a couple of epithets that would suit our attorney general: “crooked-counseling” and “devious-devising” come to mind. ### In an interview in Alaska for “CBS This Morning,” Jan Crawford asked Barr — who was doing his best Cheneyesque dour-jowly-outdoorsman under the Big Sky routine — if he was worried about his reputation. ### Barr came into the job, Crawford said, with a good reputation on the right and the left and now he stands “accused of protecting the president, enabling the president, lying to Congress.” ### In Homer’s epic poems, reputation is more exalted than life itself. But in Donald Trump’s epic reign as the hotheaded, ammonia-haired, serpent-tongued destroyer of worlds, political survival is paramount, no matter the venality involved or the cost to your reputation. ### Barr responded to Crawford with fatalism, saying “everyone dies” and he doesn’t believe in “the Homeric idea” that immortality comes by “having odes sung about you over the centuries, you know?” ### It’s a good thing, too, because no one will be singing odes about this general being lionhearted in the rosy-fingered dawn. ### The twisty saga of Robert Mueller and Bill Barr is a case of an imperfect hero and a perfect villain. ### Barr is not so much the attorney general as the minister of information. His interview with Crawford was tactically brilliant. Barr once more deftly took advantage of the fact that Mueller, with his impenetrable legalese and double negatives, has handcuffed himself. ### Even when the reclusive and mute Mueller finally stepped up to the lectern on Wednesday, he was still hiding. ### “If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” said Mueller, sounding like Odysseus struggling to navigate between Scylla and Charybdis. “We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.” ### Mueller is as elliptical as Barr is diabolical. The special counsel is clearly frustrated that we don’t understand his reasoning. But his reasoning is nonsensical. ### Adding insult to injury, the man whose whole career has been about asking the tough questions wouldn’t even take questions. And he doesn’t want to deign to testify about his $35 million report. ### Mueller was trying to let himself off the hook by insisting that he couldn’t reach a conclusion on the president’s obstruction because he was bound by a Department of Justice opinion stating that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Plus, he layered on some extra “principles of fairness.” ### But talking to Crawford, Barr took the knife he had already stuck in his old friend and twisted it, using St. Mueller’s prestige against him. He said Mueller, in fact, was not barred from reaching a conclusion, and this is why a “surprised” Barr and his former deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had to step in and reach a conclusion on obstruction, one ending up favoring Trump. ### After indicating that Mueller was derelict and misguided, Barr went ahead and belittled him and his dream team as inept. ### Dismissively noting he and Rosenstein did not agree with a lot of the legal analysis in the Mueller report, Barr said he applied what he considered to be “the right law,” though he confusingly said he didn’t rely on that when pronouncing Mueller’s evidence “deficient” on the 11 instances of potential obstruction laid out in the report. ### When Barr moved on to his investigation of the investigators who worked on the case of possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, he really bared his claws. ### About the F.B.I. team that did the investigating, Barr backed up all of Trump’s deep-state rants, saying: “Republics have fallen because of Praetorian Guard mentality where government officials get very arrogant, they identify the national interest with their own political preferences and they feel that anyone who has a different opinion, you know, is somehow an enemy of the state.” He added, ominously, “Things are just not jiving.” ### Just as Barr enables Trump, Mueller enabled Barr. ### Mueller’s argument seems to be that he can’t report on what his facts mean because the president has immunity from prosecution. But that doesn’t follow. If you believe Trump committed a crime, even if you can’t indict him now, why not say so? Otherwise, what was the point of the investigation? All Mueller was asked to do was to describe what he found and give his conclusions; then the Justice Department and Congress could do what they wanted. ### As Walter Dellinger, an acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration, tweeted : “Everyone agrees a president can be indicted once he is out of office. That (in addition to impeachment) is a reason to gather the evidence now while docs are available and memories fresh.” ### But, tangled up in some overweening idea of fairness, the ultimate straight arrow decided to remain agnostic even though his job did not require agnosticism. And that made him weirdly complicit in Barr’s whitewashing of Trump. ### Mueller colored inside the lines and Barr seized the narrative. Rectitude was Mueller’s Achilles’ heel. ### Sometimes it’s hard to know who is worse: devils or saints. ### I invite you to follow me on Twitter ( @MaureenDowd ) and join me on Facebook .  ### A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SR11 of the New York edition with the headline: Lowering The Barr.

Mr. Laffer was an adviser to President Trump’s 2016 campaign.CreditCreditSaul Loeb/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images ### By Jim Tankersley ### May 31, 2019 ### WASHINGTON — President Trump will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, to the economist Arthur Laffer, whose tax-cutting enthusiasm has shaped decades of Republican policymaking, including Mr. Trump’s. ### The White House, which said Friday that it will convey the award on June 19, called Mr. Laffer “one of the most influential economists in American history.” ### Mr. Laffer, 78, was an adviser to Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, helping to craft the candidate’s tax plan, and a co-author of the recent book “Trumponomics,” which is a celebration of the president and nearly all of his economic programs. Mr. Laffer wrote the book with Stephen Moore, the conservative economist whom Mr. Trump wanted to nominate to the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Moore withdrew his name from consideration after Republican lawmakers, concerned about his views toward women, objected to his nomination. ### Mr. Laffer gained fame as the originator of the Laffer Curve, an illustration of the economic principle that holds that cutting tax rates can increase government revenues in certain situations. Mr. Laffer famously drew it on a napkin in a bid to sway President Gerald R. Ford to support tax cuts. ### He later helped write tax-cut legislation for President Ronald Reagan and advised candidates at all levels of government. His push for sweeping tax cuts to spur rapid economic growth dominated the policy proposals of the 2016 Republican field, and he has continued to advise Mr. Trump informally. ### Mr. Laffer was also an architect of the tax-cutting package that former Gov. Sam Brownback pushed through in Kansas. Mr. Laffer and his disciples, including Mr. Moore, insisted that it would jump-start growth and produce a windfall of tax revenue. It instead produced a huge shortfall in the state’s budget, prompting lawmakers to reverse most of the law. ### Democrats once sought Mr. Laffer’s advice — he advised Jerry Brown, the former California governor, during his failed 1992 presidential campaign. But in recent decades Democrats have largely moved away from Mr. Laffer, viewing him as an architect of tax handouts to the rich. ### Mr. Laffer has heaped praise on Mr. Trump for the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017 and for his steps to reduce federal regulation of business. A longtime proponent of free trade — he has called the North American Free Trade Agreement, enacted under President Bill Clinton, the equivalent of a huge tax cut — and an opponent of tariffs, he has played down his concerns with Mr. Trump’s policy of threatening and enacting tariffs as leverage in trade and immigration disputes with other countries. ### In a recent interview, Mr. Laffer said he had told the president what he told everyone about trade policy: “When you look at tariffs, they are very, very bad for the economy.” But he said he believed that Mr. Trump was using tariffs to pressure other countries to open their markets more freely. He called Mr. Trump a master negotiator and said he supported his policies. ### “I have no reason to second-guess the president on negotiation strategy,” Mr. Laffer said.",60119,1,"The economist Arthur Laffer with Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive.

PAWS (Pets Are Worth Saving) is making progress on its new facility on Dog Walk Road. ### The concrete floor was poured about two weeks ago. The ceiling was framed and metal ordered to finish it. Framing for the outer walls was completed on Thursday. On Friday, Bryant Waller and Josh Hileman of Waller Electric worked on wiring. ### “The walls are studded, thanks to Brian Newcomb and his guys, who are all wonderful,” Karee Sweitzer, president of PAWS, said. “When Bryant gets done with the electrical, we can finish the walls on the perimeter and put on the metal ceiling.” ### PAWS President Karee Sweitzer describes the areas that will be in the interior of the group's new building on Dog Walk Road in Anna. ### Marilyn Halstead, The Southern ### The group still has a lot to do before they can move pets into the facility. ### Sweitzer said they need donations or sponsors to cover some specific items, like toilets, sinks and appliances. She and other volunteers have done their research to determine what kinds of items they need to purchase. For example, they want Speed Queen washers and dryers. They had a set that lasted seven years. A set from a different manufacturer lasted only a year and a half. The Speed Queen brand is a better value overall, she said. ### “If anyone wants a sponsorship, we will have a list on Facebook,” Sweitzer said. Their Facebook page may be found at facebook.com/PAWSAnna . ### The concrete has to cure for 30 days. Then, it can be sealed. Once the walls are done and the bathrooms are installed, the pets can move to their new home. ### The new facility is 60 feet by 120 feet with room for an office, intake areas for dogs, cats and puppies, two meet-and-greet rooms, a cat room with several cat trees, a kitchen/laundry area, runs for dogs, a large play area that can be reconfigured to meet current needs, a storage area, storage room and a quarantine room. ### A representative from Illinois Department of Agriculture has visited and made some suggestions. ### “I’m going for functional. The walls may not be the prettiest, but they will be functional,” Sweitzer said. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### PAWS Place Adoption Center is currently housed in a remodeled gas station building. It is not ideal, but is workable. The new facility will be much better for animals and volunteers, she said. ### The new facility was a dream of longtime PAWS volunteer Penny South. She began working on plans about 20 years ago. Sweitzer joined the group in 2011 and caught the vision of a better shelter for animals. ### Josh Hileman and Bryant Waller of Waller electric work on wiring an outdoor area at PAWS new shelter and adoption facility on Dog Walk Road in Anna on Friday. ### Marilyn Halstead, The Southern ### In October 2016, Sweitzer and South told The Southern of their plans for a new 50-foot by 170-foot building with a projected cost of $1.6 million. Some people in Anna thought funding for the building was not attainable. ### A lot has changed since that time. A smaller building design replaced the original. South died on April 1, 2017. Construction on the new facility began in July 2017. Donations have steadily come to complete each phase of construction, and volunteers have stepped forward to help. ### “We have a lot of people pulling for us,” Sweitzer said. ### The group has received a couple of large donations, but the donors wish to remain anonymous. Sweitzer welcomes large donations, but she said small donations of $25, $50 or $100, and even $5 and $10 have made the building possible. ### “We have been blessed, but we don’t have enough money to finish it,” she said. “It’s amazing what has happened. When you believe in something, it gets contagious.” ### Sweitzer believes volunteers and donations will come in to finish the building. ### “It’s about more than us. Everybody who has worked out here leaves a piece of themselves,” Sweitzer said. “Without all the people who came before and all the people who donated, there would not be a PAWs or a new building,” Sweitzer said. ### Subscribe to Daily Headlines ### Sign up!

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic - ### Copyright ### Text size Aa Aa ### By Dado Ruvic ### VELIKAKLADUSA, Bosnia (Reuters) – Twenty-nine migrants were injured in a fire that broke out early on Saturday at a centre in the northwestern Bosnian town of Velika Kladusa, police said. ### Regional police spokesman Ale Siljdedic said the injured were taken to hospitals in Velika Kladusa and neighbouring Bihac following the fire at the Miral centre, which is used as temporary accommodation for about 500 migrants. ### The fire was put down during the course of the day but more than a hundred migrants were forced to stay outdoors braving rain and cold weather because the building’s upper floor was destroyed, a Reuters photographer said. ### An investigation into the cause of the fire was underway, police said. Police spokesman Siljdedic told Reuters the fire was most likely caused by a heater as temperatures had fallen overnight. ### The International Organisation for Migration (IOM), which manages the camp, said in a statement that eight people remained in hospital, two of them with serious but not life threatening injuries. ### Videos posted on social media showed several people jumping in panic out of the centre’s windows. ### Local doctors said that many of the injured suffered from limb fractures and only few of them from burns. IOM said its was ready to engage additional staff to put the building back into full use. ### About 25,000 people from Asia and North Africa entered Bosnia from Serbia and Montenegro last year, and about 6,000 have arrived in the impoverished Balkan country this year, according to Bosnia’s security agencies. ### Only around 3,500 have been accommodated in transit centres, leaving thousands sleeping rough. ### Most of the migrants are concentrated in Bihac and Velika Kladusa, where authorities say resources are overstretched. They have requested that the three transit centres there, including Miral, be closed and residents moved elsewhere. ### Ethnically-divided Bosnia has not formed a government seven months after a general election. State institutions in charge of migration and asylum issues are operating in a caretaking capacity. ### (Reporting by Maja Zuvela; Editing by William Maclean and Toby Chopra) ### euronews provides breaking news articles from reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.

58740,"Elephant Poaching Declines In Africa, but 15,000 Still Illegally Killed Each Year ### Posted by clnAdrian on May 31, 2019 in Environment , Wildlife with 0 Comments ### By Melissa Breyer | Treehugger ### Even though there has been notable progress, at current poaching rates elephants are still in danger of becoming virtually extinct on the continent. ### In 2011, the annual toll of poaching on Africa’s elephants peaked with a mortality rate of 10 percent of their population. Now, new research finds that poaching rates have started to decline; in 2017, the annual poaching mortality rate dropped to less than four percent. But it’s not good enough. ### While such a decline is good news, to be sure, the incredible pachyderms are not out of the woods yet. The team says that the continent’s elephant population remains threatened without continuing action to tackle poverty, reduce corruption, and decrease the demand for ivory. ### The study was conducted by an international group of scientists from the universities of Freiburg, York and the Convention for the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). They note that there are around 350,000 elephants left in Africa, but depressingly, between 10,000 to 15,000 are still killed each year by poachers. ### “At current poaching rates, elephants are in danger of being virtually wiped from the continent, surviving only in small, heavily protected pockets,” explains the  University of York  in a statement about the research. ### “We are seeing a downturn in poaching, which is obviously positive news, but it is still above what we think is sustainable so the elephant populations are declining,” says one of the study’s authors, Doctor Colin Beale, from the University of York’s Department of Biology. “The poaching rates seem to respond primarily to ivory prices in South-East Asia and we can’t hope to succeed without tackling the demand in that region.” ### “We need to reduce demand in Asia and improve the livelihoods of people who are living with elephants in Africa; these are the two biggest targets to ensure the long-term survival of elephants,” Beale adds. ### The researchers were unable to say how China’s ivory ban of 2017 may have affected the numbers. Ivory prices began to fall before the ban, which could be because of China’s slowing economy. ### Interestingly, however, is that rising ivory prices don’t seem to have an impact demand, yet “our results suggest supply changes strongly,” notes the study. Which is to say, the higher the price of ivory, the more the poaching. ### Poaching rates may be highest in the poorest regions, where the financial temptations of illegal activities are relatively greater, write the authors. Noting, “This has generated interest in community-based conservation programs that seek to tie conservation improvements directly to poverty alleviation and there is evidence this can reduce local poaching rates.” ### So there are a number of factors at play, but Paramount seems to be reducing demand for ivory while also reducing the poverty that leads to poaching. The two together make for a symbiotic relationship that is devastating to the elephants. So much money and effort are spent on anti-poaching enforcement, which is obviously important, but that doesn’t tackle the roots of the problem.",60119,1,"In 2011, the annual toll of poaching on Africa’s elephants peaked with a mortality rate of 10 percent of their population.

Google, the tech giant known universally for its search engine, also has fingers in a number of other pies, like online advertising, email messaging and video. Its dominance in the search arena has brought Google under intense scrutiny by regulators in the U.S. and abroad. But some of its other activities have been in the regulators' cross-hairs, as well. The U.S. Justice Department is readying an antitrust investigation of Google's business practices in search and other areas. Virginia Mayo, File AP Photo ### WASHINGTON ### Google, the tech giant known universally for its search engine, also has fingers in a number of other pies, like online advertising, email messaging and video. That gives U.S. antitrust enforcers, who have reportedly evinced a new interest in pursuing competition charges against Google, lots to look at. ### Governments around the world are becoming increasingly unnerved by the power amassed by major technology companies — with the dominance of Google in search, Facebook in social networking and Amazon in e-commerce raising the sharpest concerns. In the most dramatic scenario, a case might be made for breaking the companies into smaller pieces. ### The U.S. Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google's business practices in search and other areas, and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports. Neither the company nor the Justice Department will confirm or deny that a probe has been launched. The Federal Trade Commission, which shares competition oversight with Justice, made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action. ### The company made changes voluntarily after the FTC probe, including letting advertisers use information from their Google ad campaigns to create campaigns with rivals. But an FTC staff report released years later showed that the agency staff had urged the presidentially-appointed commissioners to bring a lawsuit against Google. That never happened. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to Sun Herald content across all your devices. ### It isn't clear what specific areas of Google's business the Justice Department might be probing. But here are some possible areas U.S. antitrust cops might poke into. ### ___ ### ADS ### Google commands the lead in digital ad revenue by a wide margin, controlling 31.1% of global digital ad dollars, according to eMarketer's 2019 estimates. Facebook is a distant second with 20.2%. ### European antitrust regulators slapped Google in March with a $1.7 billion fine for freezing out rivals in the online advertising business — the regulators' third big fine against the company in less than two years. ### Still, the latest penalty isn't likely to have much effect on Google's business. It applies to a narrow portion of Google's ad business in which Google sells ads next to Google search results on third-party websites. It involves practices the company says it already ended, and the amount is just a fraction of the $31 billion in profit that its parent, conglomerate Alphabet Inc., made last year. ### ___ ### SEARCH RESULTS ### Google's search engine handles two out of every three queries in the U.S. European regulators have found that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the lucrative e-commerce market, fining the company $2.8 billion. Google disputes those findings and is still appealing the 2017 decision. ### The FTC staff report released after the agency's investigation showed that the staff legal recommendations rejected by the commissioners involved allegations of Google tinkering with its search results in a way that stifled competition. ### Lawmakers from both parties appear determined to examine whether Google rigs its search results to also promote its own political agenda. ### ___ ### ANDROID ANTICS ### Another huge antitrust fine from the European overseers, $5 billion, came against Google in July 2018 for a finding that it abused the dominance of its Android operating system by forcing handset and tablet makers to install Google apps, reducing consumer choice. ### The company appealed the ruling and also made changes to avoid additional fines. It started this spring giving European Union smartphone users a choice of browsers and search apps on Android. Following an Android update, users will be shown two new screens giving them the new options. ### Android users who open the Google Play store after the update will be given the option to install as many as five search apps and five browsers.

LOUIS -- A judge issued an order Friday to keep Missouri's only abortion clinic operating over the objections of state health officials, delivering abortion-rights advocates a courtroom victory after a string of setbacks in legislatures around the U.S. ### St. Louis Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer said Planned Parenthood's St. Louis clinic can continue providing abortions despite the Missouri health department's refusal to renew its license over a variety of patient safety concerns. He said the temporary restraining order was necessary to ""prevent irreparable injury"" to Planned Parenthood. ### With the abortion license set to expire at midnight Friday, Planned Parenthood pre-emptively sued this week and argued that the state was ""weaponizing"" the licensing process. Planned Parenthood said that absent court intervention, Missouri would become the first state without an abortion clinic since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide. ### The clinic's license will remain in effect until a ruling is issued on Planned Parenthood's request for a permanent injunction, Stelzer's ruling says. A hearing is set for Tuesday morning. ### ""Today is a victory for women across Missouri, but this fight is far from over,"" Planned Parenthood Federation of America CEO Dr. Leana Wen said in a statement. ""We have seen just how vulnerable access to abortion care is here -- and in the rest of the country."" ### Republican Gov. Mike Parson said in a written statement that state regulators still have ""serious health and safety concerns regarding Planned Parenthood's abortion facility in St. Louis."" ### Parson's administration drew support from Missouri Right to Life Executive Director Susan Klein, who backed a 2017 state law requiring unannounced annual inspections of abortion clinics. Klein said abortion-rights advocates are trying ""to play the victim and blame others for their deficiencies."" ### In refusing to renew the license, Missouri's health department cited ""failed surgical abortions in which women remained pregnant"" and legal violations, while insisting that it first needed to interview several clinic physicians who had been reluctant to talk. Planned Parenthood said two staff doctors agreed to interviews, but that others who are contractors or no longer work at the clinic would not talk. ### The fight over the clinic's license comes as lawmakers in many conservative states are passing new restrictions that take aim at Roe. Abortion opponents, emboldened by new conservative justices on the Supreme Court, are hoping federal courts will uphold laws that prohibit abortions before a fetus is viable outside the womb, the dividing line the high court set in Roe. ### Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio have enacted bills barring abortion once there's a detectable fetal heartbeat, as early as the sixth week of pregnancy. Parson signed a Missouri bill last week approving an eight-week ban on abortion, with exceptions only for medical emergencies. ### Alabama has gone even further, outlawing virtually all abortions, even in cases of rape or incest. None of the bans has taken effect, and all are expected to face legal challenges. ### Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Sarah Felts said the St. Louis clinic continued to perform abortions Friday, including on patients who moved up appointments that had been scheduled for next week. The clinic also provides other services that were not jeopardized by the license dispute. ### The number of abortions performed in Missouri has declined every year for the past decade, reaching a low of 2,910 last year. Of those, an estimated 1,210 occurred at eight weeks or less of pregnancy, according to preliminary statistics from the state health department. ### Missouri women also seek abortions in other states. In Kansas, about 3,300 of the 7,000 abortions performed in 2018 were for Missouri residents, according to the state's health department. Illinois does not track the home states of women seeking abortions. ### An abortion clinic is located just across the Mississippi River in Granite City, Illinois, less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the Planned Parenthood facility in St. Louis. Planned Parenthood's abortion clinic in the Kansas City area is in Overland Park, Kansas, just 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the state line. State figures show a handful of Missouri hospitals also perform abortions, but those are relatively rare. ### ------",60119,1,""" Today is a victory for women across Missouri, but this fight is far from over,"" Planned Parenthood Federation of America CEO Dr. Leana Wen said in a statement.

Maybe once, maybe many times. Either way, I find it incredible that so many moms come up with unique and innovative ideas for baby products. And then actually follow through and create a business. That's some serious work and planning in between diaper changes! The only fun product I created as a mom was a ring made out of play dough. ### If a product has been invented by a mom, it gets an extra seal of approval from me. Here are some of the best products out there invented by some kick-butt moms: ### Freemie Hands-Free Breast Pump ### Founded by a female doctor with newborn preemies, this is a hands-free breast pump that lets you walk around and do whatever you need to be doing as you're collecting breast milk. Only a mom could think up this brilliant idea! ### Aden + Anais ### Just about every mom I know has heard of this brand of wraps and blankets made from organic muslin. Mom Raegan Moya-Jones, who was raised in Australia where muslin wraps were common, introduced her first wrap in 2006, and her soft, lightweight products have been a hit with moms ever since. ### Belly Bandit ### When Lori Caden was struggling with her post-pregnancy weight, she and her sisters teamed up to create a post-pregnancy shapewear collection. The products are dedicated to making moms look and feel their best, because that is exactly what we need post-baby! ### Bare Baby Bottle ### Priska Diaz, originally from Peru, designed these bottles that feed babies air-free milk while in an upright position, allowing babies to control the flow and pace of feeding. The air-free bottles reduce issues with acid reflux and have nipples that extend to mimic breastfeeding. How brilliant is that? ### Simple Wishes Hands-Free Pumping Bra ### Invented by sisters and moms who wanted to help support women as they breastfeed, these are a collection of bras that help you nurse and pump. When nursing or pumping, these bras easily adjust and pull off the breast, which is extremely helpful. ### Baby Merlin Sleep Suit ### This suit saved us when our son graduated from the swaddle but was still flailing his hands when he slept and continually woke himself up. The suit, which was created by a mother of four, positions babies so their arms are gently weighted down — and it also helps them sleep longer. And babies sleeping longer is everything to a mama! ### Milk Stork ### Kate Torgersen needed to go away on a four-day business trip and still get her breastmilk to her babies, so she came up with the idea for the Milk Stork. It's a delivery service for busy, traveling moms who are also breastfeeding. ### Nanobebe ### Alright, this one was invented by a dad, but they count too! This bottle feeds breastmilk out of the bottle without killing its nutrients. The dad came up with the idea in the middle of the night when his son was hungry and he couldn't heat the breastmilk he had fast enough without damaging its properties. ### Tantrum Fix ### A mom of two created a portable kit when you're out and about to help you deal with tantrums in a respectful way. It includes things like a book to teach your child about emotions, a step-by-step plan method book for you, a time out bottle, a puzzle and bubbles. We all need this kit!",60119,1,"This suit saved us when our son graduated from the swaddle but was still flailing his hands when he slept and continually woke himself up.

Thursday night, which is filmed in California, the state she represents. ### She and host Jimmy Kimmel discussed the former special counsel Robert Mueller's recent public statement and the calls from many in her party to begin an impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump. ### She said the Republican-controlled Senate is ""completely in the pocket of Donald Trump"" and will continue to side with him, even if they know he committed a crime. ### Throughout the segment, Pelosi emphasized the need to be ""ready"" before pursuing impeachment and said she believes the president wants Democrats to impeach him. ### Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . ### House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made clear that she's fed up with discussing President Donald Trump during an interview with Jimmy Kimmel on his late-night talk show. ### ""Myself, I'm done with him in terms of talking about him,"" Pelosi said on Thursday, just one day after the former special counsel Robert Mueller delivered his first public, televised statement regarding his two-year investigation into Russian election interference. ### Mueller said if his team ""had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,"" adding that he was legally unable to charge the president with a crime because it's against Department of Justice policy. ### Read more: Mueller laid out 2 reasons for why he investigated Trump even though he knew he couldn't charge him. Both of them are bad news for the president. ### Mueller said during his statement that only Congress could ""formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" spurring Democratic lawmakers to intensify their calls for Pelosi to begin an impeachment investigation into Trump. ### Several 2020 candidates and prominent Democrats, including Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have vocalized their support for impeachment. ### Pelosi thinks Trump wants Democrats to impeach him ### But Pelosi continues to stand firm and resist impeachment efforts. ### She told Kimmel that she believes Trump wants Democrats to impeach him. ### ""He knows it's not a good idea to be impeached, but the silver lining for him is then he believes he would be exonerated by the United States Senate, and there's a school of thought that says if the Senate acquits you, why bring charges against him in the private sector when he's no longer president?"" Pelosi said. ""When we go through with our case, it's got to be ironclad."" ### She said the Republican-controlled Senate is ""completely in the pocket of Donald Trump"" and will continue to side with him, even if they know he committed a crime. ### The Trump vs. Pelosi feud escalates ### While Pelosi and Trump have clashed throughout his presidency, their feud has reached new heights as of late. ### Last Wednesday, Pelosi said the president is ""engaged in a cover-up,"" prompting Trump to call a last-minute press conference — after walking out of a meeting with Democrats over infrastructure policy — to lambaste Democratic leadership and hit back on Pelosi's remarks.

47094,"Sacramento’s tabletop gamers don’t just compete, they build community. ### Advertisement ### Aside from the people directly affected by the crimes, the audience that’s going to be most provoked by Jailbirds is Sacramento. ### The Netflix series, which premiered in May, is getting national buzz and customary “where are they now?” articles. It follows mostly female inmates at Sacramento County Main Jail and at the Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center, documenting their daily struggles and dreams of freedom. Through shots of the Tower Bridge, Cesar Chavez Plaza and other familiar places, the show constantly reminds us of what’s obvious and overlooked: that the women in these Orange Is the New Black, reality-TV moments are human, and they’re our neighbors. ### It starts at intake: Yasmin Sundermeyer is on $100,000 bail for an alleged carjacking. The 19-year-old is distraught and worried about missing work. She has a kid and wants to be a veterinarian. ### The first of six episodes introduces a cast of women who call the jail’s seventh floor home. There’s Megan “Monster” Hawkins, a former New York tattoo parlor owner and drug dealer who wants to turn her life around. There’s Rebecca Temme, or “Baby Girl”, who was facing a life sentence for murder, and trying to get out of isolation to join her half-sister in the jail. Court records show she was convicted on May 10. ### Many of the inmates, including Tayler Coatney, grapple with guilt. The 19-year-old was convicted of burglary in connection with a gruesome home invasion in South Sacramento that left three dead in 2016. ### The show offers some insight into jail life: the uncomfortable intake process where new inmates are forced to strip down and bend over in front of an officer; the confusing “jail math” used to calculate sentences; jargon such as “messy” and “out-of-pocket,” used to describe problematic inmates who are drama-happy and out of line. ### Mostly, Jailbirds dishes personal drama. Some of the women fall in love with male inmates on other floors, chatting through the toilet. If you empty all the water from the bowl, they explain, you’re able to communicate by yelling through the pipes, and even send notes and treats through a string-and-spoon process called “fishing.” To hang up, flush. ### Others argue and scuffle. An early conflict arises when an inmate named “Drea” snitches on Hawkins and her cellmate for cooking up “pruno,” an alcoholic drink made from fermented fruit. ### Coatney connects with an inmate who calls himself “A1.” He’s facing domestic violence charges for assaulting Hawkins, his ex. Two inmates get married in the jail’s basement, and several are freed by the end of the show. ### It’s tempting to say that the latter half of the season gets bogged down by too many petty conflicts. But it’s also another opportunity to empathize. While incarcerated, these women only have each other, and the drama is not unlike what you’d see on the outside. ### There are moments, particularly with Coatney, that will give you pause. If an accused accomplice to murder has her own Netflix series, what do the victims deserve? ### Jailbirds makes the most sense if everyone deserves to be humanized. Some of the most powerful scenes show the women in freedom—walking down I Street, hopeful and out of “oranges,” slang for jail clothes. ### Hawkins recently made headlines for returning to jail. She’s faces charges including for identity and vehicle theft. Like most characters in documentaries and reality TV—and most people who enter the criminal justice system—their stories don’t end when the credits roll.",60119,1,"Mostly, Jailbirds dishes personal drama.

57013,"Missouri's Last Abortion Provider Wins Reprieve, As Judge Rules Against State ### By Bobby Allyn ### NPR.org, May 31, 2019 · A Missouri judge has blocked the state's attempt to close down Missouri's last abortion provider. ### Missouri Circuit Court Judge Michael Stelzer granted a request to temporarily prevent state officials from revoking the license of a clinic operated by a St. Louis Planned Parenthood chapter, as the state's health department had sought to do. ### If the license is not renewed, Missouri will become the first state without a clinic providing abortions since the procedure became legal 46 years ago. ### Planned Parenthood, Stelzer wrote in his order, ""demonstrated that immediate and irreparable injury will result"" if Missouri refuses to renew the clinic's license. He added that the temporary restraining order ""is necessary to preserve the status quo and prevent irreparable injury."" ### Stelzer issued his ruling Friday, hours before a midnight deadline. The judge set a hearing on the matter for Tuesday. ### ""This is a victory for women across Missouri, but this fight is far from over. We have seen just how vulnerable access to abortion care is in Missouri — and in the rest of the country,"" said Leana Wen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood. ### Anti-abortion-rights groups were dismayed by the decision, echoing the governor's position that there are health and safety concerns at the clinic that need to be investigated. ### ""Planned Parenthood caused this artificial crisis when they ignored the law and refused to comply with the state of Missouri's very reasonable requests,"" said Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins, who called Stelzer's ruling an example of ""judicial activism in favor of abortion."" ### In a lawsuit seeking to keep the clinic open, Planned Parenthood had warned that closing the facility could force some women to ""turn to medically unsupervised and in some cases unsafe methods to terminate unwanted pregnancies."" ### Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, who recently signed one of the country's most restrictive abortion laws, has maintained that state officials need to complete an investigation into a patient complaint before the clinic's license is renewed. Missouri officials have not revealed details about that complaint. ### During a press conference earlier this week , Parson argued that the attempt to not renew the clinic's license is not political. ### ""This is not an issue about the pro-life issue at all. This is about a standard of care for women in the state of Missouri,"" Parson said. ""Whether it's this clinic or any other clinic or any other hospital, they should have to meet the same standards."" ### In March, state officials cited a number of deficiencies in their inspections of the clinic as part of the annual license renewal process. One problem they noted was that not all of the staff had participated in a fire drill. Then in April, Missouri officials announced an investigation of an unspecified complaint from a patient. ### State officials asked to interview seven physicians associated with the clinic, some of whom were employed by Washington University Medical School and were not part of the clinic's full-time staff. Because of that relationship, the clinic argues it cannot force the doctors to be interviewed. It also says the state has not revealed the scope of the questioning, which the clinic's legal team says could include criminal referrals. ### Legal wrangling ensued over the interviews, with the clinic saying it did everything in its power to make the sessions happen and state officials countering that the clinic was getting in the way of the interviews. ### Jamie Boyer, the attorney for Planned Parenthood, said in the suit that Missouri ""is simply wrong in insisting it is entitled to refuse to act on Planned Parenthood's application for license renewal."" ### But Parson says that because of the audit and investigators' inability to complete the investigation into the patient complaint, the clinic's license cannot be renewed. ### Ahead of the ruling, clinics in states surrounding Missouri, meanwhile, told NPR that there were real worries about a wave of patients traveling across state lines from Missouri. It would be a natural response, they said, to the looming prospect of abortions being inaccessible to patients statewide. ### ""Missouri is already in what's considered an abortion desert where the majority of Missourians live over 100 miles from a clinic,"" Michele Landeau, board president of the Gateway Women's Access Fund, told NPR member station St. Louis Public Radio. The fund helps women pay for abortions. ### ""Closing clinics is just going to make that distance even worse,"" she said. ### Supporters of the St. Louis clinic praised the judge's ruling but said the struggle for access to abortions in Missouri continues. ### ""While temporary, we celebrate today, and tomorrow, we go back to work to ensure access to abortion does not go dark at the last health center that provides abortion in Missouri,"" said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an abortion provider at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region. ""While Gov. Parson abandoned our patients, we will not."" ### NPR's Sarah McCammon contributed to this report.",60119,1,""" While temporary, we celebrate today, and tomorrow, we go back to work to ensure access to abortion does not go dark at the last health center that provides abortion in Missouri,"" said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an abortion provider at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region.

Picture: Takashi Aoyama/Getty Images ### “There’s plenty for us to look at -- obviously in controlling the game a bit better. We got a bit loose and put ourselves under a little bit of pressure so we will learn from it.” ### The Brumbies were jolted at the start when Hosea Saumaki burst clear to put the Sunwolves ahead in the first minute of their final home game of the season. ### But the visitors quickly hit back through Peter Samu and Irae Simone, before Thomas Banks ran in a highlight try after a deft kick from Lealiifano had triggered panic in the Sunwolves ranks. ### media_camera ### Brumbies' Tom Banks on the burst against the Sunwolves.

But we struggled around the scrums and with penalties. Credit to the Brumbies -- they’re a really good side and they put us under pressure.” ### BRUMBIES 42 (Connal McInerney 3, Tom Banks, Peter Samu, Irae Simone tries Christian Leali’ifano 6 cons) bt SUNWOLVES 19 (Jamie Booth, Semisi Masirewa, Hosea Saumaki tries Hayden Parker 2 cons) at Prince Chichibu Memorial Stadium.

The league did not specifically say what comments were determined to be fine-worthy, other than saying it was in response to what Rivers — the Clippers' coach — said about Leonard ""in a recent television appearance."" ### Rivers appeared on an NBA Finals preview show on ESPN earlier in the week and compared Leonard to Michael Jordan. The NBA has regularly warned teams about the perils of saying anything that could be construed as lobbying for a player who is under contract to one team to join another. ### ""I would just say Doc has been at this a long time,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Friday at an NBA Cares event in Toronto, not long after the fine was announced. ""It's not a fun part of my job ever fining anyone. And I understand the competing interest of the media in hearing a coach's view about a current NBA player but it's something where there's a bright line in this league and you're not allowed to do it."" ### Leonard will be a free agent this summer, and the Clippers are expected to be the teams who will try to pursue him. ### Rivers was part of a panel with Magic Johnson and others discussing Leonard's game when he made the Jordan comparison. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### ""He is the most like Jordan that we've seen,"" Rivers said on the telecast. ""Like, there's a lot of great players. LeBron (James) is phenomenal. KD (Kevin Durant) is phenomenal. But not that he is Jordan or anything like that, but he is the most like him. Big hands. Post game. Can finish. Great leaper. Great defender. In-between game. If you beat him to the spot, bumps you off. Then you add his 3-point shooting. ### ""So, I never get in that 'who's the best player?'"" Rivers continued. ""Magic is the best player, Michael Jordan was the best player, LeBron. But it's that same group."" ### Silver said NBA coaches or executives, when put in those situations, should simply say something akin to ""I'm not permitted by the league to respond to that question."" ### ""It's a balance of interest.

Cleary | The Herald Bulletin ### ANDERSON — The son of a Muncie man said he is frustrated by the federal investigation into his father’s plane accident. ### Spencer Jackson, 69, of Muncie, remains hospitalized following the accident on May 5. ### He was flying a Piper PA-34 Seneca that crashed shortly after takeoff at the Anderson Municipal Airport, according to a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board. ### Evan Jackson said his father has been a pilot for more than 41 years and logged thousands of hours of flight. ### “You would think they would want to know exactly what happened,” said Evan Jackson. “A 40-year pilot doesn’t wreck a plane on takeoff.” ### The airplane was registered to and operated by SPC Leasing, LLC of Daleville. The registered agent’s name for the Domestic Limited Liability Company is Laura Gruwell. No other information regarding the company’s members is listed on the INBiz website. ### Witnesses reported seeing the airplane rock back and forth during its initial climb, according to the NTSB. The left wing dropped, the airplane descended, and impacted the ground with the left wing first. ### Video surveillance at the airport captured the airplane’s departure, but authorities denied a request by The Herald Bulletin to see the video. ### “A review of the video revealed the airplane's wings rocked slightly before it disappeared out of view,” the preliminary report by the NTSB states. “When the airplane reappeared in the camera's view, the airplane was descending with the left wing low. ### “The airplane impacted terrain and came to rest facing the opposite direction of travel.” ### The cockpit area and cabin of the aircraft was “largely destroyed” by the impact, according to the report. ### Evan Jackson said there are ways to test equipment on the airplane that would provide key information about the crash, but he said those tests have not been performed. ### “The whole situation is unfortunate and we are just trying to get through it the best we can,” he said. ### Follow Traci L.  ### Tags",60119,1,"May 31, 2019###The Piper Seneca PA 34, which crashed May 5 at Anderson Municipal Airport, is owned by SPC Leasing.###John P.

The player's father calls the incident ""a setup"" against his son. ### The document obtained by The Associated Press on Saturday says the incident took place May 15 at 8:20 p.m. in a hotel. The woman went to police on Friday in Sao Paulo. ### Sao Paulo state's Public Security Secretariat, which oversees police, confirmed in a statement that the complaint was registered, but did not offer details. ### Neymar's representatives have not replied to a request for comment, but his father and agent Neymar da Silva Santos denied any wrongdoing by the player in a television interview. ### Santos said Neymar had consensual sexual relations with the accuser and was blackmailed by her lawyer after they broke up. ### ""This is a tough moment. If we can't show the truth quickly it will be a snowball. If we have to show Neymar's WhatsApp messages and the conversations with this lady, we will,"" Santos told TV Band. ### Neymar's father said he has evidence that his son was blackmailed, including pictures and witnesses, but did not show either in the interview. He also said his son is already preparing his defense for a legal case if needed. ### The Paris police and the city's prosecutors' office said through spokesmen that they were unaware of any complaint. ### The woman says she and the Brazil star met in France after exchanging Instagram messages. ### She told police a representative of the Paris Saint-Germain player named Gallo allegedly bought her tickets to Paris and booked her a hotel room. She said Neymar arrived apparently drunk at the hotel. ### The woman described to police that they ""touched each other, but in a given moment Neymar became aggressive and, with violence, had sexual intercourse against the victim's will."" ### The text also says the woman left Paris two days later and said she did not file her complaint in Paris because she was shaken. ### The police document says the woman will go through medical exams as part of an investigation. ### Neymar is in Brazil preparing for the Copa America starting next week. He arrived at the Granja Comary training ground outside Rio de Janeiro 10 days after the alleged incident. ### Brazil players had a day off Saturday. Neymar left the training ground with other teammates in his helicopter earlier in the day. ### On Sunday, an event named after the player is expected to take place in Rio, but his presence is not assured. ### The 27-year-old Brazilian has had problems on and off the pitch. One week before the accusation of rape became known, he lost Brazil's national team's captaincy for the Copa America to veteran Dani Alves. Coach Tite did not lay out the reasons for the move, but he was under pressure to punish Neymar for his disciplinary problems at Paris Saint-Germain. ### After PSG lost the French Cup final to tiny Rennes on April 27, Neymar had altercation with a fan and publicly criticized teammates he didn't name for not listening to him enough. ### That was one of his first matches since January, when he once more picked up a fifth metatarsal injury in his right-foot. That was the same problem that affected his performances in the last World Cup, a tournament he prefers to forget because of an image disaster caused by his constant diving. ### Brazil's fitness coaches say he will be in better shape once the South American tournament begins. ### This week Neymar skipped two Brazil training sessions in Copa America preparations because of pains in his left knee. Brazil's soccer confederation said Friday he was fully recovered. ### Fan love for the player has also been stained because of politics after his showing of support to far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has made a series of racist, misogynistic and anti-gay statements. ### As Neymar prepared for his return after the injury, Brazilian media reported his father had met Bolsonaro and Economy Minister Paulo Guedes to discuss the player's tax problems, which didn't help him with fans that will pressure him more than ever to win a Copa America on home soil later this month. ### ___ ### AP Sports Writer John Leicester in Paris contributed to this report. ### ___",60119,1,"Image 1 of 1###Brazil's soccer player Neymar runs for the ball during a practice session at the Granja Comary training center ahead of the Copa America tournament, in Teresopolis, Brazil, Tuesday, May 28, 2019.###Brazil's soccer player Neymar runs for the ball during a practice session at the Granja Comary training center ahead of the Copa America tournament, in Teresopolis, Brazil, Tuesday, May 28, 2019.###Photo: Leo Correa, AP###Woman accuses Neymar of rape, father says player set up","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]","<p>Image 1 of 1</p><p>Brazil's soccer player Neymar runs for the ball during a practice session at the Granja Comary training center ahead of the Copa America tournament, in Teresopolis, Brazil, Tuesday, May 28, 2019.</p><p>Brazil's soccer player Neymar runs for the ball during a practice session at the Granja Comary training center ahead of the Copa America tournament, in Teresopolis, Brazil, Tuesday, May 28, 2019.</p><p>Photo: Leo Correa, AP</p><p>Woman accuses Neymar of rape, father says player set up</p>",876

Andres Kudacki, File AP Photo ### NEW YORK ### If it's Pride Month, there's gotta be a parade. And there will be, in New York City and places around the country and world. ### But this year, the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising that fueled the fire for a global LGBTQ movement, there's also a lot more. From symposiums to movie screenings, walking tours to art exhibits, and even an opera, a slew of institutions and organizations are filling June with events that commemorate that moment and its impact through the past five decades, and also using it as inspiration for the current generation of activists to keep pushing for civil rights. ### The uproar at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City's West Village, began on June 28, 1969, when bar patrons and area residents, tired of harassment that was still allowed by law, clashed with police officers who had come to raid the nightspot. Demonstrations continued for the next several nights. ### Those events weren't the first resistance act of the gay rights movement, but it galvanized activism in the United States and around the world. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to The Sacramento Bee content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### That history is all over the events that a wide range of institutions are hosting in June, from an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum called ""Nobody Promised You Tomorrow: Art 50 Years After Stonewall"" to an opera by British composer Iain Bell commissioned by the New York City Opera called ""Stonewall,"" which is getting its world premiere toward the end of the month. ### There are walking tours, like the one from the New York City LGBT Historic Sites Project that will take participants around Greenwich Village and talk about the anti-gay climate that led to the Stonewall protests, and a panel discussion at a branch of the New York Public Library from transgender speakers talking about Stonewall and current trans life. ### ""In the best possible world we would use these anniversaries, and I think it's happening this time, as a jumping-off point to look deeper,"" said Eric Marcus, founder of the Stonewall 50 Consortium, an organization that brought together cultural institutions and others primarily in New York City that have created programming connected to Stonewall. ### It's not just New York City, as Pride festivals and parades are taking place around the country in June and beyond, and references to the Stonewall anniversary are everywhere. ### In Raleigh, North Carolina, a month of events will include a ball celebrating those who resisted at Stonewall. At the Library of Congress in Washington, a display that went up at the end of May called ""Stonewall at 50 — LGBTQ+ Activism in the United States"" uses flyers and other historical items to showcase protest history. ### But for New York City, the anniversary has become the opportunity to take its already high-profile Pride celebrations even higher; Heritage of Pride, the organization that plans the city's parade and other events, has included a commemorative rally in its slate of events for the month, and is hosting WorldPride as well, the first time the international event has been held in the United States in its two-decade existence. ### The confluence of all that has Pride organizers and city tourism officials hopeful that the throngs of visitors who come to take part in the various Pride activities over a period of about six weeks could double. ### Fred Dixon, president and CEO of NYC & Company, the city's marketing organization, said the city's cultural institutions really responded to the anniversary. ### ""We're proud of how many came forward and put together great programming,"" he said. ### The spirit of protest that Stonewall represents is also represented in some events this month, including the Queer Liberation March being planned by the Reclaim Pride Coalition. ### That group decries what it sees as the commercialization and corporatization of mainstream Pride events. The coalition's march is planned for the same day as the main Heritage of Pride march June 30. ### ""There are members of our community who have always struggled, who have always been left behind,"" said Natalie James, co-founder of Reclaim Pride. ""What I think we want to go back to is ... the radicalism and solidarity of the early days of the activists in this movement.""",60119,1,"In Raleigh, North Carolina, a month of events will include a ball celebrating those who resisted at Stonewall.

The rapper was purportedly caught on camera tossing an ice bucket at the women as well. ### She ultimately surrendered to police and was charged with misdemeanor assault and reckless endangerment. ### With a grand jury, Cardi's misdemeanor counts of assault and reckless endangerment could be upgraded to stiffer charges. ### READ MORE: Cardi B Gives Nude Anatomy Lesson Amid Backlash Over NSFW Music Awards Photo ### In April, she reportedly rejected a plea deal because her attorneys insisted that she had not harmed anyone during the alleged altercation.

The American actress also said she might move to Canada if Trump was elected president. Instead, two years on, she married Britain's Prince Harry and became part of the royal family. ### Suggesting that he had been unaware of the duchess's 2016 remarks ahead of preparations for his upcoming state visit to Britain and his royal reception on Monday, Trump said in an audio recording released by the Sun: ""I didn't know that she was nasty."" ### Trump had previously used the word to describe his Democratic opponent during the 2016 campaign, calling Hillary Clinton a ""nasty woman"" - words that later became a rallying cry for the anti-Trump movement. ### But this time, Trump refrained from provoking a full-blown spat, quickly emphasizing in the same interview with the Sun that ""I am sure she will do excellently"" as a duchess. ### Trump's remarks ahead of the trip echoed concerns voiced in the lead-up to Meghan's wedding with Harry: that her past political activism may make things awkward for the royal family, which is not supposed to voice public political views. She started to speak out against sexism as a child and never hid her other personal convictions throughout her acting career, including thoughts on U.S. politics. As member of the British royal family, Meghan has already strayed further into political territory than others, for instance by speaking out against racism, which she herself has faced in recent months. ### While her past comments are a nightmare for those knowing the ins and outs of royal protocol, the British public may have a different take. ""You know, we don't care what he thinks about us,"" British lawyer and political activist Shola Mos-Shogbamimu told Sky News on Saturday. ""Women are going to stand up together and speak out against the lunacy of his presidency,"" she said of Trump. ### Related Stories ### Laura Ingraham promoted a white supremacist on her show. At least one advertiser is pulling out. ### The president has faced major resistance in Europe in the past, and a ""Trump Baby"" balloon greeted the president when he visited Britain last July during a four-day working visit, to the cheers of bystanders. ### Trump's state visit, which begins Monday, has been repeatedly delayed. He was originally invited shortly after taking office in 2017. Trump also plans to attend ceremonies commemorating the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings while visiting Britain and France. ### Meghan, who is still on maternity leave, and Trump will not meet during the president's visit to Britain. Harry is expected to attend, according to British media. ### As a biracial and divorced American, Meghan's biography has vastly differed from the life experiences that have so far dominated the halls of Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. Opening up traditions and acknowledging that even royals can have opinions, her supporters said, has infused royal traditions with a more human and natural touch. ### When Harry and Meghan launched their Instagram account in early April, the handle immediately broke records, reaching 1 million followers within less than 6 hours. Many of the couple's fans are from the United States, where almost 30 million watched their wedding last year, compared to about 23 million who watched Kate Middleton wed Prince William back in 2011. The birth of Harry and Meghan's first baby, Archie, was celebrated by fans around the globe this May. ### Meghan's popularity in the United States could prove to be an opportunity for a royal family, as evidence that the expensive traditions remain a cornerstone of British influence abroad. But it could also become a pitfall, given that not everyone across the Atlantic agrees with her political views.",60119,1,"Suggesting that he had been unaware of the duchess's 2016 remarks ahead of preparations for his upcoming state visit to Britain and his royal reception on Monday, Trump said in an audio recording released by the Sun: ""I didn't know that she was nasty.

She also asked that it be a fruit tree that requires no spraying. ### I didn’t think twice before offering a suggestion. “Serviceberry!” I enthusiastically responded. ### If the sweet lady took my advice, she can look forward to years of delicious berries and lovely fall foliage. ### Autumn Brilliance Serviceberry (Amelanchier x grandflora) is a beloved hybrid cultivar growing in the Linnaeus Teaching Garden in Woodward Park. I first encountered this small flowering tree years ago while visiting the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis. I was at the botanical garden (arguably one of the finest botanical garden in the nation) to spend time with an old friend and fellow horticulturist. It was a beautiful June day. As we passed a lovely, multistemmed small tree loaded with bright red and blue berries, my friend paused and pulled a handful of berries from a low hanging branch. He tossed half the berries into his mouth and offered the rest to me. ### My first thought was to wait a few minutes to see if my friend keeled over with food poisoning before tossing the berries into my mouth. While pondered that thought, my buddy eagerly collected and devoured another handful of berries. A look of pure pleasure spread across his face. Cautiously, I followed suit and immediately became a big fan of Serviceberry. ### When asked to describe the flavor of Serviceberries, I generally respond by saying that the pretty little berries taste somewhat like a cross between wild cherry and blueberry. Serviceberry isn’t related to either, however. It has its own unique taste, better some would argue, than that of cherry or blueberry. ### Flavor alone is reason enough to grow Serviceberry. However, there are other valid reasons to include this native species in your garden. In early April, it smothers its slender, gray branches with a cloud of tiny, sparkling white flowers. In June, its graceful branches load up with edible, ripe fruit. Serviceberry is the first of all the tree fruits to ripen in June and is, therefore, often referred to as “Juneberry.” ### Serviceberry has still other garden attributes. In late October, its lovely green foliage turns brilliant shades of red and orange, hence the cultivar name “Autumn Brilliance.” Even after shedding all of its fall foliage, this graceful, multistem small tree displays a lovely vase-shaped branch structure in the winter garden. In short, what’s not to like about Serviceberry? ### Autumn Brilliance is just one of several outstanding Serviceberry cultivars offered by the nursery industry. It’s a favorite of mine because of its toughness relative to our challenging Oklahoma weather. Also, its sweet berries make to-die-for pies! ### Autumn Brilliance reaches a height of approximately 12 to 15 feet. Plant in full sun or partial shade. Heavy fruiting typically begins the second or third year after planting. Birds adore Serviceberries. Purchase bird netting when fruiting begins. Otherwise, there will be no Serviceberry pies to be had at your house. ### Barry Fugatt is director of horticulture at the Linnaeus Teaching Garden and Tulsa Garden Center in Woodward Park.

(YouTube) ### Listen to the full episode27:28 ### One episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show was considered to be so morbid that a brand new director had to be brought in to handle it tastefully. And boy did it pay off. ### This week, it's our annual Bookmarks episode - where we tell fascinating stories from our research that didn't make it into the regular season. Like - the shocking reason Beatles producer George Martin first met the Fab Four. Why an episode of Mary Tyler Moore was considered to be so morbid that a brand new director had to be brought in to handle it tastefully. And why there were blank spaces in Bill Murray's original Caddyshack script. Hope you'll join us. 0:57 ### The Mary Tyler Moore Show won 29 Primetime Emmys, including Outstanding Comedy Series three years in a row. So many great episodes, but people often cite one specific episode as their favourite of all time. ### It was titled ""Chuckles Bites The Dust."" ### That episode was about the funeral of Chuckles the Clown, a recurring character on the show who hosted a children's program on the fictional WJM TV station. ### In the script, Chuckles' death is caused by an overzealous parade elephant that mistook the clown, who was dressed as a peanut, for a real snack. ### The subject matter worried CBS. The network feared it was too morbid for a sitcom. ### Almost all of the show's episodes had been directed by Jay Sandrich. But - he declined to direct the Chuckles script. ### It became difficult to find someone to take the reins on the episode. That's when the job was given to a female director named Joan Darling. ### She was thrilled to get the job - not just because she needed the paycheck - but because she was happy for every chance she got to prove women could direct. ### The episode script was highly unusual. ### During rehearsals, the crew members didn't laugh at all. The reaction of the crew was usually a reliable indicator of how a show would play. That made everyone nervous. ### But when it came time to tape the show before a live audience, the crowd laughed hysterically. As a matter of fact, the audience laughed so much the laugh time added 10 minutes to the show's length. ### And most of that laughter came during the funeral scene. ### In that scene, Lou and Murray start to make jokes about how Chuckles died. Mary is appalled and gives them stern looks. ### But then during the minister's eulogy, Mary starts to giggle uncontrollably over and over again. ### Then when the minister tells Mary it's okay to laugh, because Chuckles loved to make people laugh, Mary starts to sob uncontrollably. ### TV critics raved about the show. The episode gave director Joan Darling her first Emmy nomination. Her reputation as a director got such a boost she started receiving film scripts from major studios. ### The Chuckles episode would show up on virtually every future list of ""greatest episodes of all time"" - usually at the top. ### It goes to show that nine times out of ten, if you put risky material in the right hands, odds are it's going to turn out alright. ### If the material is in experienced hands, if you impress the best against an idea with potential - chances are it's going to be really, really memorable. ### Maybe even brilliant. ### For more stories about Iconic Brands, click or tap the ""Listen"" tab above to hear the full Under the Influence episode.

That should include materiel that will gather information to help astronauts later on to land, navigate and protect themselves from radiation. ### Orbit Beyond will land in Mare Imbrium, a lava plain in a lunar crater, by September 2020, after being launched by one of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets. ### Intuitive Machines will try to land by July 2021 in Oceanous Procellarum, a dark spot on the Moon visible from Earth. SpaceX will also facilitate that launch. ### Astrobotic, which is based in Pittsburgh, will target Lacus Mortis, a large crater on the near side of the Moon, by July 2021. It has yet to choose a delivery rocket. ### NASA awarded the companies USD 77-97 million each for development of their landers. ### ""Next year, our initial science and technology research will be on the lunar surface, which will help support sending the first woman and the next man to the Moon in five years,"" said NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine on Friday. ### ""Investing in these commercial landing services also is another strong step to build a commercial space economy beyond low-Earth orbit.""

10563,"Netflix’s ‘When They See Us’ Tells the Story of the Central Park Five. Here’s a Timeline of the Real Events. ### Gabrielle Bruney ### From Esquire ### In late 1980s, a brutal crime shook New York City. Trisha Meili, a white banker who would become known in the press as the Central Park Jogger , was raped and beaten almost to death during an evening run in the city’s most beloved park. Five black and Latino teenagers, boys aged 14 to 16, were convicted of the horrifying assault, and would serve between six and 13 years in prison for the crime before the real perpetrator was found. The case is the basis for Ava DuVernay’s upcoming Netflix miniseries, When They See Us, which debuts May 31st. Here’s a timeline of the decades-long saga. ### April 17, 1989 ### A 26-year-old woman was beaten and raped in northern Central Park by a man she described as having stitches on his chin . After her attack, a detective consulted local hospitals for young men fitting her description, and was given the name of Matias Reyes, an 18-year-old who worked at a bodega near the scene of the attack. Authorities never followed up on this lead. ### April 19, 1989 ### Around 9 pm, a group of about 30 teenage boys entered Central Park from 110th Street and 5th Avenue. Taking a southeast route, some of the boys intimidated and assaulted passersby. They threw rocks and sticks, and others beat a male jogger so badly that he had to be hospitalized for two days. ### Around the same time, 28-year-old Trisha Meili entered the park from 84th Street and 5th Avenue for her regular after-work jog, running a path that took her northwest. While running a path known as the 102nd Street Cross Drive , she was hit in the back of the head with a tree branch, dragged off the path, and raped and beaten in an isolated section of the park. She wouldn’t be discovered for hours. ### In response to the muggings and harassment by the group of teen, police apprehended five boys, including Kevin Richardson and Raymond Santana, and brought them to the Central Park Precinct. ### Photo credit: New York Daily News Archive - Getty Images ### More ### April 20, 1989 ### At around 1:30 am, passersby discovered Meili in the park. The young woman was near death, having lost up to 80 percent of her blood . Police instantly connected the attack on Meili to the other, less serious crimes, that occurred in the park that night. By 11 pm, investigators brought more boys who were in the park that night to the station, including Antron McCray, Korey Wise, and Yusef Salaam. ### Wise, who suffered from hearing loss and a learning disability, was 16 years old, and could therefore be legally interrogated without a guardian present. The other boys were 14 and 15. But after hours of interrogative pressure from some of the city’s top homicide detectives, Wise, McCray, Richardson, and Santana gave signed and videotaped statements confessing to being involved in the attack on Meili. Salaam wrote a confession but refused to sign it, and was implicated by other members of the group. The boys soon recanted, and all five of them reported that the police had promised they could go home if they produced the confessions. ### April 27 and 28, 1989 ### The boys were indicted on counts including attempted murder, rape, assault, and rioting. Charged as an adult, Wise was sent to New York’s notorious Rikers Island prison, while the others were taken to juvenile facilities. ### Photo credit: New York Post Archives - Getty Images ### More ### May 10, 1989 ### After days in a coma, Meili began to regain consciousness. But due to the severity of the brain trauma she suffered, she would never be able to remember the night of her attack. ### Donald Trump, then a local real estate developer and the best-selling author of The Art of the Deal, paid $85,000 to take out full-page ads in all of New York’s major papers. The ads implicitly responded to Meili’s rape and the teens’ apprehension with a call to bring back the death penalty. ### June 14, 1989 ### Matias Reyes forced his way into the 97th Street apartment of Lourdes Gonzalez , who was pregnant and home alone with her three small children. He raped and murdered her while her children listened from another room. ### June 5, 1989 ### Reyes forced his way into another woman’s apartment, also on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. After raping her, he was caught by her doorman and a neighbor. DNA evidence linked him to other rapes, including Gonzalez’s murder. Reyes would go onto plead guilty and be sentenced to 33 years to life. He’d attacked five women since April 19th. ### Photo credit: New York Daily News Archive - Getty Images ### More ### August 18, 1990 ### After a six week-long trial, McCray, Salaam, and Santana were convicted of the attack on Meili, despite numerous inconsistencies between their initial confessions and the facts of the case. None of the Five, save Wise, who was brought to the crime scene by investigators, were able to properly pinpoint the location in the park where Meili was attacked. They were also wrong about the time of the attack, and incorrectly described what she was wearing. Most strikingly, none of their DNA matched a sample taken from Melli’s rape kit. Still, they were sentenced to five to 10 years imprisonment, the maximum penalty given their juvenile status. ### December 11, 1990 ### Korey Wise and Kevin Richardson were convicted. Richardson was sentenced to five to 10 years, while Korey, charged as an adult, was sentenced to five to 15 years. ### June 12, 2002 ### The New York Times reported that known rapist, a now-31-year-old Matias Reyes, confessed to the Central Park Jogger attack . Reyes had encountered Wise, then the final member of the Five still incarcerated, in Auburn Prison in late 2001. (The two had met once before, and had gotten into an argument over the television in Rikers in 1989.) Their friendly second conversation left Reyes feeling guilty for the fact that Wise was in prison for a crime Reyes had committed. He confessed that he’d raped Meili, and that, as in all of his other attacks, he’d acted alone. ### Photo credit: Getty Images - Getty Images ### More ### December 19, 2002 ### After a DA’s office investigation matched Reyes’ DNA to the semen from Melli’s rape kit, and Reyes gave a detailed confession that, unlike the Central Park Five’s, closely hewed to known facts of the case, a judge overturned the Five’s convictions . By this time, Wise had been released and the only member of the Five imprisoned was Raymond Santana, who was incarcerated on unrelated drug charges. He was freed soon after, as his lengthy sentence was predicated on his status as a repeat offender. With his initial conviction overturned, Santana was re-sentenced as a first-time offender and released with time served. ### April 8, 2003 ### Trisha Meili, whose name had largely been withheld by the press as is customary for sexual assault victims, came forward with her identity in a memoir about her recovery , I Am the Central Park Jogger. ### January 27, 2003 ### The New York City Police Department completed an internal review of its management of the Central Park Jogger case. The department found no wrongdoing on the part of its officers, and despite the plethora of new evidence and vacated convictions, maintained that the Central Park Five were likely guilty. ### June 19, 2014 ### After a more than decade-long legal battle, New York City settled a civil rights lawsuit brought by the Central Park Five for $40 million dollars . ### Photo credit: Bryan Bedder - Getty Images ### More",60119,1,"April 20, 1989###At around 1:30 am, passersby discovered Meili in the park.

Maybe once, maybe many times. Either way, I find it incredible that so many moms come up with unique and innovative ideas for baby products. And then actually follow through and create a business. That's some serious work and planning in between diaper changes! The only fun product I created as a mom was a ring made out of play dough. ### If a product has been invented by a mom, it gets an extra seal of approval from me. Here are some of the best products out there invented by some kick-butt moms: ### Freemie Hands-Free Breast Pump ### Founded by a female doctor with newborn preemies, this is a hands-free breast pump that lets you walk around and do whatever you need to be doing as you're collecting breast milk. Only a mom could think up this brilliant idea! ### Aden + Anais ### Just about every mom I know has heard of this brand of wraps and blankets made from organic muslin. Mom Raegan Moya-Jones, who was raised in Australia where muslin wraps were common, introduced her first wrap in 2006, and her soft, lightweight products have been a hit with moms ever since. ### Belly Bandit ### When Lori Caden was struggling with her post-pregnancy weight, she and her sisters teamed up to create a post-pregnancy shapewear collection. The products are dedicated to making moms look and feel their best, because that is exactly what we need post-baby! ### Bare Baby Bottle ### Priska Diaz, originally from Peru, designed these bottles that feed babies air-free milk while in an upright position, allowing babies to control the flow and pace of feeding. The air-free bottles reduce issues with acid reflux and have nipples that extend to mimic breastfeeding. How brilliant is that? ### Simple Wishes Hands-Free Pumping Bra ### Invented by sisters and moms who wanted to help support women as they breastfeed, these are a collection of bras that help you nurse and pump. When nursing or pumping, these bras easily adjust and pull off the breast, which is extremely helpful. ### Baby Merlin Sleep Suit ### This suit saved us when our son graduated from the swaddle but was still flailing his hands when he slept and continually woke himself up. The suit, which was created by a mother of four, positions babies so their arms are gently weighted down — and it also helps them sleep longer. And babies sleeping longer is everything to a mama! ### Milk Stork ### Kate Torgersen needed to go away on a four-day business trip and still get her breastmilk to her babies, so she came up with the idea for the Milk Stork. It's a delivery service for busy, traveling moms who are also breastfeeding. ### Nanobebe ### Alright, this one was invented by a dad, but they count too! This bottle feeds breastmilk out of the bottle without killing its nutrients. The dad came up with the idea in the middle of the night when his son was hungry and he couldn't heat the breastmilk he had fast enough without damaging its properties. ### Tantrum Fix ### A mom of two created a portable kit when you're out and about to help you deal with tantrums in a respectful way. It includes things like a book to teach your child about emotions, a step-by-step plan method book for you, a time out bottle, a puzzle and bubbles.

96938,"Exhibits, panels, opera, more for Stonewall 50th anniversary ###  ### Deepti Hajela, The Associated Press ### Saturday ### Jun 1, 2019 at 9:01 AM Jun 1, 2019 at 4:30 PM ### NEW YORK (AP) "" If it's Pride Month, there's gotta be a parade. And there will be, in New York City and places around the country and world. ### But this year, the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising that fueled the fire for a global LGBTQ movement, there's also a lot more. From symposiums to movie screenings, walking tours to art exhibits, and even an opera, a slew of institutions and organizations are filling June with events that commemorate that moment and its impact through the past five decades, and also using it as inspiration for the current generation of activists to keep pushing for civil rights. ### The uproar at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City's West Village, began on June 28, 1969, when bar patrons and area residents, tired of harassment that was still allowed by law, clashed with police officers who had come to raid the nightspot. Demonstrations continued for the next several nights. ### Those events weren't the first resistance act of the gay rights movement, but it galvanized activism in the United States and around the world. ### That history is all over the events that a wide range of institutions are hosting in June, from an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum called ""Nobody Promised You Tomorrow: Art 50 Years After Stonewall"" to an opera by British composer Iain Bell commissioned by the New York City Opera called ""Stonewall,"" which is getting its world premiere toward the end of the month. ### There are walking tours, like the one from the New York City LGBT Historic Sites Project that will take participants around Greenwich Village and talk about the anti-gay climate that led to the Stonewall protests, and a panel discussion at a branch of the New York Public Library from transgender speakers talking about Stonewall and current trans life. ### ""In the best possible world we would use these anniversaries, and I think it's happening this time, as a jumping-off point to look deeper,"" said Eric Marcus, founder of the Stonewall 50 Consortium, an organization that brought together cultural institutions and others primarily in New York City that have created programming connected to Stonewall. ### It's not just New York City, as Pride festivals and parades are taking place around the country in June and beyond, and references to the Stonewall anniversary are everywhere. ### In Raleigh, North Carolina, a month of events will include a ball celebrating those who resisted at Stonewall. At the Library of Congress in Washington, a display that went up at the end of May called ""Stonewall at 50 "" LGBTQ+ Activism in the United States"" uses flyers and other historical items to showcase protest history. ### But for New York City, the anniversary has become the opportunity to take its already high-profile Pride celebrations even higher; Heritage of Pride, the organization that plans the city's parade and other events, has included a commemorative rally in its slate of events for the month, and is hosting WorldPride as well, the first time the international event has been held in the United States in its two-decade existence. ### The confluence of all that has Pride organizers and city tourism officials hopeful that the throngs of visitors who come to take part in the various Pride activities over a period of about six weeks could double. ### Fred Dixon, president and CEO of NYC & Company, the city's marketing organization, said the city's cultural institutions really responded to the anniversary. ### ""We're proud of how many came forward and put together great programming,"" he said. ### The spirit of protest that Stonewall represents is also represented in some events this month, including the Queer Liberation March being planned by the Reclaim Pride Coalition. ### That group decries what it sees as the commercialization and corporatization of mainstream Pride events. The coalition's march is planned for the same day as the main Heritage of Pride march June 30. ### ""There are members of our community who have always struggled, who have always been left behind,"" said Natalie James, co-founder of Reclaim Pride. ""What I think we want to go back to is ... the radicalism and solidarity of the early days of the activists in this movement."" ### Never miss a story ### Choose the plan that's right for you. ### Digital access or digital and print delivery.",60119,1,"But for New York City, the anniversary has become the opportunity to take its already high-profile Pride celebrations even higher; Heritage of Pride, the organization that plans the city's parade and other events, has included a commemorative rally in its slate of events for the month, and is hosting WorldPride as well, the first time the international event has been held in the United States in its two-decade existence.###The confluence of all that has Pride organizers and city tourism officials hopeful that the throngs of visitors who come to take part in the various Pride activities over a period of about six weeks could double.###Fred Dixon, president and CEO of NYC & Company, the city's marketing organization, said the city's cultural institutions really responded to the anniversary.###"" We're proud of how many came forward and put together great programming,"" he said.###The spirit of protest that Stonewall represents is also represented in some events this month, including the Queer Liberation March being planned by the Reclaim Pride Coalition.","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]","<p>But for New York City, the anniversary has become the opportunity to take its already high-profile Pride celebrations even higher; Heritage of Pride, the organization that plans the city's parade and other events, has included a commemorative rally in its slate of events for the month, and is hosting WorldPride as well, the first time the international event has been held in the United States in its two-decade existence.</p><p>The confluence of all that has Pride organizers and city tourism officials hopeful that the throngs of visitors who come to take part in the various Pride activities over a period of about six weeks could double.</p><p>Fred Dixon, president and CEO of NYC & Company, the city's marketing organization, said the city's cultural institutions really responded to the anniversary.</p><p>"" We're proud of how many came forward and put together great programming,"" he said.</p><p>The spirit of protest that Stonewall represents is also represented in some events this month, including the Queer Liberation March being planned by the Reclaim Pride Coalition.</p>",896

23352,"Time for Republicans to Court Generation Z? ### By Harry Murphy ### In one of his early memoirs, Thomas Jefferson attributed to John Adams the quip that ""a boy of 15 who is not a democrat is good for nothing, and he is no better who is a democrat at 20.""  This could not be farther from the modern truth, given that most Millennials seem to perpetually express their discontentment with conservatism.  In an ABC Poll subsequent to the 2018 midterm elections, 31 percent of Millennials aged 18–29 voted Republican.  A 2018 Pew Research Center study suggests that the deficit between Millennial Republican voters and Millennial Democratic voters has increased from a 15-point disadvantage to a 27-point disadvantage. ### To even further supply evidence of Millennials disinterest in conservatism, a Harvard study concluded that 26 percent of adults aged 18–29 support President Donald J. Trump, and 11 percent of Millennials were ""sure to re-elect the President in 2020.""  Catering to the Millennial vote has left the interests of the Republican Party.  As Millennials continue to be dormant in the workplace, yield the highest expenditures out of any generation, and be consumed by student debt, they are persistently pushing the radical left movement.  But a new demographic may soon be undecided at the polls, and that is Generation Z. ### The Case for Courting Generation Z's Vote ### Young people are becoming increasingly undecided in the voting process.  In a 2018 Midterm Election Tufts study, it was discovered that youth engagement in congressional elections has peaked at 31 percent.  The voting turnout among people aged 18–29 has increased by 9% from 2000, according to a Brookings study .  Youth affiliation with the independent party has been steadily increasing over the past presidential elections.   Tufts found that almost half (43.6 percent) of people aged 18–24 did not affiliate with a political party.  The younger demographic is growing larger and more contested by year.  It would be common sense for the GOP to invest time in outreaching to the unabating growth of this new youth demographic. ### A Genetic Advantage to a New Generation: The Fertility Gap ### Although Democrats are more liberal on sex and reproduction, the actual action of conceiving a child is dominated by conservative mothers.  This fact is derived from the (lack of) importance of the construct of marriage in the Democratic Party.  In a 2005 USA Today survey , it was said that ""[o]f the 50 congressional districts with the lowest marriage rates, all are held by Democrats.""  And given that 60% of American births occur inside wedlock, marriage is a consistent indicator for childbirth. ### Conservative mothers are outpacing liberal mothers in births.  Arthur Brooks, a social scientist at Syracuse University, stated that ""[t]he political Right is having a lot more kids than the political Left.""  He elaborated that ""the [fertility] gap is actually 41 percent.""  It was studied that the ratio of children born from a conservative woman to those from a liberal woman is 2.08:1.47.  A CDC report gathered that the states with the largest fertility rates voted red in 2012, while all the states with the lowest fertility rates went blue.  In 2006, Brooks theorized that ""[a] state that was split 50-50 between left and right in 2004 will tilt right by 2012, 54% to 46%.  By 2020, it will be certifiably right-wing.""  Brooks's theory stands correct so far, at least for Ohio, which went red in the 2014 midterm elections, the 2016 presidential election, and the 2018 midterm elections.  As Democrats continue to get more abortions and pop their birth control pills, the political race is slowly turning red.  As Arthur Brooks comically concluded his study, ""Democratic politicians may have no more babies left to kiss."" ### Generation Z Is More Conservative on Social Issues ### Millennials have a notorious reputation for being the most liberal generation on paramount social issues, whereas Generation Z has taken a more conservative stance.  According to a survey by The Gild , 59 percent of Generation Z respondents stood as ""in between 'conservative' and 'moderate'"" on issues such as marijuana legalization and the transgender movement.  In comparison, 83 percent of Millennial respondents considered themselves ""'quite' or 'very liberal'"" on the same issues. ### Generation Z also has a focus on freedom of speech and civil liberties, in contrast to the Millennials, who have institutionalized ideas such as ""safe zones"" and have endorsed conservative censorship on campus.  In a FIRE (Foundation of Individual Rights in Education) survey, it was found that 89 percent of college students ""think it is important that their college or university encourages students to have a public voice and share their ideas openly,"" and 96 percent of students ""think it is important that their civil rights or liberties are protected.""  The study also found that 75 percent of students believe that they ""should have the right to free speech on campus, even if what is being said offends others."" ### On abortion, Generation Z is taking an increasingly pro-life stance.  In a Gallup poll, it was found that youths aged 18–29 were most likely to think abortion should be ""illegal under any circumstances"" than any other generation (23 percent).  The youth's position on the morality of abortion has shifted drastically over the past two decades and has increased by 11 percent since the early '90s.  A Marist poll suggested that 47 percent of adults aged 18–29 think abortion ""causes more harm than good"" in a woman's life, against 37 percent of the age group thinking it benefits a woman's life.  Generation Z is generally in support of ""banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy,"" with 44 percent thinking abortion after the 20-week mark is immoral, the largest number out of any age group.  In its few years of existence, Generation Z has veered away from the generational liberal youth standards, and statistics show that the generation's conservative voice is growing. ### An Increasingly Connected Generation ### The mainstream media have always been controlled by leftist establishmentarianism, and as liberal biased media outweigh conservative media at a ratio of 13:1 , the leftist narrative has been disseminated throughout America's most prominent stories.  The rise of the internet has changed how many receive their news; instead of dialing in to CNN, MSNBC, or CBS, Americans have been increasingly viewing the news online.  Distrust of the mainstream media has grown among consumers, as data suggest that 77 percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats ""sometimes or never"" trust the news.  Skepticism of the mainstream media and a consumer base flocking to an open-source platform will change the dynamic of how the public interprets the news.  The rise of more truthful, personable, and independent media sources could affect how Generation Z receives news. ### Generation Z is the first generation to be completely exposed to modern technology.  It is the most interconnected generation, as almost everyone is associated with others through the services of social media, mobile phones, and instant messaging.  The internet is an extraordinary apparatus, remarkably capable of calling out the media's lies.  This allows a media consumer to have multiple different perspectives and conclude, by individual virtues and beliefs, which one is correct.  This simple action was non-existent in any other generation's youth.  Generation Z has more access to conservative voices and media than any other generation. ### Those in Generation Z are rushing to the polls at an aggressive rate, proving themselves as devoted and involved citizens.  They are developing to become a contested demographic, as studies suggest that Generation Z has been affiliating as independents in large numbers.  Generation Z is becoming conservative on several key issues and is arguably the first generation that has conservative potential at the polls.  If the Republican Party wants to sustain its conservative voice through the next generation of voters, it is about time to court Generation Z's vote. ### In one of his early memoirs, Thomas Jefferson attributed to John Adams the quip that ""a boy of 15 who is not a democrat is good for nothing, and he is no better who is a democrat at 20.""  This could not be farther from the modern truth, given that most Millennials seem to perpetually express their discontentment with conservatism.  In an ABC Poll subsequent to the

31034,"How women are combating loneliness as adults ### Print ### ABC News Radio ### ABC News ### (NEW YORK) -- Join a Facebook group, meet moms on the playground, sign up for a class, get involved at church, volunteer -- the tips women hear on how to find friends are endless. ### It's just the opposite. Millennials and Gen Z, seemingly the most-connected generations, are suffering from a “loneliness epidemic.” ### Generation Z and millennials rated themselves highest on feelings associated with loneliness in a nationwide survey of adults last year by Cigna. ### Jenna Kutcher, a marketing entrepreneur with more than 800,000 Instagram followers, showed the difficulty of making deep friendships as adults last October when she posted a photo of herself on a weekend away with two fellow influencers and entrepreneurs, Rachel Hollis and Amy Porterfield. ### “I’ll be honest, I don’t have a lot of friends ... wait, what? You thought I had circles upon circles of women showing up for me in my life? Yeah, no,” she captioned the photo. “I actually really struggle with trusting people these days and making friends is awkward.” ### Kutcher urged her followers to comment on the post in order to connect and hopefully make friends. Today, more than seven months after the post, women are still commenting, looking for other women to connect with. ### Kutcher said she too still struggles with making and maintaining deep friendships, especially after becoming a mom. She gave birth to her first child, a daughter, in December. ### ""I feel like I'm having to prioritize my time in new ways, which looks like family first, then work, and then with the margin that exists is where we have time for friendships,"" she said. ""I realize this is just a season, but it does make you wonder how many others are navigating the busyness and just in that survival mode making sure that they can keep up the juggling act."" ### The Goal Digger podcast host said she has found the best friendships are with other people who ""get it,"" whether ""it"" is work, family or another type of situation. ### ""I talk to two girlfriends every single day. We all had babies one week apart and we call it 'The Mom Club,'"" she said. ""We send five-minute long voice notes ... because they are all we have time for these days, but knowing we're in this together is the biggest blessing."" ### Amy Porterfield, an online marketing trainer who joined Kutcher and Hollis on their trip last year, said the trip taught her to focus on a small group of core friends versus the days back in high school and even college when she had wide circles of friends. ### ""It all comes back to being vulnerable and open and honest,"" she said. ""I can’t do that with everybody, but I can do it with a committed group of girlfriends."" ### One of Porterfield's closest friends is Jasmine Star, a photographer and business strategist she met two years ago through work. The two see each other in person only once a month or so, but talk and text daily. ### ""It wasn’t like, 'The first thing off, let’s be best friends,'"" said Star, who stayed in touch with Porterfield via emails and then texts and phone calls. ""We got to know each other really slowly over time."" ### Star said as she has gotten older she has found herself subscribing to the ""quarter philosophy"" versus the ""penny philosophy"" of friendship, saying, ""I’d rather have four really good friends than 100 friends."" ### ""One of my good childhood friends is planning her baby shower at 39, and she said she realized that if she were to have a baby shower in her late 20s, she would have had three or four times the people,"" Star said. ""She was wondering if this was a reflection of her, but the reality is that everyone is walking a very similar path."" ### Kutcher agrees, saying, ""I think it's easy to assume you're the only one struggling with friendships. It's easy to paint the scene that everyone else has amazing friends and you're the only lonely one, but it's simply not true."" ### The types of deep friendships Kutcher, Porterfield and Star have turned to are literally good for their health, research shows. ### Being lonely or socially isolated may result in health risks ""equivalent to those of obesity or smoking up to 15 cigarettes per day,"" the president of the AARP Foundation told ABC News last month. ### Yes, they take time, and yes, they can be awkward at first, but finding true friendships as an adult is doable. ### Here are the ways Kutcher, Porterfield and Star say they have made it happen. ### 1. Connect with someone daily ### ""If you want connection, you have to connect,"" Kutcher said. ""A lot of times we know what we seek but we aren't seeking it or taking action."" ### ""My favorite thing to do is everyday think of three people that I can connect with and I'll send a voice text saying, 'Hey, no need to respond, just wanted to let you know I was thinking of you today' and then I'll share something special with them,"" she said. ""Challenge yourself today to text three friends, to call someone you miss or put a card in the mail just because."" ### 2. Ease your friendship expectations ### While it can be devastating to not immediately hear back from a friend in high school, friendships developed in adulthood don't need to carry that same angst. ### ""At our age and in this busy time in our lives, there are no expectations,"" said Porterfield. ""I don’t get my feelings hurt if I don’t hear back right away."" ### ""I had one friend who I told I was terrible about returning calls and texts and she texted back, ‘I’m so happy we can be terrible friends together,'"" Star said. ""It was so empowering."" ### ""It's so important to have friends who understand that we can jump on the phone at 6 a.m. and talk for 10 minutes,"" she added. ### 3. Make new friends but keep the old ### Just like the Girl Scouts song says, a circle of girlfriends can, and should, include women from all walks of your life. ### ""I have fostered friendships since childhood and they are part of the five women I am constantly going deep with,"" said Star. ""Three of the women are from my childhood and two are in my industry."" ### ""To have that balance of five women in my life who are so different is so helpful,"" she said. ### 4. Send friendship prompts ### Porterfield and Star live in far away from each other in California but still manage to know what is happening in each other's lives. ### They do it, they say, by sending quick text prompts. ### “”I want to hear from you. What's going on? ### ""I always, 'What’s going on? Give me an update,'"" said Porterfield. ""And she'll prompt me with, 'I want to hear from you. What's going on?'"" ### ""She may not respond to my text for 24 or 48 hours, but I always know it’s coming,"" Porterfield added. ### 5. Skip the small talk ### Once you get past the exhausting small talk that usually has to happen to create a friendship, there is no need to bring it out again. ### ""I'm introverted and small talk kills me, so unless you want to really tell me what's going on in your marriage or that hilarious thing your kid did or the way you feel like you're failing, I just can't feel invested,"" said Kutcher. ""I want friendships where I can show up, just as I am, and share openly and willingly, knowing that I am not alone or being judged."" ### Porterfield described being willing to be honest and open with a friend as ""feeding the soul."" ### ""If you’re not going deep with them, if you’re not talking to them, you’re not feeding your soul like it needs to be fed,"" she said. ### Copyright © 2019, ABC Radio.

84497,"Image ### Andrew Boguit is likely to get more time in Game 2 ### Andrew Bogut appears set to return to the Golden State Warriors’ line-up with coach Steve Kerr repeatedly praising the Australian on the eve of their crucial game two clash with the Toronto Raptors. ### The Raptors won the NBA championship series opener 118-109 on Thursday in front of a wild Toronto crowd. ### Game two is on MONDAY June 3, 10am AEST ### WATCH: Stream live on Kayo ### “Bogut can make an impact,” Kerr told reporters after the Warriors worked out at the Scotiabank Arena. ### Bogut was left on the bench in game one while Kerr used 12 other players. The Melbourne-born veteran played in 14 of the past 16 games in the Warriors’ playoff run. ### Kerr started 24-year-old forward Jordan Bell at centre in an attempt to combat the Raptors’ speed and said he “did a good job” in the loss. ### The coach was also pleased with the return of All-Star centre DeMarcus Cousins who, after sitting out six weeks of the playoffs with a quadriceps tear, had three points and two assists in eight minutes off the bench. Kerr pointed to Bogut when asked about the playmakers he has on the Warriors and also compared the Australian’s passing ability to the Raptors’ veteran centre Marc Gasol. ### Gasol had a huge impact in Toronto’s game one win with 20 points, including two open three-pointers, seven rebounds, two steals and one block. “That was not the strategy the other night – to let him stand there for six seconds,” Kerr, discussing how Gasol was repeatedly left to shoot open three- pointers, said. ### Andrew Boguit is likely to get more time in Game 2 ### “We’d like to be a little sharper than that.” Gasol also repeatedly used his size against smaller defenders for easy baskets in the key, something Bogut would limit. ### Kerr, because of injuries to Cousins, Kevin Durant and match-ups with opponents, has had eight different starting line-ups in this year’s playoffs with Bogut, Bell and Damian Jones slotted in as starting centres. “What we are always going to do is mix and match and find match-ups and fill in those gaps with the right combinations that can help us win,” Kerr said. ### “Jordan did a nice job the other night, but so did DeMarcus. “Bogut is available.” ### Durant has been ruled out of game two with his lingering calf injury, while forward/guard Andre Iguodala is expected to play despite aggravating a calf strain in game one. ### The Raptors’ breakout star in the opener was power forward Pascal Siakam who scored a career-high 32 points after averaging 14.5 points against the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals. ### The Warriors regularly put two and three defenders on the Raptors’ leader Kawhi Leonard who had 23 points after averaging 31 in the playoffs. The strategy allowed Leonard to pass to team-mates Gasol, Kyle Lowry, Danny Green and Fred VanVleet for open shots. ### “If they play defence like that, guys are going to step up and make shots,” Leonard said. ### Updates",60119,1,"Kerr, because of injuries to Cousins, Kevin Durant and match-ups with opponents, has had eight different starting line-ups in this year’s playoffs with Bogut, Bell and Damian Jones slotted in as starting centres. “ What we are always going to do is mix and match and find match-ups and fill in those gaps with the right combinations that can help us win,” Kerr said.###“ Jordan did a nice job the other night, but so did DeMarcus. “ Bogut is available. ”","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]","<p>Kerr, because of injuries to Cousins, Kevin Durant and match-ups with opponents, has had eight different starting line-ups in this year’s playoffs with Bogut, Bell and Damian Jones slotted in as starting centres. “ What we are always going to do is mix and match and find match-ups and fill in those gaps with the right combinations that can help us win,” Kerr said.</p><p>“ Jordan did a nice job the other night, but so did DeMarcus. “ Bogut is available. ”</p>",901

The city's visibly shaken mayor, Bobby Dyer, called it ""the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach."" ### The shooting happened shortly after 4 p.m. when the veteran employee of the Public Utilities Department entered a building in the city's Municipal Center, and ""immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all of the victims,"" Cervera said. Authorities did not release the suspect's name, instead choosing to focus on the victims during a news conference. ### Police entered the building and got out as many employees as they could, then exchanged fire with the suspect, who was armed with a .45 caliber handgun, the chief said. ### Police initially said the gunman shot and killed 11 people, including one who was found inside a vehicle outside the municipal building. Cervera later said one more died on the way to the hospital. ### The shooting sent shock waves through Virginia Beach, the state's largest city and a popular vacation spot in southeastern Virginia. The building where the attack took place is in a suburban complex miles away from the high-rise hotels along the beach and the downtown business area. ### Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a statement he was devastated by the ""unspeakable, senseless violence,"" and is offering the state's full support to survivors and relatives of the victims. ### ""That they should be taken in this manner is the worst kind of tragedy,"" the governor said during the news conference. ### The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed and was monitoring the situation. ### Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting happened, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded herself and about 20 colleagues inside an office, pushing a desk against a door. ### ""We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,"" she said. ""We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn't real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots."" ### She texted her mom, telling her that there was an active shooter in the building and she and others were waiting for police. ### ""Thank God my baby is OK,"" Banton's mother, Dana Showers, said. ### At a nearby middle school, friends and relatives were reuniting with loved ones who were in the building when the shooting happened. They included Paul Swain, 50, who said he saw his fiancee from across the parking lot, clearly in an agitated state. ### ""I think she knew some of the people,"" he said. ### Outside the school, Cheryl Benn, 65, waited while her husband, David, a traffic engineer with the city who was in the building where the shooting happened, gave a written statement to detectives. ### She said her husband initially called her from a barricaded room and said it sounded as if someone had been working with a nail gun.

The sounds morph into a different tones and textures as you move throughout the chambers. ### For her latest performance, Cornucopia, Björk collaborated with the engineering firm Arup to design her very own reverberation chamber, a space that she could use like a musical instrument to manipulate how her voice sounds. ### Björk’s performances today are highly produced experiences, and Cornucopia—a residency at the Shed, a new venue in Hudson Yards, that concludes June 1—is her most daring yet. Along with a roster of collaborators, she created custom costumes, visual projections, choreography, set pieces, and more. She describes it as a concert “where the acoustic and digital will shake hands.” This is where the reverberation chamber comes in. It enables Björk to bring the aural quality of a small-room performance to a sold-out concert hall. ### “She wanted to hearken back to when she would discover spaces on her own, like walking into a room within a church or a house or a library and feel the resonance of that room and explore it with her voice,” says Shane Myrbeck, an acoustic designer at Arup who worked closely with Björk on the chamber. ### “She always describes the different voices she uses with amplification—the pop by voice that she sings into a microphone with—and then the other more personal, intimate voice that she uses an acoustic space. She wanted to take that voice and transport it to a live stage experience.” ### A post shared by Björk (@bjork) on ### May 5, 2019 at 8:06pm PDT ### Some spaces naturally resonate and the acoustics depend on their dimensions and the materials they’re made of. Think of what it sounds like singing in a tiled bathroom or the echo in a long hallway. Björk used words like “sanctuary” and “chapel” to describe the type of setting she wanted to replicate, and that she wanted a long, lush reverberation. ### “She described it as kind of full and shimmery and all these different aspects that are tied to the materiality of concrete,” Myrbeck says. ### Arup tried to find real-world spaces that might give Björk’s voice the resonance she wanted. They ended up at the Sound Column, an installation at the Palace of Fine Arts. Then, they used a computer model to map how sound waves reflect and mix together in the space, and tried to replicate the same acoustic properties in a smaller structure that could be transported while touring and quickly repaired if needed. At one point, Björk toyed with the idea of wearing the chamber, like a dress. After considering a number of options, a 16-foot-wide, 10-foot-wide octagonal dome made from plaster-coated wood turned out to be the winning combination. ### The walls of the resonance chamber are very close, and it’s tall like a column. The structure is composed of ribs, as in a Gothic cathedral’s vault. Sound waves reflect off the walls very quickly and depending on where Björk stands—along the sides or in the center—the waves will achieve a different mix. And while the space was designed to mimic un-amplified resonance, there’s still a microphone inside. ### “She can be very interactive with the acoustics of the space,” Myrbeck says. ### Björk performed Cornucopia at the Shed, a new performance space in Hudson Yards, from May 6 to June 1, 2019. ### Santiago Felipe. Courtesy of Bjork and Arup. ### Through most of history, architecture, composition, and musical instruments have evolved together . Simple, harmonious melodies with few notes work in a tall cathedral, where the sound lingers and mixes. A fast, intricate Mozart piano piece would quickly devolve into cacophony if performed in such a space. Wagner designed his own opera house to accommodate a larger orchestra than what was typically used at the time. The term “reverb chamber” actually goes back to old recording studios: Before digital processing could create reverb, producers would play a track in an empty concrete room and record the effect. ### “Pieces of music are almost designed for the architecture in which they sit, so there is a symbiotic relationship between that which exists really until the middle of the 20th century,” says Raj Patel, Arup’s global leader of arts and culture. “Now, people are going back to site specific works again.” ### Arup flipped the script on that relationship by designing a space for a performance, honoring history and while being rooted in experimentation. That perfectly sums up who Björk is as a performer. ### “Björk finds herself simultaneously tied to this long and ancient history of singing, which is one of the oldest things you can think of, and then being a cutting-edge technologist at the same time,” says Myrbeck. “A really nice thing about this chamber [is that] we used a very technical process to design it, but the effect of it is to strip all that away and just have this pure acoustic experience.” ### Curbed Daily Newsletter",60119,1,"Arup flipped the script on that relationship by designing a space for a performance, honoring history and while being rooted in experimentation.

She added that she has yet to receive the actual visa or set a date for her trip. ### If she could bring him anything, she said, it would be his favorite Mexican food dish: enchiladas. ### Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obradór lobbied for the visa to be issued after receiving a letter in February from Loera asking for assistance. In the letter, passed to Lopez Obradór while he was in Guzman's home state of Sinaloa to announce a highway project, Loera described herself as ""suffering and desperate"" to see her son. ### The president said he intervened out of empathy for the mother.

Both possibilities seem highly unlikely. ### Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 after having served eight years.

She was the only passenger. ### It was the second fatal crash for the Ketchikan-based Taquan Air in less than week. On May 13, a Taquan floatplane on a flightseeing tour collided mid-air with another floatplane. Six people died and 10 people were injured. ### The NTSB preliminary report cites no cause for the second crash. ### Managers at Taquan Air told investigators that Rash, who is not named in the NTSB report, was a new seasonal hire for the 2019 season. ### He held a commercial pilot certificate with single-engine land, single-engine sea and instrument airplane ratings. ### When he started Taquan orientation on April 22, he had accumulated more than 1,600 flight hours but just five in airplanes equipped with floats. He completed check rides in a float-equipped plane on May 3 and initial operation experience requirements on May 11. ### The floatplane crashed on a scheduled flight while landing after a 22-mile (35-kilometer) flight from Ketchikan. ### An airport near the crash site reported winds at 11.5 mph (18.5 kph), visibility of 10 miles (16 kilometers) and clear skies. ### Three witnesses said the floatplane's approach to the harbor was normal. ### Two said that just before the floats touched the water, the airplane's wings rocked left and then right. One witness said the right wing struck the water and the airplane flipped nose-first. ### A witness from a fishing boat said he saw the right float ""dig into the water"" before the airplane nosed over. The right wing and right lift strut broke off and sank. They have not been recovered. ### The cockpit and airplane cabin partially sank. Two boats rushed to aid the plane and a fishing boat hoisted the tail slightly out of the water. The good Samaritans and Metlakatla emergency medical technicians removed the pilot and passenger from the plane. They were declared dead at Annette Island Health Center.",60119,1,"news 20 hours ago The Associated Press — By DAN JOLING - Associated Press###ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A pilot who crashed a commercial floatplane while landing at a southeast Alaska village had just five hours of floatplane experience when he began his company orientation in April, according to federal investigators.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]","<p>news 20 hours ago The Associated Press — By DAN JOLING - Associated Press</p><p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A pilot who crashed a commercial floatplane while landing at a southeast Alaska village had just five hours of floatplane experience when he began his company orientation in April, according to federal investigators.</p>",915

43312,"Email ### In the grand scheme of things, Will Arndt may be the backup to the backup to the backup quarterback for the Ottawa Redblacks. ### If it stays that way, he may not see the football field during a regular-season game in 2019. It’s not like he’s given up hope of playing — his résumé suggests he’s capable of big things with a football in his hand — but it seems clearly established that Dominique Davis and Jonathan Jennings are 1-2, not necessarily in that order, and Danny Collins suited up as the third-stringer a year ago. ### But Arndt is the kind of player professional football teams need. In his third season with the Redblacks, he isn’t whining. He knows what his role is — to be a contributor in the “quarterback room,” to have dialogue with the other three and help with game preparations. It’s all about fitting in as part of a team. ### “I approach it the same really as any other year,” said the 25-year-old Arndt. “The dynamic is a bit different, the people in the (locker) room are a bit different. But ultimately it’s a group of great guys. Anything outside of that doesn’t help any of us. Coming out here, competing, sharing what we know and playing good football is really my focus. That hasn’t changed since I got here. My focus is to try and get one per cent better every day, keep at it and keep working.” ### Having the guys in the quarterback room on the save wavelength is important. They can’t all be spinning in different directions with individual agendas. ### “It’s a very important dynamic,” said Arndt. “If you have a bad quarterback room, it’s not a good environment to be in. We’re all competitors. Everyone knows their role. We’re in the pre-season so I know all four of us are looking forward to getting out there and playing football. What will be will be.” ### He will get a chance in Saturday night’s pre-season home game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, either in the third or fourth quarter. It’s likely he’ll get even more playing time next Thursday in the team’s second and final pre-season game in Montreal. ### All four of the Redblacks’ quarterbacks are expected to play against the Ticats. Asked about how much playing time each will get, Redblacks coach Rick Campbell said: “Dominique Davis is going to play the first quarter, Jennings is going to play the second quarter and then Collins and Arndt will play in the second half. We’re going to play all four guys. If there’s some weird scenario where a guy doesn’t get a lot of reps in a quarter, we might let him go into the next quarter. We have a planned rotation on all positions that we will stick to regardless of score. We want to win the game, but we want to do it with everyone out here. I’m excited to see them play.” ### “Everyone knows their spot. I’m looking forward to getting out there — hair on fire and guns-a-blazing — playing ball,” said Arndt. ### “He came (into training camp) really well prepared this year,” said Campbell. “He’s a really good teammate, he’s not a selfish guy. He shares with the other quarterbacks, they’re all just trying to make each other better, and he definitely fits into that.” ### Arndt holds several Western Connecticut State University records, including passing yards in a career (7,940), TDs in a career: 91 (73 passing, 17 rushing, one at WR). He was also a three-time captain and twice was on the All Academic Team. Finding his way in the CFL game has been a work in progress. ### “It’s slowed down for me,” he said. “I have a better command of how things are supposed to go, how you’re supposed to carry yourself.” ### TAKING A BREAK: The Redblacks will rest a few of their projected starters, along with some guys who are a bit “nicked up” for Saturday’s game. Not playing: Receivers Brad Sinopoli, Wesley Lewis, Darius Powe and Noel Thomas II, defensive back Antoine Pruneau, linebackers Anthony Cioffi, Shaheed Salmon, Kevin Francis and Charles Brousseau, running back Brendan Gillanders, offensive linemen Andrew Pickett and Stephane Nemot, and defensive linemen Nigel Romick, Ettore Lattanzio, Maximillano Soto, Michael Klassen and Danny Mason. Said Campbell: “Some of those guys are known commodities; we want to make sure the new guys get a real good look.” Newcomer Ironhead Gallon starts at SAM linebacker. Also, of note, it’s an all Canadian offensive line starting. Carleton’s Justin Howell starts at safety. ### THE TICAT REPORT: The Ticats are leaving several starters, including QB Jeremiah Masoli and receivers Brandon Banks and Luke Tasker, in Hamilton. Of note, former Carleton Raven and Calgary Stampeder defensive back Tunde Adeleke starts at safety, while former Raven Michael Domagala will be the kicker/punter. Former Ottawa Gee-Gee Jackson Bennett is listed as the backup running back. ### WE THE NORTH: There’s a playful divide in the Redblacks’ locker room — and it has nothing to with football. It’s about basketball — Toronto Raptors versus Golden State Warriors. Count receiver Nate Behar among those cheering mightily for the Raptors. Behar, who’s from London, grew up a Raptors fan. ### “The Americans, they have their bias,” said Behar with a laugh Friday. “I reminded a lot of guys that Dr. James Naismith is Canadian and we created this game — they don’t seem to remember that. Me and my brother tried to make it our mission every year — when I was eight, nine, 10 — to watch all 82 games. That was back in the Anthony Parker, Rafael Araujo days, the rough days when Junkyard Dog (Jerome Williams) was our crown jewel. It’s a fun time to be a Raptors fan.” ### IT’S GAME TIME: Defensive back Chris Randle, a huge off-season free-agent signing, is looking forward to playing his first game as a Redblack, even if it is just pre-season. Said Randle: “Any time you get lights and the scoreboard going, it’s meaningful football. Camp has its purpose, but now it’s time to put forward what we’ve been learning.” … Asked how much the Redblacks’ decision makers would be influenced by a pre-season game, Campbell said: “It’s big. We take into account the whole body of work. You want to see what guys do day in and day out, but obviously it’s a big part of the equation. You want to see how a guy can apply what he’s learned in practice and in the meeting room when the lights are on and the scoreboard is on and a different team is here. The one place I’ve tried to develop as a coach as I get older is keep an open mind. I don’t think we’d do ourselves any favours by pre-determining things. Our job right now is to coach them up, keep an open mind and let the players decide it on the field.” ### ALSO IN THE NEWS:",60119,1,"But Arndt is the kind of player professional football teams need.

Trump supporters counter that the United States has been taken for granted for too long and its needs must now come first. ### Private security and Swiss police cordoned off sidewalks and limited traffic near the bright-yellow Fairmont Le Montreux Palace overlooking Lake Geneva, where the meeting was taking place this year. A handful of placard-waving protesters voiced their opposition peacefully outside the gates. ### The event, which aims to foster dialogue between experts from North America and Europe, is closed off to the public, and attendees are encouraged to keep quiet about what is said inside. On the agenda this year were topics like Europe, China and Russia, climate change, the future of capitalism and cyberthreats. ### The meeting's theme this year - ""A Stable Strategic Order"" - was something that Trump critics said the U.S. leader and his advisers should ponder. ### ""What we have is an administration that is behaving like a unilateralist wrecking ball,"" said Ken Oye, an MIT political science professor on sabbatical in Switzerland, who came to protest. ### He predicted those are the meeting ""are likely to be telling him 'that you're not serving American interests or international interests more broadly defined. You're making a mistake, and here are the reasons why we believe so.'"" ### Many at the meeting have championed cooperation in tackling international issues and have bemoaned Trump's ""America First"" approach, which has broken with decades of U.S. policy. ### Among the notable Europeans attending this year are NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen and the British and Danish intelligence chiefs, Jeremy Fleming and Lars Findsen. ### In addition to Kushner and Pompeo, both of whom are currently on major diplomatic missions, at least two senior Pentagon officials and two senior members of the National Security Council were at the forum. ### Attendees from media outfits like Bloomberg, The Economist and The Washington Post were rubbing elbows with political leaders such as rising Democratic Party personality Stacey Abrams and chiefs of international organizations like the U.N. cultural agency and animal rights group WWF. ### Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, arrived from Tel Aviv after a three-nation Middle East tour aimed at building support for his yet unreleased Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. ### Pompeo came to Switzerland from Germany as part of a four-country European tour dominated by increasing tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Pompeo is seeking to assure European leaders that despite U.S. intentions to step up economic pressure on Iran with sanctions, the U.S. is not seeking war with the Islamic Republic and may explore opening a channel of communications with Tehran. ### Trump has openly signaled that he wants to talk to Iranian leaders and neutral Switzerland, which has long represented U.S. interests in Iran, could be a convenient emissary. ### Pompeo will meet the Swiss foreign minister on Sunday, prompting speculation toward that end. ### ""I'm not going to talk about how we're communicating or not communicating with (Iran),"" Pompeo told reporters on his plane. Asked why he was spending three days in Bern - the Swiss capital that was last visited by a U.S. secretary of state more than two decades ago - he replied coyly only that he's a ""big cheese and chocolate fan."" ### Before heading to Montreux, Pompeo visited the old city of Bern, touring the UNESCO World Heritage Site with his wife, Susan, U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland, Ed McMullen, a number of aides and a large security contingent. ### The 40-minute stroll included stops at the historic 15th-century Bern Minster cathedral, walking by the apartment where Albert Einstein developed his Theory of Relativity while working at the Swiss patent office from 1903-1905, and seeing the city's 13th-century Zytglogge, or ""Time bell"" clock tower, which is said to have inspired Einstein. ### ___",60119,1,"MONTREUX, Switzerland (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday joined Jared Kushner at a closed-doors meeting of the Bilderberg Group in the Swiss resort of Montreux, with many attendees uneasy about what one protester called the ""wrecking ball"" that President Donald Trump's administration has taken to the postwar international order.###The annual gathering of high-profile participants from business, politics, intelligence and defense saw a visit from America's top diplomat just as freshly-announced Trump tariffs on Mexico rattled world markets and U.S. tensions with Iran raised world concerns.###The four-day meeting that ends Sunday comes as Trump critics argue that his rhetoric and policies are a threat to the globalist postwar stability that was largely born of U.S. leadership.

The tank standoff, memorialized by several photographers including Jeff Widener of The Associated Press , has become a symbol of defiance around the world. ### Hundreds of people walked by the installation Saturday morning. Many took selfies and photos of the artwork, which has been up for a few weeks. ### While public remembrances of the Tiananmen protests are strictly forbidden in mainland China, there are regular commemorations in democratically governed Taiwan and Hong Kong, China's semi-autonomous southern region. Next Tuesday marks 30 years since the protests, led by students who were joined by individuals from all walks of life, calling for political reform. ### China's ruling Communist Party punishes citizens who dare to speak publicly about the event. While an untold number of people inside China are even unaware of this historic event, others have learned about it through smuggled DVDs and private conversations as well as using software to scale the internet firewall. ### Mikel Zhang, a lawyer from Shanghai who visited the ""Tank Man"" installation Saturday morning, said that the students' beliefs were different than those of the government. ""But eventually ... blood was shed,"" he said. ### An inscription for the artwork says Taiwan stands with the people who have never ceased to resist the ""gigantic autocracy."" ### Taiwan split from mainland China amid civil war in 1949, though Beijing still claims the island as part of its territory. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

6264,"5:30 a.m., June 1 ###  ### JUBA, South Sudan — In a story May 29 about South Sudan's oil production, The Associated Press reported erroneously that production in Unity state has increased to 175,000 barrels a day. That amount is for the entire country. ### A corrected version of the story is below: ### South Sudan struggles to increase oil production after war ### South Sudan struggles to increase oil production after civil war, hurting recovery efforts ### By SAM MEDNICK ### Associated Press ### JUBA, South Sudan — Oil-rich South Sudan is struggling to increase production of crude several months after the end of its civil war, and the political upheaval in neighboring Sudan is in part to blame. ### The signing of a peace deal in September helped open the way to resuming drilling in South Sudan's key region of Unity state, but output has been more sluggish than expected in the country with Africa's third-largest oil reserves. ### ""We had wanted to be farther along but it's not an easy task,"" the oil ministry's director-general, Awow Daniel Chuang, told The Associated Press. That has hurt recovery from a five-year conflict that killed nearly 400,000 people. Billions of dollars in oil revenue were lost during the war as many oil rigs were shut down or destroyed. ### Production in South Sudan has increased to 175,000 barrels a day since September but is far from the target of 200,000 barrels. Before the civil war began in late 2013, production across the country had been about 350,000 barrels a day, according to the oil ministry. ### Chuang attributed the slow recovery in part to technical challenges, the lack of funds for new machinery and fluctuating oil prices. ### The surprise ouster of Sudan's long-time dictator Omar al-Bashir in April also has complicated recovery. South Sudan and Sudan share an oil pipeline and other resources, and earlier this month South Sudan's oil minister had to travel to Sudan to release materials stranded at Port Sudan, the sole port for South Sudan's oil exports, because workers were busy protesting issues related to the post-Bashir transition. ### Despite the obstacles, South Sudan's government says it should come close to achieving its oil production target by year's end when it expects all five rigs in Unity state to be operational. Three are now functional. ### But industry experts say the reality on the ground has shocked potential investors and is starkly different from what the government is conveying, Shawn Duthie, senior analyst with Africa Risk Consulting, told the AP. ### ""Our in-country sources have said that oil production has not really increased in the north and that infrastructure in some parts of Unity state were almost non-existent,"" Duthie said. ### The International Monetary Fund, which visited South Sudan earlier this year, cited an increased daily oil production of about 20 percent. That contrasts the government's numbers, which reflect twice that amount. ### South Sudan's oil ministry said it needs approximately $1.5 billion over the next five years to invest in updated equipment to extract more oil and map unexplored areas. Many of the country's oil fields are old, which means they are producing more water than oil, the ministry said. ### The government is reaching out to foreign investors. South Africa this month signed a $1 billion deal for oil exploration and production expected to begin this year. ### South Sudan's oil sector continues to face scrutiny by the international community as a ""major driver"" of violence and human suffering, according to a report by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan in February. ### The sector is also accused by human rights groups, the U.N. Security Council and others of lacking transparency. ### Earlier this month President Salva Kiir confirmed plans to allot 30,000 barrels of oil per day to fund a road construction project signed with China's state-owned Shandong Hi-Speed Group. Instead of putting the oil money into South Sudan's Central Bank, as stipulated by last year's peace deal, the money is being deposited into a ""special fund"" in China to make the transfers easier, Information Minister Michael Makuei told the AP. ### The deal is sounding ""loud alarm bells"" due to its lack of transparency and accountability, said Nelly Busingye, regional coordinator for east and southern Africa for Publish What You Pay, a global campaign for an open and accountable extractive industry. ### ""This is all the more alarming because in recent years oil revenue has been used to procure weapons, fund militias and line the pockets of those in power,"" said Brian Adeba, deputy director of policy at the Enough Project, a Washington-based advocacy group. ### ___",60119,1,""" We had wanted to be farther along but it's not an easy task,"" the oil ministry's director-general, Awow Daniel Chuang, told The Associated Press.

38123,"Arrest in 43-year-old murder case stuns Wisconsin town ### By ### June 1, 2019 ### 9 ### LAKEWOOD, Wis. (AP) — Word of the arrest — via a friend’s text message — hit Wayne Sankey like a thunderbolt. ### “I said, ‘You gotta be kidding me,'” Sankey recalled. “And then I told the wife and she couldn’t believe it. ‘There’s no way,’ she said. ‘Ray down the road?'” ### Ray Vannieuwenhoven was his next-door neighbor — a helpful, 82-year-old handyman with a gravelly voice and a loud, distinctive laugh, the kind of guy who always waved from his car. ### The widower and father of five grown children had lived quietly for two decades among the 800 residents of Lakewood, a northern Wisconsin town surrounded by forests and small lakes. ### Now authorities were saying this man was a cold-blooded killer. They had used genetic genealogy to crack a cold case that stretched back well into the 20th century — a double murder 25 miles southwest of Lakewood. ### For nearly 43 years, Vannieuwenoven had lived in plain sight, yet outside detectives’ radar. ### It was just too much to be believed. Was the guy next door really a monster? ### ___ ### David Schuldes and Ellen Matheys, engaged to be married, set up their campsite at a secluded spot in McClintock Park on Friday afternoon, July 9, 1976. ### It appeared they were alone. ### Schuldes was a 25-year-old part-timer in the circulation department of the Green Bay Press-Gazette; Matheys, 24, worked at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay library. ### They were about to go for a walk, according to court documents and news reports of the time. First, Matheys stopped to use the restroom. ### Two shots from a .30-caliber rifle shattered the quiet. One bullet struck Schuldes’ neck from 50 feet away, killing him instantly. The other bullet lodged in a bathroom wall. ### Matheys ran, with the killer in pursuit, investigators say. He caught and raped her, then shot her twice in the chest. ### Her body was found 200 yards from where Schuldes lay, a camera slung over his shoulder. ### Investigators were stumped: The killer took no money and left Matheys’ purse in the couple’s car. They didn’t know why the couple was targeted, and leads were scant. For months, campers avoided McClintock Park. ### DNA profiling in the ’90s brought new hope, but detectives got no matches when they submitted the semen from Matheys’ shorts to the FBI’s national database. ### Last year, detectives contacted Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a DNA technology company whose work with genetic genealogy analysis has helped police identify 55 suspects in cold cases nationwide since May 2018, according to the company. Parabon uploads DNA from crime scenes to GEDmatch, a free, public genealogy database with about 1.2 million profiles, all voluntarily submitted by people who’ve used consumer genealogy sites like Ancestry.com and 23andMe. ### California law enforcement used GEDmatch to capture the Golden State Killer last year by finding distant relatives and reverse-engineering his family tree. ### Parabon’s experts completed Vannieuwenhoven’s family tree in late December. They’d found his parents, who had lived in the Green Bay area. Now detectives needed DNA samples from Vannieuwenhoven and his three brothers. Two were ruled out with DNA samples collected from one brother’s trash and another’s used coffee cup. ### On March 6, two sheriff’s deputies knocked on Vannieuwenhoven’s door, pretending they wanted him to fill out a brief survey on area-policing. They told him to put the survey in an envelope and seal it with his tongue. ### Detectives didn’t need to visit the fourth brother. Eight days later, Vannieuwenhoven was in custody. ### ___ ### At Vannieuwenhoven’s first court appearance, on March 22, bond was set at $1 million. ### “Not guilty, not guilty, not guilty,” Vannieuwenhoven said, when the judge asked him if he understood the charges. His next court date is June 19. ### Kurt Schuldes, 68, a cousin of David Schuldes in Green Bay, welcomed the news of an arrest, but lamented the time it took: “He just got away with it for way too long, unfortunately.” ### “It was a long time coming,” said Cynthia Chizek, Matheys’ 53-year-old niece, who lives in Henderson, Nevada. “It’s just something that always hangs over your head, knowing that there’s someone out there who did this heinous crime.” ### Prosecutors and Lakewood residents, meanwhile, were left with the question: Who is Raymand Lawrence Vannieuwenhoven? ### Richard Leurquin, twin brother of Vannieuwenhoven’s dead wife, Rita, said his brother-in-law was “a very loving father to his wife and kids.” He’s convinced Vannieuwenhoven is innocent. ### The Vannieuwenhovens were married until her death in 2008, a few months after they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Sankey said after Rita died, Vannieuwenhoven spent his days fishing, hunting, and going on weeks-long camping trips. ### But Vannieuwenhoven had a dark side. To start, this isn’t his first time in jail. ### In 1957, when he was 20, married, and going by the name Lawrence Vannieuwenhoven, he was jailed for six months for an unprovoked attack on a 17-year-old girl. She was walking with three friends when Vannieuwenhoven struck her on the back, face, and shoulder. Shortly before, police said, Vannieuwenhoven also tried to attack a 16-year-old girl. ### Vannieuwenhoven said before sentencing he “was only trying to scare the girls,” the Press-Gazette reported at the time. ### In 1960, he pleaded guilty to not providing financial support to his wife and their 1-year-old daughter, the Press-Gazette reported then. He was on probation for a year. ### More recently, some neighbors caught glimpses of a menacing side when he drank. He stopped only a few years ago, for his health, they said. ### “I know this much — when he was drinking he was one son of a bitch. You didn’t want to be anywhere near him when he was drinking. Not just me, a lot of people,” said Fred Mason, 66, who works at the town dump where Vannieuwenhoven was seen frequently, rummaging through scrap piles for small engine parts. ### Robert Ganzell, 86, and his wife sometimes dined out with Vannieuwenhoven. He heard from others that he had a temper when he drank, but Ganzell said he never witnessed it. ### As for the murder charges, Ganzell was nonplussed. “Never thought of it being him, doing anything like that,” Ganzell said. Aside from that, he had little to say about Vannieuwenhoven. ### In fact, the neighbors realized that they knew little about this man. For instance, it’s unclear where he worked before retiring. Sankey said he’s heard Vannieuwenhoven was an iron worker, but he also told Sankey he used to haul and deliver boats. ### Sankey, 68, said he and his wife are still coming to terms with the allegations against their next-door neighbor, the guy who would occasionally repair his lawnmower or snow blower. ### “People had the impression that he was a very good, normal person, just a retired guy,” Sankey said. “No matter where you went you’d mention Ray and they’d say, ‘Oh yeah, old Ray.’ That was basically about it. It’s still hard to believe.” ### ___",60119,1,"“ It was a long time coming,” said Cynthia Chizek, Matheys’ 53-year-old niece, who lives in Henderson, Nevada. “ It’s just something that always hangs over your head, knowing that there’s someone out there who did this heinous crime. ”###Prosecutors and Lakewood residents, meanwhile, were left with the question: Who is Raymand Lawrence Vannieuwenhoven?###Richard Leurquin, twin brother of Vannieuwenhoven’s dead wife, Rita, said his brother-in-law was “a very loving father to his wife and kids. ” He’s convinced Vannieuwenhoven is innocent.###The Vannieuwenhovens were married until her death in 2008, a few months after they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.

28875,"Mueller says charging Trump was 'not an option' ### Washington (CNN) ### President Donald Trump set the stage for his upcoming visit to the United Kingdom, Ireland and France next week during a wide-ranging interview with the British newspaper The Sun , weighing in on everything from outgoing UK Prime Minister Theresa May's handling of Brexit to the contenders vying to replace her to Meghan Markle's dislike of his politics. ### May will formally step down as Conservative Party leader after Trump visits on June 7. ### Trump, during his Oval Office interview with the Sun published Friday, criticized May's efforts on Brexit, saying he thinks ""the UK allowed the European Union to have all the cards."" ### ""I had mentioned to Theresa that you have got to build up your ammunition. ... I am sure that you could have built up a big advantage for your side and negotiated from strength,"" he said. ### ""And it is very hard to play well when one side has all the advantage,"" he continued. ""They had nothing to lose. They didn't give the European Union anything to lose."" ### Read More ### However, he acknowledged , ""at the same time, I respect Theresa and she would certainly know the facts a lot better than I know them."" ### The royal family ### During his interview with The Sun, Trump was confronted by comments made by Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, ahead of the 2016 election. ### Speaking on ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore"" in 2016, Markle called Trump misogynistic and said his politics are divisive, saying she would move to Canada if he won the presidency. ### Trump responded, ""I didn't know that she was nasty. I hope she is OK. ..."" He seemed to bury the hatchet saying, ""I am sure she will go excellently (as a royal). She will be very good."" ### The US President also previewed his meeting with Prince Charles in the UK, where talks of climate change are expected. ### ""Well, we will be talking, we will be talking. I can say we have among the cleanest climate in the world right now. Our air and water are doing very well,"" Trump said. ### However, despite Trump's claim, the 20th annual State of the Air report, supported by the American Lung Association, found that pollution in the US has gotten measurably worse over the last three years . ### Boris Johnson and contenders to replace May ### May's June resignation will trigger a party leadership contest, and once a new party leader is in place she will no longer be Prime Minister, a process that could take weeks, if not months. ### The Tory leadership contest that will decide May's successor will be an internal party vote. The Conservative Party leadership will narrow it down to two candidates and then it goes to party membership. ### Trump expressed his support for Boris Johnson, calling him ""a very good guy, a very talented person."" ### ""I think Boris would do a very good job,"" the President told The Sun. ""I think he would be excellent."" ### Earlier this week, Trump also said he ""may"" meet Johnson and Nigel Farage during the trip. ### He also showed favor for British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. ### ""Yup, I like him,"" he said. ### The President criticized contenders such as Environment Secretary Michael Gove for accusing him of ""sabre rattling"" over Iran and called out Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for not attending the Queen's state banquet, saying Corbyn is ""making a mistake."" ### CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",60119,1,""" Well, we will be talking, we will be talking.

76733,"Pacific ### During speech, Philippines president says he is ex-gay, then kisses women to prove he's 'cured' ### Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte attends a briefing in Manila, capital of the Philippines, on May 9, 2017. During a speech in Japan on Thursday, May 30, 2019, Duterte, accused a rival politician of being gay and confessed that he'd also been gay, but he had been ""cured."" ### WANG YU/XINHUA/SIPA USA/TNS ### More ### By MURI ASSUNÇÃO | New York Daily News | Published: June 1, 2019 ### (Tribune News Service) — The controversial resident of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, accused a rival politician of being gay during a speech in Japan on Thursday, and confessed that he'd also been gay, but he had ""cured"" himself after he began a relationship with his first wife. ### Duterte concluded the speech inviting four women to kiss him. ### According to CNN Philippines, the women whom he called on stage to share a kiss had very similar features: long silky hair, slender bodies, and pale skin. And they also had to meet a few requirements: ""First, you shouldn't be married, OK? Second, you're not a minor,"" he said before starting the mini kiss-a-thon. ### ""Those four. Come here. Let them in, come on, let them in,"" said the president. ### His spokesperson, Salvador Panelo, filmed the public display of awkwardness on his cell phone, while Senator-elect Bong Go, a staunch supporter of the president, watched the scene with a less-than-amused look. ### During the speech, Duterte had poked fun at his political rival Antonio Trillanes IV, a retired Navy officer who currently serves as a senator, who's a married father of two children. ### According to the Filipino news site Rappler, the president said that a gay person had told him that, based on his movements, the senator was gay: ""I said, 'Are you sure?' They said, 'You ask any gay person who sees Trillanes move, they'll say he's gay.' No wonder. Good thing Trillanes and I are similar. But I cured myself."" ### He went on to explain how he was to become an ex-gay person: ""When I began a relationship with [former wife] Elizabeth Zimmerman, I said, this is it. I became a man again."" ### Duterte's apparent ex-gay status comes after a lifetime of political flip-flopping on the issue: during his presidential campaign, Duterte appeared to have liberal issues on homosexuality, but changed his tone after he was elected, according to Rappler. ### In March 2017, he affirmed that marriage was only between a man and a woman, but later in the year told an LGBTQ crowd that he thought that the law can be changed to allow same-sex marriage. ### Duterte often uses terms like ""bakla"" and ""bayot,"" offensive words that mean gay, as insults to his political enemies, and in 2016 he called then-U.S. ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg a gay ""son of a w---e."" ### ___ ### (c)2019 New York Daily News ### Visit New York Daily News at www.nydailynews.com ### Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",60119,1,"According to the Filipino news site Rappler, the president said that a gay person had told him that, based on his movements, the senator was gay: ""I said, 'Are you sure?'

""I looked at it as a chronic stressor. Our results showed that racial discrimination appears to trigger an inflammatory response among African Americans at the cellular level."" ### The survival of all living things depends on their ability to respond to infections, stresses and injuries. Such threats trigger an immune system response to fend off pathogens and repair damaged tissues. A select group of genes are key to this defense mechanism, and inflammation is a sign that those genes are working to counter the threat or repair the damage. ### Inflammation serves to protect an organism from a health threat. But if someone feels under threat for long periods of time, their health may suffer significantly with chronic inflammation. ### ""If those genes remain active for an extended period of time, that can promote heart attacks, neurodegenerative diseases, and metastatic cancer,"" says co-author Steve Cole of the University of California, Los Angeles. ### In previous studies, Cole had found that inflammatory responses are heightened among people in socially-marginalized, isolated groups. ""We've seen this before in chronic loneliness, poverty, PTSD, and other types of adversity,"" he says. ""But until now, nobody had looked at the effects of discrimination."" ### Inflammation's link to racism ### For the study, Thames and her co-authors focused on a group of 71 subjects: two-thirds of them were African Americans; the others were white. ### In addition, 38 of the participants were positive for HIV. Their participation gave scientists a chance to study the effects of racism independently from the effects of the disease. ### The scientists extracted RNA from the participants' cells and measured molecules that trigger inflammation, as well as those involved in antiviral responses. The research team found higher levels of the inflammatory molecules in African American participants. ### The results also indicate that racism may account for as much as 50 percent of the heightened inflammation among African Americans, including those who were positive for HIV. ### Ruling out other stressors ### The scientists made sure that all the participants had similar socioeconomic background to account for financial stressors, which eliminated poverty as a potential factor for chronic inflammation among the people in the study. ### ""Racial discrimination is a different type of chronic stressor than poverty,"" Thames says. ""People navigate poverty on a day-to-day basis and are aware that it is happening. They might even be able to address financial stressors through job changes, changes in earnings and financial management. But with discrimination, you don't always realize that it's happening."" ### Individuals' decisions or lifestyles can reduce the ill effects of some stressors, but racial discrimination is a chronic stressor that people have no control over. ""You can't change your skin color,"" she says. ### Thames notes that this latest study has an obvious limitation: The sample size was small. But she says the results signal that scientists should repeat the study with a larger sample to fully determine the inflammatory effects of racism on people of color. ### Co-authors of the study included Cole, Michael Irwin and Elizabeth Breen from UCLA. ### The study was supported by an estimated $1 million in grants from multiple sources, including the National Institute of Health's National Center for Advancing Translational Science, UCLA, the USC/UCLA Center on Biodemography and Population Health and the Claude D. Pepper Older Adults Independent Centers at the National Institute on Aging. ### advertisement ### Story Source: ### Materials provided by University of Southern California .

4504,"More Articles ### June 01, 2019 ### Every Netflix subscriber knows how hard it can be to find something that delivers exactly what you want. When you search for a thriller, you’re probably thinking more Silence of the Lambs rather than Limitless or The Perfection starring Allison Williams . But guess which movies Netflix recommends? ### That right there has been a problem for the streaming service, though to its credit the film selection has improved in recent months. As for great original comedies, Netflix’s roster got smaller with the end of American Vandal following Season Two. ### Enter a new offering from Andy Samberg and his Lonely Island crew. With the premiere of the 30-minute “visual poem” The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience, The Lonely Island has the most hilarious thing going on the streaming service. ### You don’t have to be a fan of hip-hop, baseball, the 1980s Oakland A’s, or Miami Vice style to enjoy this suite of music and absurd interludes. But we guarantee there’s something for everyone in this wild ride. ### Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco’s thirst for steroids and quest for love ### The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience | Netflix ### Things get off to a rollicking start when Akiva Schaffer (Mark McGwire) and Samberg (Jose Canseco) introduce themselves on the first track, “Uniform On.” If the contrast between the flamboyant Canseco and insanely boring McGwire doesn’t get you laughing, the Beasties Boys parody will. ### It’s impressive how many jokes the Lonely Island can pack into a few bars of music. For fans of the trio (which includes Jorma Taccone), that isn’t anything new. From “Lazy Sunday” on at SNL, the group’s digital shorts have always been wild rides. ### The other brilliant thing about the trio is how solid their music has been over the years. You find yourself singing along to tunes with ridiculous subject matter, but you’re unable to do anything about it. ### That tradition holds with “Uniform On” with its riffs on bad sex, meathead gym culture, and the ’80s ballplayer lifestyle. Unlike on SNL, The Lonely Island doesn’t have to bleep its NSFW content here, and the result is glorious. You’ll know right away if this material is for you. (It is.) ### ‘Unauthorized’ doesn’t lose steam as the saga continues. ### The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience | Netflix ### After the first two blockbuster tracks, you start to worry the gang might run out of material. However, they have been working on Bash Brothers tunes since the 2018 Clusterfest , and had 10 songs in the can when they started filming. It doesn’t lose steam at all in the second half. ### Guest appearances by Maya Rudolph, Jenny Slate, HAIM, and many others keep the visuals entertaining. (Sterling K. Brown lip-syncs a Sia vocal early on in the special.) You’ll get references to ’80s girl-groups and ’90s West Coast hip-hop along the way as well. ### How funny does it get? We’ll let Jose and Mark speak for themselves. During one dramatic vocal, they pause for some call-and-repsonse introspection. “Where is the limit?” “There are no limits.” “What is the goal?” ### “To make dad love me,” they rap, with building intensity. ### “To make dad love me!” ### “TO MAKE DAD LOVE ME!” ### “TO MAKE DAD FINALLY LOVE ME!” ### If that doesn’t work, you’ll have to settle for “bench. pressing. bodacious babes. in bikinis.” ### 2019 Showbiz Cheat Sheet, All Rights Reserved.",60119,1,"How funny does it get?

Others were no more than a year or two old. ### Prior to Friday’s sectional at Meadow Valley, the program’s last championship came in 2002. Seventeen years later, a trophy is making its way back to Emma. ### The Warriors shot a 329 to take the top team spot in the Northridge Sectional, besting Concord and Goshen, both of which shot 337. Concord placed second due to its fifth score. ### Senior Carter Giggy led the Warriors with a 78, good for second place individually and one shot out of first, which was claimed by NorthWood’s Sean Hogan (77). ### Giggy was happy his team won, but also realized his own final score could have been much better. ### “There were probably five or six shots that I left out there,” he said. ### Giggy mentioned putting as an area in which he could have done better. The greens at Meadow Valley are notoriously hard — balls travel fast and the grass surrounding them can be hard to chip out of. If there was one thing that kept him from claiming medalist honors, it was this. ### “They’re just super inconsistent,” Giggy said. “With all the different hills, you really have to place your ball on them just right. Because if you don’t then you’re gonna get into some trouble.” ### Brian Titus shot an 82 in the 18-hole meet to finish behind Giggy, while Markus Miller (83), Colton Marchant (86) and Zachary Chastain (96) rounded out the team’s scorecard. ### It was Titus’ day that stood out the most to Warriors coach Jeff Marchant. For a team to win the sectional, each member needs to step up. Titus did that better than anyone Friday. ### “I think he had his best outing of the season (Friday),” Marchant said. “He’s had a tough season. He’s struggled quite a bit, but today he really came through for the team.” ### Entering the day as the No. 1 seeded team, Marchant admitted his Warriors entered the meet expecting to win. Westview returned every member of a team that performed well last year, but has grown into a consistent and mature top five in 2019. ### “Our first meet at the East Noble Invite we shot a 325, so we’ve been really steady all year long,” Marchant said. “These guys faced some adversity today with the course, but they handled it and showed some of what they can do.” ### Taking home the first title in nearly two decades was nice, of course, but Friday’s results obviously left Westview eyeing more. ### “Everything,” was the answer Marchant gave when asked what his team needs to focus on heading into Thursday’s Plymouth Regional at Swan Lake. Giggy echoed the same thoughts. ### The win is great. It feels nice. But this team still wants so much more. ### “We just need to improve our scoring across the board,” Giggy said. “We played that course last weekend in a tournament, and we didn’t do too well. But hopefully with that experience under our belt we can perform better this time. ### “Our goal is to go to regional, perform well and make the state meet.” ### West Noble placed eighth in the meet finishing with a team score of 366, with Prairie Heights (405) finishing 10th and Lakeland (430) 12th. ### Brayden Bohde’s 89 led the Chargers. He was followed by Joel Mast (90), Brockton Miller (92) and Andrew Ritchie (95). ### For Prairie Heights, Matt Kumfer’s 90 paced the Panthers, as the only golfer to break 100 on the scorecard. Quintin Ross (102), Cameron Sailor (104), Collin Keeslar (109) and Mason Lake (112) also scored. ### Bayley Iddings’ 97 led the Lakers, while Carson Aldrich (105), Luke Franke (109), Quinnlin Raber (119) and Rylee Porter (130) followed.",60119,1,"“ We just need to improve our scoring across the board,” Giggy said. “ We played that course last weekend in a tournament, and we didn’t do too well.

Great defense by both teams, good pitching... How many times do you see a 1-0 score in a game like this?” ### But DePoorta’s catch was the play of the year for the Maroons. ### “I didn’t feel the fence, but I knew I was close to it,” a smiling DePoorter said. “I just went back, stuck the glove out and made the catch. ### “I just wanted to do what I could to help my team win the game.” ### The win lifts the Maroons (25-12) into the Normal super-sectional Monday at the same Marie Kneer Stadium, where they will take on Joliet West, which defeated Lockport 6-5 to win the Thornwood sectional Friday. ### O’Fallon (25-10), meanwhile, ends its season thinking about what about what could have been.

But when Olivia Sanders drove a run-scoring single to right field in the sixth inning, the Maroons were three outs away from a sectional championship. ### Vande Voorde, who re-entered the game on the mound with two outs in the sixth inning, was aided in the seventh inning by a superb play by second baseman Olivia Sanders.

65830,"Zimbabwe to print own version of US dollar bill ### September 15, 2016 ### Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Email ### The governor of Zimbabwe’s central bank said it will begin issuing its own version of the US dollar bill. The cash-strapped country will start using the bond notes in October, and expects $75 million to be in circulation by the end of the year. ### Zimbabwe is a multicurrency country since it stopped printing its own money, the Zimbabwe dollar, in 2009 due to hyperinflation.

Greg Abbott, his office told a newspaper Friday. ### The Dallas Morning News reported that David Whitley's new job as a special adviser will pay him a salary of $205,000. ### Whitley served less than six months as secretary of state. He stepped down Monday as it became clear that Democrats in the Texas Legislature would deny him the confirmation vote needed to continue serving. ### Whitley is a longtime Abbott aide who had previously been his deputy chief of staff before the governor picked him in December to become the state's chief election officer. ### ""David Whitley has been an exemplary public servant to the state of Texas for many years and the Governor is proud to welcome him back to our organization as a Special Advisor,"" Wittman told the newspaper. ### Wittman did not return messages from The Associated Press on Friday. ### Whitley was in charge when the state wrongly questioned the U.S. citizenship of scores of voters without properly vetting a list of nearly 100,000 names. His office claimed that 58,000 of the voters flagged were shown to have voted in at least one election since 1996, prompting President Donald Trump to renew unsubstantiated claims of rampant voter fraud. ### In April, Texas settled a federal lawsuit over the botched search that required the state to pay $450,00 in fees to civil rights groups. ### News of Whitley getting a job back in Abbott's office drew swift criticism from opponents. ### ""In the Abbott Administration, being incompetent and malicious gets you a cushy new gig with a fancy job title. In the rest of the world, it gets you fired,"" said Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Actor Kevin Spacey is accused of groping the teenage son of a former Boston TV anchor in the restaurant's crowded bar in 2016. On Thursday, May 30, Nantucket District Court Judge Thomas Barrett ruled that the restaurant must hand over any surveillance footage taken there on the night in question. ### Rodrique Ngowi ### Save ### BOSTON (AP) — The man who accused Kevin Spacey of groping him at a bar in 2016 deleted text messages that would support Spacey's claims of innocence, the actor's lawyer said in court documents filed Friday. ### Defense attorney Alan Jackson is urging the court to order prosecutors to hand over a ""complete and unaltered"" forensic copy of the accuser's cellphone. He is also accusing prosecutors of trying to conceal that they had been in possession of the man's cellphone since November 2017. ### ""Newly produced evidence confirms"" that the accuser ""deleted exculpatory text messages and provided falsified screenshots of his conversation from the night in question to law enforcement,"" Jackson wrote. ### The accuser ""has gone to great lengths to remove text messages he believes did not fit his narrative. The prosecution is aware of this and hid that information from the defense,"" Jackson wrote. ### An attorney for Spacey's accuser declined to comment. ### Spacey pleaded not guilty in January to a charge of indecent assault and battery. His lawyers have called the accusation ""patently false."" ### It's the only criminal case that has been brought against the 59-year-old Oscar winner since his career fell apart amid a flurry of sexual misconduct allegations in 2017. ### The case first came to light that year when former Boston TV anchor Heather Unruh said Spacey got her son drunk and sexually assaulted him at Nantucket island's Club Car restaurant and bar, where the teen worked as a busboy. ### Spacey's attorney says it appears the accuser deleted certain messages between him and his then-girlfriend from his phone before sending screenshots of conversations to an officer investigating the case back in November 2017. ### Messages from a screenshot of a group text between the accuser and several of his friends that was sent to the officer have not been turned over to the defense, Jackson says. ### Spacey's lawyer is also challenging the impartiality of the district attorney's office after a top prosecutor in the office disclosed that his sister is friends with Unruh. Jackson is asking for all communications made about the case by First Assistant District Attorney Michael Trudeau, who said his sister shared a ski house with Unruh for years. ### ""The prosecution's bias and apparent advocacy for the complaining witness, rather than the evenhanded pursuit of justice, is perhaps best evidenced by the Commonwealth's decision to withhold"" the accuser's cellphone information, Jackson wrote. ### Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe told The Boston Globe that he hadn't read the filings and couldn't comment on Jackson's allegations. ### ""If the defendant wasn't who he is, no one would care about this case,"" O'Keefe told the newspaper. ### A spokeswoman for the prosecutors' office said it asked Spacey's lawyers to agree to a protective order because of privacy concerns before turning over data downloaded from the accuser's cellphone, but the defense has not yet done so. ### Another pretrial hearing in Spacey's case is scheduled for Monday. The judge has ordered the Club Car by Monday to turn over any surveillance footage taken the night the man says Spacey groped him. ### ——— ### Follow Alanna Durkin Richer at http://www.twitter.com/aedurkinricher ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

One of the newest trailways in the community is located in The Cliffs village. (Summerlin) ### Today is National Trails Day, something residents of the master-planned community of Summerlin know a lot about. ### In fact, the community’s extensive, 150-mile long trail system consistently ranks in resident surveys as the most popular and beloved outdoor amenity, earning The Howard Hughes Corp., Summerlin’s developer, with the American Trails Developer Award in 2008 from American Trails, a national nonprofit dedicated to trail interests. The award recognizes developers who establish quality, well-designed, multiuse trails systems within private developments and is the only award of its kind in the nation. ### In 2015, Summerlin received top national honors in the form of a gold award for Best Landscape Design from the National Association of Homebuilders — yet another confirmation of the enduring appeal of trails and their important role in the community’s landscape. ### According to Julie Cleaver, senior vice president of planning and design for Summerlin, trails are a Summerlin hallmark from both an aesthetic and lifestyle perspective. ### “From the beginning, trails were planned as a way to keep the community and its residents connected,” Cleaver said. ### “Popular with walkers, runners and strollers, the community’s trail system is easily the most heavily used amenity because it appeals to residents of all ages and interests. And given the prominence of trails in the Summerlin landscape, they have become synonymous with the community.” ### Summerlin’s trail system not only promotes healthy, outdoor activity like walking, running, cycling and strolling, it serves to better link the community and encourage social interaction. The trail system physically links villages, neighborhoods, parks and shopping centers — providing residents with direct access to their community. Bumping into neighbors and friends along the Summerlin Trail is an everyday occurrence for users. ### The Summerlin Trail System is comprised of four kinds of trails. Landscaped and lighted street-side trails ideal for walking, jogging and strolling are the backbone of the system and are a community hallmark. Village trails are often located in natural arroyos and man-made open spaces and are designed to provide respite from noise and traffic for long-distance runners. ### Regional trails are part of the proposed valleywide trail system for multiple, nonmotorized uses. They provide a link to Bureau of Land Management land in Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area and are constructed as public/private partnerships by Clark County and the city of Las Vegas in cooperation with The Howard Hughes Corp. ### Finally, natural trails exist within undeveloped areas of Summerlin and will eventually connect to more than 2,000 miles of planned regional trails throughout the valley. They are intended for use by outdoor and hiking enthusiasts. ### The Summerlin Trail System is a model of efficient planning, design and public and private partnership, Cleaver said. ### “It helps to define the community’s active lifestyle evident in the thousands of residents who use it every day,” she said.",60119,1,"In fact, the community’s extensive, 150-mile long trail system consistently ranks in resident surveys as the most popular and beloved outdoor amenity, earning The Howard Hughes Corp., Summerlin’s developer, with the American Trails Developer Award in 2008 from American Trails, a national nonprofit dedicated to trail interests.

File photograph: Niall Carson/PA Wire ###  ###  ###  ### Ian Bailey has said he wants a person or persons to come forward and tell the truth about the circumstances of Sophie Toscan du Plantier’s killing in 1996, after his conviction this week of her murder in Paris. ### The former journalist on Saturday told RTÉ he wanted “somebody in Ireland to come out and have the courage to tell the truth and admit they know it wasn’t me”. ### On Friday, Mr Bailey (62), of the Prairie Liscaha , Schull , Co Cork , was convicted in his absence by the three judges of the Cour d’Assises of Paris of the voluntary homicide of mother of one, Ms Toscan du Plantier (39) at her holiday home in Toormore , west Cork, on December 23rd, 1996. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. ### The English man has repeatedly denied any involvement in the killing, and refused to attend the trial in Paris. ### The court also ordered a new European arrest warrant to be issued, asking Ireland for the third time to extradite Mr Bailey to France . ### Mr Bailey described as “water off a duck’s back” his conviction in the French court for the murder, more than two decades after Ms Toscan du Plantier’s badly beaten body was found. ### “It was water of a duck’s back to be honest, but there we are,” he said about learning of the verdict and sentence handed down in the French capital’s high criminal court on Friday. ### Evidence against Bailey ‘overwhelming’, Paris court hears ### At a farmers’ market in Schull, west Cork, where he usually operates a stall, he suggested he might be expecting a knock on the door from authorities next week, after the court ordered the new European arrest warrant. ### “It is a bank holiday weekend,” he said. “Tomorrow is Sunday, it is a bank holiday on Monday. Maybe on Tuesday I might be waiting for a knock on my door.” ### Asked how he was feeling, he replied: “Tá mé go maith – I’m actually pretty good. I’m surprised this morning. I’m under strict instructions not to make any comment.” ### The Palais de Justice de Paris, where Ian Bailey was this week convicted of the 1996 murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier. Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA Wire ### Mr Bailey told RTÉ news he had written a poem – “a sort of mantra and a poem” – to “stay calm in the eye of the hurricane and that’s what I’ve been doing all week”. ### Eye of the hurricane ### “Actually I decided this morning when I woke up, because the hurricane moves on – this is a metaphor and I’m a poet – I am just going to remain in the eye of the hurricane… in the sense of peace,” he added. ### Mr Bailey said although he was at the farmers’ market as usual, he was not manning his stall “because I am a seasoned marketeer and doing a market while ‘tá sé fliuch’ [it is wet] is not much fun.

33789,"/ ### By Charles Hugh Smith ### The dark pool of parasitic scum known as the stock market is an “attractive nuisance” that should be shut down. ### In tort law, an  attractive nuisance  is any potentially hazardous object or condition that is likely to attract the naive and unwary, i.e. children. ### A classic example is an abandoned swimming pool half-filled with fetid water. ### Since many stock market investors are demonstrably naive about the risks and unwary of the dangers posed by the stock market (the proof of this is that they remain invested in the market), it is but a slight extrapolation of the attractive nuisance doctrine to declarethe stock market is clearly an “attractive nuisance” and should be closed immediately. ### Is this really a legal stretch? Consider the conditions that characterize an attractive nuisance. I have edited these to pertain to the stock market and investors: ### 1. The market is one in which the Powers That Be (the exchanges, the Central State, the central bank, et al., the effective “owners” of the stock market) know or have reason to know that brainwashed or ill-informed investors are likely to risk their money in. ### 2. The market is one of which the Powers That Be know or have reason to know (and fully realize or should realize) will involve an unreasonable risk of financial loss or ruin to such investors. ### 3. The investors, because of their consumption of officially sanctioned propaganda and misrepresentation of market risk and return, do not discover or realize the risk involved in placing money in the stock market. ### 4. The utility to the Powers That Be of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight compared to the risk borne by investors. ### 5. The Powers That Be fail to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the risk or otherwise protect the investors from potentially catastrophic financial loss. ### Can any reasonable person deny that the rigged, manipulated U.S. stock market is nothing but a predatory skimming operation that is increasingly at risk of systemic failure? If you have any doubts about the true nature of the American stock market , please read the new book  Dark Pools: High-Speed Traders, A.I. Bandits, and the Threat to the Global Financial System  (print edition)    (Kindle edition)  by financial reporter Scott Patterson. ### Today’s stock market has as much in common with the market of the 1960s as a horse-drawn carriage has with a Formula 1 race car. Most of the trading on the market is done by computers that hold shares for perhaps 11 seconds before skimming a slice from investors who lack the high-speed data flows from the exchanges, warp-speed processing power and sophisticated algorithms. ### Another huge chunk of market-moving activity is officially sanctioned manipulation by the Federal Reserve (the privately owned central bank of the U.S.) and Central State agents: the “fat finger” leaps at day’s end, the “stick saves” whenever gravity threatens to topple the corrupted market, and all the other interventions that are obvious to every active trader. ### In effect, the stock market has become an officially sanctioned  bucket shop  where “ownership” of shares has been rendered meaningless. The market exists for two reasons: 1) to skim low-risk profits from naive/brainwashed investors and 2) as a propaganda front that can be lofted ever higher by authorities for the purposes of managing perceptions, i.e. the market is higher, so the economy is doing great, never mind what your own eyes and experience are telling you. ### The stock market is demonstrably an “attractive nuisance” and should be closed immediately. It should never be reopened unless these conditions can be met: 1) All shares must be owned for at least four hours 2) All trading must be executed by humans on a transparent exchange where all trading activity (and open orders) is visible to all participants 3) Intervention in the market by the Federal Reserve or any Central State agency or agents is against the law. ### If you insist on putting money at risk in the stock market, be aware that you are playing a rigged roulette wheel and thus you are a mark. You might win, or the entire game might collapse in a rotten heap of lies and corruption. Just remember that the market is ruled by parasites who need to keep their hosts (investors) alive so they can continue to feed off them (i.e. biotrophic parasites). ### If the hosts all leave the market, the parasites will have only themselves to feed on, and they will quickly expire. ### Read the Introduction (2,600 words) and Chapter One (7,600 words)  for free.

We cannot know which of the State’s fast-rising debts and obligations will be renounced; we only know they will be renounced in one fashion or another. ### The process of the unsustainable collapsing and a new, more sustainable model emerging is called revolution.Rather than being powerless, we hold the fundamental building blocks of power. We need neither permission nor political change to liberate ourselves. A powerless individual becomes powerful when he renounces the lies and complicity that enable the doomed Status Quo’s dominance.",60119,1,"If you insist on putting money at risk in the stock market, be aware that you are playing a rigged roulette wheel and thus you are a mark.

79768,"15 ### (Van Tine Dennis/Sipa USA USA/Newscom) ### Rape cases have gone underreported in New York City because of a glaring omission by the New York City Police Department (NYPD). ### Newsy, the Center for Investigative Reporting, and ProPublica have been investigating law enforcement departments all across the country to find flaws in crime reporting. Their  project has already found several cities where rape cases are prematurely closed, allowing them to enjoy artificially high clearance rates. Among them : Wichita, Oakland, Baltimore, and Austin. ### The most recent findings focus on an overly narrow definition of rape, which has led to a 38 percent discrepancy between the NYPD's rape reports and those of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ### In 2012, the Department of Justice expanded the definition of forcible rape to cover any ""penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim."" The previous definition, which had been in place since 1927, only considered penile penetration of the vagina. The new definition is more favorable to victims of all genders and assault situations. ### Several months later, the NYPD's leadership sent out a memo  announcing that the department would update its definition in compliance with the new federal understanding. But in the seven years that have passed since then, the NYPD's crime-tracking system, CompStat, has failed to update its definition. ### As a result, acts that are now recognized as rape are merely classified—and investigated—as ""criminal sexual activity."" The NYPD ended up underreporting the crime by 38 percent. ### During an appearance this morning  on WNYC, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the NYPD would update its CompStat website to reflect the federal definition ""later this year.""",60119,1,"In 2012, the Department of Justice expanded the definition of forcible rape to cover any ""penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.

The violence raging once again in the northwestern province of Idlib, Syria's last rebel-held bastion, is putting Turkish-Russian relations to the test. ### Alexei Nikolsky ### Save ### ISTANBUL (AP) — Ankara and Moscow are again facing an escalation of violence in Syria's last rebel-held territory, a development that puts their cooperation to the test even as they support opposing sides in the eight-year war that has devastated Syria. ### An all-out offensive by Syrian government forces to capture Idlib in northwestern Syria from insurgents could unleash an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, for the area is home to 3 million people. ### Turkey, which is already hosting more than 3.6 million Syrian refugees, is facing strong pressure from Syria, Iran and Russia to deliver on its pledge to control the armed rebel factions in Idlib. ### But Turkey also needs Russia to rein in Syrian President Bashar Assad to prevent a massive outflow of refugees and to keep Turkish soldiers on the ground safe. ### Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin ""have an incentive to cooperate and ensure that nobody's interests are totally trampled,"" says Aaron Stein, the director of the Middle East program in American think-tank Foreign Policy Research Institute. ### In September, the two leaders brokered a cease-fire for Idlib in the Russian resort of Sochi, preventing a bloody onslaught, despite the fact that Russia has firmly backed Assad and Turkey supports opposition forces. Nine months later, the truce has failed. ### The agreement called for a 15-to-20 kilometer (9-to-12 mile) demilitarized zone free of insurgents and heavy weaponry and for two key highways crossing through Idlib to be reopened. The demilitarized zone has been breached and the highways are at the center of the current government offensive. ### Syrian ground forces have been advancing from the south of the rebel stronghold under the cover of Syrian and Russian airstrikes. ### The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said more than 291 civilians and 369 fighters have been killed since April 30 in the rebel stronghold. In the same period, 269 government troops and 22 civilians were killed in government areas by rebel fire. The U.N.'s children's agency said more than 130 children have reportedly been killed. ### Already, more than 200,000 people from the stronghold have been displaced, according to the U.N., with some seeking safety near the border with Turkey while others crammed into already crowded camps in Syria. ### Turkey has accused the Syrian government of violating the cease-fire and Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said the country has told Russia ""the regime must be controlled."" ### Russia has launched airstrikes in Idlib and is providing air cover in the Syrian government offensive. It has complained that the militants have increasingly been targeting its military base in the nearby coastal province of Latakia. ### But for now, Moscow is unlikely to support an all-out Syrian operation in Idlib because the benefits of a long-term alliance with Turkey outweigh one military battle. ### ""Russia doesn't want to ruin its relationship with Turkey because of Idlib,"" says Kirill Semenov, a Moscow-based Middle East analyst and expert at the Russian International Affairs Council. ### In late April, Putin said he would not rule out a large-scale assault but ""together with our Syrian friends, we believe that this would not be advisable"" due to humanitarian issues. ### Still, Russia's patience is wearing thin with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which it accuses of targeting its military base. HTS is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Russia and Turkey, despite its claims it has disassociated from al-Qaida. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### Top Russian officials have often called Idlib a ""breeding ground for terrorists."" ### Despite the cease-fire deal, Turkey has been unable to neutralize the extremists. Much of Idlib has come under the control of HTS, which has defeated Turkey-backed armed groups. ### Emre Ersan, an associate professor of international relations and political science at Istanbul's Marmara University, believes Turkey may have overestimated its influence over HTS. He says Turkey's plan to split the group, with some of its members joining Turkish-backed opposition forces and the group's hard-liners isolated, has not worked. ### Instead of coming under the umbrella of moderate groups, HTS has used Turkey as leverage against Russia and Assad-supporter Iran, according to Ersan. ### Subscribe to Breaking News ### Sign up!  ### Adding to the risks, Turkish troops are in the line of fire. Two Turkish soldiers were wounded in early May in a Syrian government artillery attack on an observation post. Three other attacks have been cited by Turkey's official Anadolu Agency, raising the question if the attacks were accidental or designed to pressure Ankara with Russia's knowledge. ### ""The Turkish Armed Forces will not take a single step back from where it is,"" Akar, Turkey's defense minister, said last week. ### Erdogan and Putin have talked on the phone, agreeing to continue working along the lines of the cease-fire agreement to prevent civilian deaths and a refugee flow. They also agreed to meet on the sidelines of next month's Group of 20 conference in Japan. ### ""Apart from this dialogue and cooperation, there is nothing on the ground that can prevent a catastrophe in Idlib,"" Ersan says. ### The presidents have become close since 2016, rebuilding their relations after a dramatic crisis in 2015 when Turkey shot down a Russian jet near the Syrian border. Their rapport comes amid Turkey's fragile relations with NATO ally United States, especially over Washington's support of Syrian Kurdish-led forces who control large swaths in eastern Syria. Ankara considers them an extension of a Kurdish insurgency operating inside Turkey. ### Erdogan is so far sticking to his promise to buy Russian-made S-400 missiles despite U.S. warnings the system would jeopardize Turkey's participation in the F-35 fighter jet program and compromise its safety. Stein calls this ""a big win for Russia."" Turkey is angling for a way to have both the S-400s and the F-35s. ### Turkey is also talking with the U.S. about a safe zone in northeastern Syria and has repeatedly asked for the U.S. to end its military support for Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. Erdogan will meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the G-20 as well. ### Ersan believes Russia may allow Turkey to grab the northern town of Tel Rifaat from the Kurdish fighters, the last town they control in western Syria. Russian support could help Turkey put pressure on the SDF, widen Turkish influence and strengthen its hand in ongoing negotiations with the U.S. ### In exchange, he argues, Turkey could be open to some limited Syrian operation toward Idlib. ### —",60119,1,"The agreement called for a 15-to-20 kilometer (9-to-12 mile) demilitarized zone free of insurgents and heavy weaponry and for two key highways crossing through Idlib to be reopened.

The sheer number of affected people listed in the lawsuit is expected to draw out court proceedings. ### D&SNG owner Al Harper attended Friday’s court hearing. ### Earlier this year, the court ordered documents associated with the case to be suppressed , meaning only lawyers and the court may view them. As a result, many of the case filings are not public. ### More than 26 affected parties are listed in the lawsuit who seek compensation for damages as a result of the 416 Fire. Most of those damages are the result of floods from the burn area, though a few people are seeking compensation for fire damage to their property. ### Also, a handful of businesses joined the litigation, arguing they lost sales during the 416 Fire, which lasted nearly two months, caused thousands of evacuations, closed public lands and highways, and blanketed the region in smoke most mornings through June. ### Carlson acknowledged other parties may join the lawsuit before the trial, but she was adamant it would not push back the September 2020 start date. ### “We’re not going to be continuing the case for that to happen,” she said. ### jromeo@durangoherald.com",60119,1,"Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.###17% chance of precipitation###Partly cloudy in the morning.###7% chance of precipitation###Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.###15% chance of precipitation","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]","<p>Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.</p><p>17% chance of precipitation</p><p>Partly cloudy in the morning.</p><p>7% chance of precipitation</p><p>Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.</p><p>15% chance of precipitation</p>",968

AP ### facebook shares ### SHARE ### In the past few weeks, the three million civilians trapped in the Syrian province of Idlib have been subjected to a savage bombardment from the skies. Buttressed by his Russian backers, Syrian President Bashar Al Assad claims he is attacking extremists, chiefly Hayat Tahrir Al Sham, who control the enclave. However, this is a more cynical campaign to conquer the final bastion of rebel control – and Mr Al Assad will not rest until it is decimated. ### While there are extremist elements operating in Idlib after rebel fighters refused to hand over weapons, most of its population – including one million children – are innocent civilians, already battered by eight years of war. Millions were bussed there from other rebel enclaves and now find themselves in a holding pen. To understand the morally bankrupt Assad regime, consider reports that bombs are falling during iftar as long-suffering residents break their fast. ### There are chilling parallels with Aleppo, which suffered a similar fate before it returned to regime control in 2016. In the bloody process, thousands were killed. In Idlib, schools and hospitals are thought to have been deliberately targeted, killing at least 160 and displacing more than 300,000 people, compounding what was already a humanitarian crisis. ### Given that the fall of Idlib would effectively seal victory for Mr Al Assad in what has been an eight-year civil war, this campaign was both predictable and preventable. An all-out assault was previously thwarted by a Russia-Turkey-brokered ceasefire, which now appears to be crumbling. This is typical of the Syrian president, who has repeatedly employed a “starve or surrender” policy. And yet, with Russia vetoing any action, the United Nations Security Council has proven itself incapable of alleviating the plight of Idlib’s besieged millions. ### There has been a complete failure to protect the young and the helpless, despite empty promises of action from the international community when red lines are crossed. As Ursula Mueller, UN assistant secretary general for humanitarian affairs, said last week: “Is there nothing to be said or done when barrel bombs are indiscriminately dropped in civilian areas?” The answer is clear in Idlib. The world has simply turned to look the other way. ### Updated: June 1, 2019 06:03 PM",60119,1,"SHARE###In the past few weeks, the three million civilians trapped in the Syrian province of Idlib have been subjected to a savage bombardment from the skies.

39604,"By Ted on June 2, 2019 in Featured , General , Highlight ### By Theodore Shoebat ### The government of Italy just revoked Steve Bannon’s right to use an ancient monastery as a headquarters to conspire a nationalist uprising in Europe. According to a report from Vox : ### Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon’s plans for a far-right nationalist school have been halted by Italian authorities. Bannon hoped to run the school out of an ancient monastery near Rome, but officials say they are revoking rights to the grounds for failure to maintain the site and pay fees. ### In a statement released Friday, Gianluca Vacca, an official with Italy’s cultural ministry, said that it  was the government’s “duty” to revoke the rights  to the Certosa de Trisulti monastery that the Human Dignity Institute, a far-right Catholic think tank that Bannon partnered with, had obtained. Vacca cited the fact the group failed to pay proper concessions and said it was determined that the institute did not have any experience in cultural heritage custodianship. The ministry also voiced concerns that repairs had not begun that would make the historic property available for public use. ### “Political opinions have nothing to do with us,” Vacca said. “We are interested in respecting the law and protecting the national cultural heritage, of which the Certosa is obviously part.” ### Bannon, who once served as President Trump’s chief strategist, had  hoped to train mid-career students  “looking to do something different” in the rhetoric and strategy of far-right nationalism at the school. He promised the monastery would become a “gladiator school” and planned to call it the “Academy for the Judaeo-Christian West.” ### In response to the Italian government’s statement, Bannon signaled that he is not ready to give up on his dream of opening the school and  said , “The fight for Trisulti is a microcosm of the fight for the Judeo-Christian West.” ### No, this has nothing to do with fighting for Christianity, and everything to do with conspiring for a tribalist and ultra-nationalist surge in Europe. That he describes his school as one for political “gladiators” makes one reminisce on the Operation Gladio, (which was being done by NATO to spark nationalism in Europe) an Italian word meaning “sword” which is the root word for “gladiator“ (swordsman). ### Steve Bannon is praised and revered as a savior figure for the West against Islamic immigration. While the cult lives on, what his followers do not know — or do not want to know — is that Bannon is really a globalist lobbying not just for European nationalism, but also for nationalism in Islamist Pakistan. Bannon is also lobbying for Viktor Orban of Hungary while Orban is currently collaborating with Turkey to strengthen Hungary’s military. Lets first deal with Hungary and then we will discuss Bannon and how he is a part of a global conspiracy to spark nationalism. ### We warned of a rising Turkish-Hungarian alliance. And we are today seeing this collaborating materializing, rhyming with history when Hungary was an ally with the Ottoman Empire during World War One (more on this later). ### Hungary will be boosting its military capacity at a substantial level, and Turkey will be a major player in the upgrading of the Hungarian military. As we read in one report from Hungarian Spectrum : ### “We know little about the conversation that took place between Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Viktor Orbán during the Turkish prime minister’s visit to Budapest a few days ago, but in the joint press conference Orbán talked about improving the Hungarian armed forces with Turkish participation. He explained that because of the poor economic conditions he faced in 2010, he was forced to curtail military spending, but now the Hungarian army is on track for a major upgrade. He intends for Turkey to play a major role in this endeavor. He added that Hungary is planning to embark on developing a robust armament industry with Turkish help.” ### Orban also stressed that Turkey is essential for controlling illegal immigration in Europe and for strengthening Hungary’s military. As we read in a report from Hungary Today : ### “Hungarian security and Turkish stability are directly linked, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said after talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Budapest on Monday. “A stable Turkish government and a stable Turkey are a precondition for Hungary not to be endangered in any way due to overland migration,” Orbán said at a joint press conference after the talks. ### It is Hungary’s interest that Turkey should remain strong and able to maintain peace in its region and control illegal migration to Europe, Orbán said. ### Orbán expressed appreciation to Turkey for accommodating several million refugees that arrived via neighbouring countries and thanked the Erdogan for “fully meeting” Turkey’s agreement with the European Union, which he said was another precondition for European security. ### On another subject, Orbán said that Hungary and Turkey would raise the level of military cooperation and build “powerful ties” in the military industry. He added that in recent decades “there have been no money or energy left to develop the military” but “we will make up for that now; Hungary’s goal is to build a modern and effective national army”.” ### Orban also talked about major Turkish investments, worth over a half a billion dollars, being done in Hungary. As Xinhua Press writes : ### “Talks are underway regarding Turkish investments in Hungary worth 500 million U.S. dollars, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Tuesday. ### “Currently, negotiations about eight Turkish projects are underway, and hopefully the result of these will be an investment package worth half a billion dollars,” Orban told a Hungarian-Turkish business forum held during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to Budapest.” ### Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan also praised the cooperation being conducted by Hungary and Turkey. As we read from the Hurriyet Daily News : ### Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Oct. 9 praised cooperation between Ankara and Budapest, describing it as “exemplary.” ### ““We are working hard mutually with Hungary, with which we have deep and rooted ties, to improve our cooperation,” Erdoğan wrote on Twitter, following his two-day official visit to the country. ### “Our cooperation with Hungary within the scope of international organizations such as NATO, the Council of Europe and the European Union is exemplary,” Erdoğan added. ### Erdoğan said relations between the two countries boosted after a high-level strategic cooperation council was established in 2013. ### The bilateral trade volume between the two countries climbed to $ 2.6 billion in 2017, he added. ### “We will move forward with concrete steps to reach $5 billion trade volume,” Erdoğan added.” ### Why is Hungary collaborating with Turkey, when for years we have been told by right-wing claptrap fantasizers that Orban was the great hope of the West? The protest against “illegal immigration” and “the flood of Muslim migrants into the West” is a big show for the hopeful dreamers who easily fall prey to propaganda and are anxiously waiting for “a hero” to save “Western civilization”; this is being done as a distraction from the real conspiracy, and that is the use of Muslim immigration as a way to spark European nationalism à la Operation Gladio (a CIA operation that planned to use terrorism as a means to igniting nationalism in Western Europe). Notice what Orban did: he thanked Turkey for impeding Islamic migration. ### Well, when Germany and Turkey collaborated to bring in the Islamic migrants it was Turkey who absorbed the majority of these migrants. There was a “Muslim migrant crises,” and Turkey acted as the main solution to this “crises,” which gives politicians like Orban the green light to praise Turkey and further conspire with him. Turkey is an international powerhouse that maintains one of the largest militaries in the globe (thanks to Operation Gladio under which the US made Turkey one of the most armed countries in NATO). Hungary, on the other hand, is a lot poorer than Turkey. Turkey’s GDP is over eight times the GDP of Hungary. Thus, Hungary would need a country like Turkey to collaborate with in order to strengthen its military. ### Moreover, let us not forget that Hungary was an ally of the Ottoman Empire during World War One in their fight against the Russians. Hungary was at the time part of the Dual Monarchy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and thus a member of the Axis of which the Ottoman Empire was also a member. So, there is an historical precedent behind Hungary’s collaboration with Turkey. There is also a sense of ethnic kinship that Hungary has with Turkey. Both of the countries’ main demographic are a mixture of Turkic (Hungary was invaded by Turkic Huns and Turkey by Turkic Seljuks from Central Asia) and Indo-European peoples. Orban has, numerous times, made mention of the ethnic similarity between Hungary and Turkey, because he is a pan-Turanian, or an ethno-nationalist for the Turkic races. Last year, on September of 2017, we warned about the coming Hungarian-Turkish alliance and wrote how pan-Turanianism would be the underlying ideology behind it. ### In June of 2017, Viktor Orban delivered a speech at the Hungarian-Turkish Business Forum in Ankara, to talk about the importance of relations between Hungarian and Turkish industrialists. In his speech, Orban talked about both the racial relations and the need for deeper economic ties between Turkey and Hungary: ### “Turkey is in a good location, and although there are now wars on its borders, strategically it is in one of the world’s most important locations. It has an enormous private sector. Why should it pay any attention to the Hungarians – aside from friendship and the intellectually intriguing question of common origins lost in the mists of ancient history? Why should any member of its business community divert their gaze to Hungary? I believe that there is one fact which even the most successful Turkish businesspeople would be wise to consider: Hungary is a country of ten million, and we are capable of generating exports worth 110 billion dollars; meanwhile Turkey is a country of eighty million, which is capable of generating exports worth 145 billion dollars.” ### Later in the speech Orban again brought up a common racial origin between Hungarians and Turks: ### “To sum up, we have the legend of common Turkish-Hungarian origins. We have mutual respect. We have an outstanding political and personal relationship between the leaders of the two countries. We have an enormous Turkey and a strengthening Central Europe. And we have a Hungarian investment and business environment without rival in Europe.” ### In 2012, Orban described Hungary as “half-Asian” and stated that Hungarians are the type of people who will unite together only by force: ### “Cooperation is a question of force, not of intention. Perhaps there are countries where things don’t work that way, for example in the Scandinavian countries, but such a half-Asiatic rag-tag people as we are can unite only if there is force.” ### Orban has even stated that the Hungarians also have a racial and cultural relation with Japan. In a talk that he gave in the Suzuki building, he said: ### “Our clothes are slightly dingy, we are a little more disorganized, we have let ourselves go a bit in the past eight years, there are signs of decadence here and there, but we believed in the values on which your world is built, in honour, in diligence, in responsibility and in respect, and we can prove it. We, as members of the European Union, sail under western flag, but as you also know, we are an eastern nation, and for us, just as for you, the principal commandment is that every agreement has to be kept.” ### In 2012, in the National Economy of Hungary, Minister György Matolcsy, expressed this belief even further, stating: ### “We are proud of having come from Asia. On the bottom of our infants, in about 30 out of 100 cases, for six weeks there is a small red dot, just like in the case of Japanese babies. I have been told about this by Japanese scientists, I didn’t know before.[…] My point in mentioning this is just that sometimes others know more about us than we do. While talking with Chinese delegations many times a week, they all begin their talks saying that, well yes, between us there is some deep, deep, deep… maybe even kinship.” ### This interconnects with the pan-Asianism of Turkey; for the Young Turks declared Turkey to be the “Japan of the Near East” (I wrote an article on pan-Asianism which can be read here ). ### Stephan Bannon has been currently spending his time intensely lobbying for Orban and other nationalist parties in Europe where he is promoting “economic nationalism.” As we read in a report from Bloomberg : ### Former White House strategist Steve Bannon said that European states should abandon the euro over time and lauded nationalist leaders including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as “heroic.” ### So Bannon is lobbying for Orban who is working to collaborate with Turkey. Bannon is not cultivating some healthy patriotism, rather he is working to usher in the international world order of the Antichrist. ### Orban has also been backing Germany’s plan to create a pan-European military force which would be headed by the Germans . Orban stated : ### “We should list the issue of security as a priority, and we should start setting up a common European army” ### There are players who are using the fears of Europeans to generate consent for their own political agenda. They will speak about ‘defending European culture,’ or preserving the indigenous ‘White’ population in order to either stoke fears about an almost apocalyptic takeover. I call this white fright, or the use of fears that are amongst White populations for a particular political end. For example, the ethno-nationalist organization, American Renaissance, utilizes white fright and will point to legitimate concerns about terrorism, rape, etc. But, they will use these issues as a way to push their ultimate agenda, and that is eugenics, Darwinism and racism, as their own website declares eugenics to be “the obvious solution” and points to “embryo selection” as part of that solution: ### “Eugenics is the obvious solution, but it is notoriously difficult to accomplish. There have been a few attempts to pay intelligent people to have more children, but they have not been widely successful. It would be possible to pay people of less than average intelligence not to have children, but Prof. Lynn argued that no democratic nation would ever have the firmness of will to restrict reproduction by the unfit. ### Embryo selection—the fertilization of many of a woman’s eggs and implantation of the most promising—has the potential dramatically to raise intelligence, but Prof. Lynn predicted that the practice would be banned in the West for “moral” reasons.” ### White fright is a very real thing; and it is being used by politicians and armchair revolutionaries for very dangerous and insidious objectives. One of these armchair revolutionaries is Steve Bannon, the political strategist who helped to meme Trump’s way to the Whitehouse. While Hungary and Turkey collaborate, Bannon has been spending most of his conspiring time to lobby for Orban and other nationalist politicians in Europe. Just days ago, Bannon lobbied for Orban and “economic nationalism” and exhorted European governments to throw away the euro and return to their local currencies. ### Bannon is saying this in the capacity as a director of his pan-European nationalist organization, called “the Movement,” which is based in Brussels — the same city where the Counterjihad was solidified as an international movement by Filip DeWinter and Christine Brim. The Movement was actually founded by a Jewish politician from Belgium named Mischael Modrikamen (which is not surprising since there are numerous Jews, from Pamela Geller to David Horowitz and Bob Shilman, who are backing European nationalism today). As we read in a report from Bloomberg: ### “Former White House strategist Steve Bannon said that European states should abandon the euro over time and lauded nationalist leaders including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as “heroic.” ### Bannon, one of the architects of Donald Trump’s presidential victory, said his support of “The Movement,” a Brussels-based organization promoting populist political groups, is aimed at turning the European Union back into a “collection of sovereign nations” rather than an economically and politically-integrated bloc. ### “I’m a huge believer that you should have control over your national currency,” Bannon said in an interview at the Bloomberg Invest summit in London on Wednesday. “I think it’s a fundamental part of economic nationalism.” ### Mischael Modrikamen ### We have been told that Bannon is about “putting America first.” Why then is he putting so much effort in Europe? Because its not about “Americans first,” but an agenda, an agenda of nationalism, of tribalism, of egoism and militarism, because that is exactly what this surge of nationalism is leading to. ### Nationalism is about domination. ### No group of power players do not take over a government and a society without  some sense of desire to make a name for themselves at the international level. Men with power want only more power, and this aspiration does not get satiated at a state appointed border. The unquenchable thirst for power knows no borders, and thus the preachers of the religion of national egoism seek to proselytize their faith throughout the world. ### A good example is Ukrainian nationalism. The Social National Assembly of Ukraine was a very strong and violent nationalist movement that partook in the Euromaidan revolution in 2014. One of its goals was to make Ukraine into a world superpower that would extend to the Balkans and the Caucasus. In the manifesto for the Social National Assembly it reads: “The ultimate goal of Ukraine’s foreign policy is world domination.” ### Expansionism was not just the goal of the Social National Assembly, but of another Ukrainian nationalist organization, the Ukrainian National Assembly — Ukrainian People’s Self-Defense (UNA-UPSD) which played a major role in fighting and attacking the police during the Euromaidan. The UNA actually showed their expansionist agenda when they attacked people outside of Ukraine. For example, in 1993 UNA fighters fought the Russians in the Georgia-Abkhazia conflict. In the fall of 1994 to 1995, UNA militiamen fought for the Chechen mujahideen and their leader, Dzhokhar Dudayev, against the Russians (See Byshock & Kochetkov, Neonazis & Euromaidan, pp. 108, 118). These militiamen called themselves nationalists, but they were fighting for the Chechen Muslim cause. What is this? Nationalism is a social-construct, a means by which to rile up the masses and get them to back up the agendas for the powers that be. ### Ukrainian nationalists ### Bannon himself admitted that his movement is not about just one country, but about a global movement. As we read in a report from Bloomberg, Bannon’s Movement: ### will cater to “populist, nationalist movements” rising in countries as far apart as Brazil and Pakistan. “It’s not just about the EU; it’s global in nature,” he said. ### Bannon does not want to limit his nationalist cult to the EU, but wants to go as far as the Muslim world, as we read in a report from the Independent: ### “He argues that nationalist and populist forces, in part inspired by Mr Trump, are poised to claim political power in capitals from Pakistan to Japan to Australia, Brazil and Colombia, and he stays in contact with all of them. … His crew acts as his road family – as security, schedulers and advisers on everything from how to contact Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan to the best backdrop for video interviews.” ### What type of nationalism would arise out of Pakistan? It would be an Islamist nationalism, given that that Islam is the main religion of the country. So, Bannon is working to revive nationalism in Europe, which would be ethno-nationalism, and to help drive nationalism in Pakistan, which would be of an Islamist nature, and also — quite obviously — of an anti-India sentiment. Bannon is not looking to ‘protect the white race,’ — he doesn’t give a fig about that — he, really, is pushing to usher in a global surge in militarist and national frenzy. Bannon is working with nationalists like Filip DeWinter, who is a Flemish ethno-nationalist and a Nazi.",60119,1,"Well, when Germany and Turkey collaborated to bring in the Islamic migrants it was Turkey who absorbed the majority of these migrants.

26273,"Associated Press ### PHILADELPHIA — ### It was late in a listless Eagles exhibition game on the cool and cloudy night of Aug. 23, 1984. In Veterans Stadium’s notorious 700 Level, the blood-alcohol level was as elevated as the vantage point. ### The home team, 5-11 the previous year, was displaying little improvement. Rowdy and restless, fans booed lustily after Philadelphia rookie Evan Cooper’s fumble, after two Ron Jaworski interceptions, after backup QB Joe Pisarcik was sacked twice. ### So when the giant PhanaVision screen suddenly flashed the image of two men in skimpy shorts and sleeveless, satin T-shirts, the crowd’s reaction was as predictable as the 6-9-1 Eagles season that was to follow. ### “There was even something new to boo this year,” The Inquirer’s Jere Longman noted in his story on the Eagles’ 20-19 victory over the Browns, “male cheerleaders.” ### Time, attitudes, and stadiums have changed. When the Eagles open their 2019 season, the debut of Kyle Tanguay, their first male cheerleader since then, figures to pass with little note. ### But 35 years ago, that first bracing glimpse of Paul Kramer and Mark Merschen, who that year joined 30 female counterparts on the Eagles’ Liberty Belles, drew a decidedly negative response. ### “I think it was an idea before its time,” Merschen said recently. ### Other NFL teams had employed male cheerleaders. The Eagles weren’t trying to foster social change when they did so and, according to some accounts, were so shaken by the Vet reception that they briefly considered shelving the experiment. ### Whatever triggered the crowd’s reaction, it was soon forgotten, and Kramer and Merschen — with a significant uniform adjustment — endured the entire 1984 season, performing at all eight regular-season home games and at public and charitable events throughout the area. ### A year later, Norman Braman bought the team from Leonard Tose. The Eagles’ cheerleading program was revamped, and Kramer and Merschen faded away. ### Kramer moved to New York City, where he taught in the public school system for many years. He died at 57 in 2012. Merschen was a professional roller skater when he tried out on a whim. He is 59 and single and works at Philadelphia International Airport as a fleet-service agent for American Airlines. ### Their role in franchise history was nearly forgotten until the Eagles’ May 1 hiring of Tanguay. When Kramer’s sister heard the news, she was annoyed that the Eagles had labeled the University of the Arts dance major their first male cheerleader. ### “I reached out to the Eagles, to media relations and the cheerleaders,” Terri Kramer-Mebert said. “Nobody contacted me. Finally, I sent Kyle a message about my brother.” ### Kramer grew up in Wallingford, one of five children of a Westinghouse engineer and his teacher wife. He would go on to earn a master’s in education from Fordham, but at the time was working with special-needs children in a Delaware County day care that his mother started. In the spring of 1984, on a dare, he responded to an ad about an Eagles cheerleader tryout. ### “He loved to dance,” Kramer-Mebert recalled. “We all took dance classes growing up. When we were clearing out my parents’ house, we found all these old top hats and tap shoes. Anyway, he made the first cut and he got excited about it, so he continued. It was tough, but he eventually got picked.” ### That same spring, Merschen, of Maple Glen, happened to be at JFK Stadium preparing for a roller-skating show. When rain postponed it, he and a fellow performer decided to walk across Pattison Avenue to the Vet, where they knew the Eagles were auditioning cheerleaders. ### “There was a woman in charge, and I asked her if it was open to guys,” Merschen said. “She said, ‘Sure, why not?’ So we just did some of our skating routines without skates. My friend, Tony, got cut, but I made it.” ### Initially, a few of the Belles were cool to their new male teammates but very soon, according to Sharon Sweeney, then their choreographer, “all the girls loved them.” ### Unlike the women, Kramer and Merschen didn’t have to carry pom-poms. And once they got past their trying debut, they abandoned the shorts — basically the same as the women were wearing — and donned Kelly green sweatpants. ### “But those two guys did everything that the girls did,” recalled Sweeney, who operates an Irish-themed gift shop in Phoenixville. “They were in the Thanksgiving Parade with us. They were at all the games and went to the softball games and supermarket openings.” ### Neither Merschen nor Sweeney remembers much booing at their debut, but there apparently was enough to make the Eagles reconsider their decision. ### “These guys are great,” Sherry Lewis, the Eagles’ cheerleading administrator, told the Daily News a few days later. “But if the reaction is more negative than positive, then that will be that.” ### Kramer-Mebert was at the game and hasn’t forgotten the reaction of the preseason crowd of 40,030 to the two men. ### “There were a lot of jeers,” she said. “The people sitting behind me were carrying on and calling them names. After a while, I couldn’t take it anymore and I stood up and said, ‘That’s my brother.’ I was proud of him. I stared at them all and sat down. Later, I turned around and they were gone. ### “Later, I asked Paul how it felt to hear all those comments and the boos,” she said. “I remember he said, ‘I can handle it because when we leave that stadium at night, what the girls have to hear from the people standing at the entrance is 10 times worse.’ ### “He was very proud of being an Eagles cheerleader.

The LightStrip Plus works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit. Here's another thing: it almost never goes on sale. Usually this kit, which comes with a 6-inch strip, retails for about $80, so you can really save thanks to this deal.

Under $100: Everyone's favorite kitchen gadget ### Find out what all the fuss is about. ### (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar) ### Here at Reviewed, we're kind of on a mission. Our motto? Never let anyone pay full price for an Instant Pot. Ever. ### When it comes to managing meals—especially during the work week and especially when you have kids—this multi-cooker is just a lifesaver. It goes on sale all the time, but not every version of it is worth buying. However, you can shop and save on two good versions of this handy gadget (which functions as a rice cooker, steamer, yogurt maker, and slow cooker in one) right now. Their most popular model, the  Instant Pot DUO60 7-in-1 , is on sale at Amazon for only $69.99, which is one of the lowest prices we've ever seen outside of Prime Day and Black Friday. Want an upgrade? Go with the  Instant Pot DUO Plus 60 9-in-1 , which you can grab for just $20 more, at $89.99.

Unless you've embraced the standing desk life, chances are you spend most of your time sitting, either at a desk or in traffic, or even just while watching TV or reading a book. What you might not realize is that it's actually doing a number on your body, and you can feel it, in the form of aches and pains and general discomfort. ### Massages can be a great way to relieve that pain, but they're expensive. That's what's so great about this full massage cushion, since it's designed to deliver a deep kneading massage and can help penetrate knots and release tension from all those problem areas. Even better? It's on sale for under $40 right now, thanks to an on-page coupon.

U.S. stocks tumbled on Wall Street in response to Trump's planned action. ### ""Imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico is exactly the wrong move,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is exploring legal action in response to the tariffs. ""These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border. Instead, Congress and the president need to work together to address the serious problems at the border."" ### Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador dispatched his foreign secretary to Washington to try to negotiate a solution. He said social problems are not solved with coercive measures, but also seemed convinced that Trump just needed to be informed about all the steps Mexico has taken to slow illegal migration. ### Mexico has stepped up raids on migrant caravans traveling through the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca this year. It has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more who wait endlessly for permits that would allow them to travel legally through Mexico. ### U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with his Mexican counterpart via telephone Friday, said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, who's traveling with Pompeo in Bern, Switzerland. Ortagus said the department doesn't comment on details of diplomatic conversations. ### ""We maintain an ongoing dialogue and close cooperation with Mexico on a wide range of issues, including border security efforts,"" she said. ""The United States and Mexico recognize that managing our shared border is a challenge common to both countries."" ### Administration officials told reporters in a briefing call Thursday evening that Mexico could prevent the tariffs from kicking in by securing its southern border with Guatemala, cracking down on criminal smuggling organizations, and entering into a ""safe third country agreement"" that would make it difficult for those who enter Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the U.S. ### ""We fully believe they have the ability to stop people coming in from their southern border and if they're able to do that, these tariffs will either not go into place or will be removed after they go into place,"" said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. ### Trump said the percentage will gradually increase — up to 25% — until the migration problem is remedied. ### ""Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades,"" Trump said in a tweet Friday. ""Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!"" ### Trump's decision showed the administration going to new lengths, and looking for new levers, to pressure Mexico to take action — even if those risk upending other policy priorities, like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal that is the cornerstone of Trump's legislative agenda and seen as beneficial to his reelection effort. ### Keeping the economy rolling also is critical to Trump's reelection, and business was not happy with the president's planned tariff on Mexican imports. ### ""These proposed tariffs would have devastating consequences on manufacturers in America and on American consumers,"" said Jay Timmons, chief executive officer of the National Association of Manufacturers. ""We have taken our concerns to the highest levels of the administration and strongly urge them to consider carefully the impact of this action on working families across this country."" ### The stock market's tumble on Friday all but guarantees that May will be the first monthly loss for the market in 2019. The news hit automakers particularly hard. Many of them import vehicles into the U.S. from Mexico. ### ""The auto sector — and the 10 million jobs it supports — relies upon the North American supply chain and cross border commerce to remain globally competitive,"" said the Auto Alliance, which represents automakers that built 70% of all cars and light trucks sold in U.S. ""Any barrier to the flow of commerce across the U.S.-Mexico border will have a cascading effect — harming U.S. consumers, threatening American jobs and investment and curtailing economic progress."" ### Some of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress opposed the tariff. Republican senators have made almost weekly treks to the White House to nudge the president off his trade wars, and this latest move sent them scrambling again to signal their displeasure in hopes of reversing Trump's actions. ### Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn supports the president's commitment to securing the border, an aide said, but he opposes the across-the-board tariff, ""which will disproportionately hurt Texas."" ### Key trade senators also spoke up. Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey, who has questioned the administration's ability to invoke national security threats for some other imports, called the tariffs a ""blanket tax increase"" on items Americans purchases from Mexico and ""the wrong remedy."" ### The tariff threat comes at a peculiar time, given how hard the administration has been pushing for passage of the USMCA, which would update the North American Free Trade Agreement. ### Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a usual Trump ally and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, slammed the president's action, saying it was a ""misuse of presidential tariff authority"" that would burden American consumers and ""seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA."" ### Sen.

82940,"Big NHL future for little Caufield ### Lance Hornby ### LinkedIn ### BUFFALO — Not long ago, Cole Caufield would have been ignored at the NHL Scouting Combine, or shooed away by security thinking he was a young punk autograph hound. ### But this week the 5-foot-7 American-born forward had 27 teams lined up to interview him for the June 21 draft in Vancouver, including six of seven Canadian clubs. With the trend toward scorers with smarts in traffic, he’s tabbed to be chosen anywhere from sixth to 13th in a number of mock drafts — once Jack Hughes, Kaapo Kakko and a few high-end centres go. ### Incoming Detroit general manager Steve Yzerman, picking sixth, is among those known to favour such diminutive dynamos. ### “Size is not a risk anymore,” declared Caufield from somewhere inside a massive media scrum on Saturday. “It came up in some meetings, but I wasn’t concerned about it. I just try to speak my mind and my confidence. I bring more speed to my game than (other) smaller guys. My strength is a big part of my game, too, pretty strong for my size. ### “If I was taller, I wouldn’t be the player I am today. It’s my ability to get lost (in crowds).” ### Caufield, who was born in Wisconsin, said all small fry owe a recent debt to Chicago’s Alex DeBrincat, who produced 69 goals his first two NHL seasons with similar dimensions. Caufield cited other productive smaller players such as Brendan Gallagher and Jonathan Marchessault. ### But Caufield also benefited greatly from the U.S. National Team Development Program (NTDP), which could graduate up to five picks in the top 10 this year, and perhaps 10 in the first round. Caufield was a right winger for Hughes and racked up 82 points in 57 games and has ties to another NTDP first rounder, Alex Turcotte, via the Chicago Jr. Blackhawks. ### “A lot of great players,” said Caufield, who said he spoke to every Canadian team but Toronto. “The practices were like games.” ### EXTRA DANISH, PLEASE ### Caufield was preceded by the tallest of 103 Combine invitees, 6-foot-7 Danish goalie Mads Sogaard. A 19-game winner in Medicine Hat of the WHL, he lost ground to the draft’s top-ranked stopper Spencer Knight when Denmark crashed at the world juniors. He looks up (down actually) to Toronto’s Frederik Andersen and worked with the latter’s father, Ernst, on the national team. ### “Freddy gave him some advice to pass on to me,” Sogaard said. “That was cool. Him being the only Dane to make the NHL is huge motivation for me. ### “I get across the crease pretty fast, but if I want to make the NHL I have to improve all areas of my game, put more weight on (than his 196 pounds).” ### HUGHES, KAKKO REST ### Saturday’s physical testing to end the combine was a bit of a letdown with No. 2 ranked Kaapo Kakko not due to come from Finland until draft week, then Hughes deciding he wouldn’t participate for cautionary reasons. ### “I’ve been playing hockey the last two months, just got back (from the world championships in Slovakia) and haven’t trained at all,” Hughes said. “It’s like not preparing for a test. I didn’t want to risk getting an injury (but) I feel good, physically.” ### MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS ### Hughes, Turcotte and WHL forwards Dylan Cozens (Lethbridge), Kirby Dach (Saskatoon) and defenceman Byram Bowen (Vancouver) departed after the combine for St. Louis, to be showcased prior to Game 4 of the Stanley Cup final. The kids usually get introduced on Coach’s Corner. ### “I’ve got a suit picked out for that,” said Dach, who knows Don Cherry’s obsession with player fashion. ### ICE CHIPS ### Among the busiest prospects this week was goaltender Knight, with all but four teams interviewing him. One club had a question that flummoxed the American — does he like to stop pucks or prevent goals? “I’m still going back and forth on that one,” laughed Knight … Cozens was asked what the biggest misconception people have about his hometown of Whitehorse in the Yukon: “Lots of people think it’s igloos and stuff. It’s just a normal place, working electricity, WiFi, houses ” That said, he misses the solitude of his backyard rink since moving south. “(Play) as long as I wanted. No distractions, no noise” … Cozens already knows something about picking. He’s the nephew of Scott Cozens, co-host of the Canadian Pickers TV show. “I definitely (watched), it’s pretty interesting. Going to his house, he has cool antiques, it’s pretty awesome.” … The prospects went though 12 tests on Saturday, from routine height and weight, to vertical and long jumps, agility and the dreaded wingate cycle. ### lhornby@postmedia.com",60119,1,"Caufield, who was born in Wisconsin, said all small fry owe a recent debt to Chicago’s Alex DeBrincat, who produced 69 goals his first two NHL seasons with similar dimensions.

Hardy (2007) for the most by an NL shortstop before June in a single season, according to the Rockies. ### Story also had a three-run double, walked and scored four times. Nolan Arenado added three hits, including two doubles, and three RBIs. Arenado batted .425 in May. ### ""We do have a good lineup,"" said manager Bud Black, whose team's 183 runs in May is tied for the fourth-most for a month in team history. ""I think it's deep. It has speed. It has power. It has average."" ### Rockies starter German Marquez (6-2) proved just as difficult at the plate as on the mound. He lined two singles in extending his hitting streak to five games, which is the longest by a Rockies pitcher since Mike Hampton hit safely in eight straight in 2002. ### On the mound, Marquez allowed two runs and struck out seven over seven efficient innings. ### ""Great job by Marquez,"" Story said. ""We lean on him and have a lot of confidence in him."" ### For a change, Colorado didn't have to fret late in the game after jumping out to an early 10-2 lead. The Rockies have four walk-off wins in going 7-1 so far on this season-high, 10-game homestand. ### ""It's been nail-biters the past week or so,"" Story said. ""It's nice to have a big lead early."" ### Edwin Jackson (0-3) absorbed a majority of the damage. The veteran right-hander tied a career high by allowing 10 earned runs in lasting just 2 1/3 innings. Jackson remains winless in four starts with his 14th different team after being acquired in a trade with Oakland on May 11. ### ""It has been a while since I've been in a stretch like this. You lose confidence in periods like this,"" Jackson said. ""I still know what I am capable of doing. It's a matter of doing what I can do, but I haven't been doing it the last few starts."" ### Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit a solo homer in the eighth during a four-run inning. Randal Grichuk had a solo shot in the second for the Blue Jays, who've dropped eight of their last nine games. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### TRAINER'S ROOM ### Blue Jays: RHP Aaron Sanchez is on track to start Sunday.

36449,"Review: New ‘Godzilla’ film is a monster failure | Raleigh News & Observer ### Review: New ‘Godzilla’ film is a monster failure ### By RICK BENTLEY Tribune News Service ### May 31, 2019 04:00 AM ### ORDER REPRINT → ### Summarizing the quality of ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" is simple: This ""Godzilla"" is god awful. ### This latest big-screen tale of Godzilla features writing that has more holes than a 90-year-old pair of socks, acting that ranges from comedic to sad and a look that is so dark it is like trying to watch the quick-cut editing style of a Michael Bay ""Transformers"" movie shot using a 15-watt light bulb as illumination. ### What painfully tries to pass as the story is the efforts of the crypto-zoological agency Monarch to deal with a bevy of new creatures – including Mothra, Rodan and the three-headed King Ghidorah – who have awakened. The start of the total annihilation of the human population means only Godzilla can save the day. And that leads to an endless stream of giant creatures battling on the land, in the sea and in the air. ### The fights are probably interesting but there's not a single showdown that doesn't take place either at night, under a cloud of volcanic ash or in a rainstorm so intense there should be people building an ark. This super dark way of shooting helps hide the special effects flaws but it also makes it impossible to know which creature is winning. At least in ""Kong: Skull Island"" there were enough scenes in the bright sunlight to be able to get a look at the great ape. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to The News & Observer content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### There's no way to discuss the logic that sets events in motion because the explanation in the movie makes no sense. There are some good people working with bad people to do good things, but they might be bad and so the good people aren't sure if they really are good or just being bad. It's not surprising that the plot is so full of plot holes because every moment is either an illogical leap or a complete disregard for the laws of physics. ### Granted, this is a monster movie and certain leeway has to be given. That was a lot easier when the Godzilla franchise launched in the mid '50s. The franchise didn't become popular because it took the world of a giant lizard seriously but because the projects were so camp. The approach was so outlandish, anything was acceptable. ### The new Godzilla movies are treated so seriously it is as if they are contending for Oscars and that means there is far less room for moments that are just obviously idiotic beyond measure. Note that there is a spoiler coming so skip the next paragraph if you are still under the delusion of wanting to see this movie. ### To help an injured Godzilla, a submarine crew finds his secret underwater lair. It is so hot from lava and radiation, the vessel can't get close enough to set off the nuclear bomb that will recharge Godzilla. But a one-man sub can reach Godzilla and the pilot can walk to just under the nose of Godzilla to set off the bomb. Either the person should have died from exposure long before the trip or the blast – set off 10-feet from Godzilla's snout – should have turned Godzilla into lizard soup. This is just one example of endless dumb moments in the hackneyed script. ### As if that weren't enough, even more aggravating is that director Michael Dougherty tries to tie this movie to the 2014 feature ""Godzilla"" by tricking the audience into thinking the central characters in the new film were a big part of that effort. The 2014 film focused on the characters played by Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen but the actors (a smart move on their part) are nowhere to be found in this film. ### Dougherty expects audiences to accept that the family drama at the core of ""King of the Monsters"" surrounding the characters played by Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga were the link. The only connection is a 90-second scene at the beginning. The script by Dougherty and Zach Shields takes off as if the history of these players had been established before when in reality they are never established in any form. That means when major decisions are made by this couple (REALLY major decisions), there's no framework to understand the actions other than a tragedy in their life. ### Chandler and Farmiga do their best but both are faced with being locked in a melodrama with nowhere to go but down. The good news is the film is so dark, most of their performances can't be seen. ### The only good thing that can be said is that ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" has accomplished the impossible. It makes all of those cheesy productions of the '50s and '60s look like science fiction masterpieces. ### GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS ### (1/2 star) ### Cast: Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe, Bradley Whitford. ### Director: Michael Dougherty ### Rated: PG-13 for language, action sequences ### Running time: 132 minutes. ### Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. ### PHOTO (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194):",60119,1,"Review: New ‘Godzilla’ film is a monster failure | Raleigh News & Observer###Review: New ‘Godzilla’ film is a monster failure###By RICK BENTLEY Tribune News Service###May 31, 2019 04:00 AM###ORDER REPRINT →","[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]","<p>Review: New ‘Godzilla’ film is a monster failure | Raleigh News & Observer</p><p>Review: New ‘Godzilla’ film is a monster failure</p><p>By RICK BENTLEY Tribune News Service</p><p>May 31, 2019 04:00 AM</p><p>ORDER REPRINT →</p>",992

(AP) — The American photographer who shot the iconic image of a man standing in front of tanks at the 1989 Tiananmen protests says it's time for the Chinese government to come clean about the bloody events of 30 years ago. ### Jeff Widener was an Associated Press photo editor based in Bangkok when he was called in to help cover a growing student-led pro-democracy movement centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square. ### The day after the military crushed the protests on June 3-4, Widener took the shot of an unknown man holding shopping bags facing a row of tanks. The photo of ""tank man"" became one of the most famous images of defiance of the 20th century. ### In an interview, Widener said he doesn't understand why China's leaders won't admit to errors made and reveal the truth behind the crackdown. ### ""The United States and European countries have made mistakes throughout history and they've reconciled those problems,"" Widener told AP. ### ""I think it's time for China to move forward and just come clean on what happened, report to the family members what happened to their loved ones so that they can put this to rest,"" he said. ""I think that's the right, decent thing to do."" ### The 62-year-old Californian developed a love of photography at a young age, eventually joining AP as Southeast Asia picture editor. ### Rejected for a journalist visa at the Chinese Consulate in Bangkok, he flew to Hong Kong, where he got a tourist visa through a travel agency, and made it through customs in Beijing with a mobile darkroom in his luggage. ### With the protests in full swing, he developed a daily routine of riding a bicycle early in the morning to Tiananmen Square, where thousands of students were camped out. ### His May 30, 1989, photo captured the ""Goddess of Democracy,"" the students' version of the Statue of Liberty, facing the portrait of Communist China's first leader, Mao Zedong, on the massive Tiananmen gate. ### ""So you had this democracy facing off with Communism that was quite striking,"" Widener said. ### Soon, the mood began to change. After the government declared martial law, Beijing residents blocked roads to prevent troops — at that time unarmed — from moving toward the square. ### That enraged party elders led by China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, steeling their determination to end the protests by military means. ### On the night of June 3, Widener rode to the square with AP reporter Dan Biers, just as the People's Liberation Army began fighting its way eastward through barricades and crowds of protesters. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### He suffered a serious head injury from a flying piece of asphalt, but made it back to the AP bureau and his hotel. ### Widener emerged the following afternoon to find rock-strewn streets, burnt-out vehicles and a population dazed by the violence deployed against them by the government. ### Asked to get a shot of military forces occupying the square, Widener headed to the Beijing Hotel, which had vantage points close to the action, even as gunfire continued to pop from parts of the city. ### There, he met an American college exchange student, Kirk Martsen, who would play a key role in the tank man tale. Martsen acted as if he and Widener were old friends, allowing the photographer to slip past security men guarding the hotel entrance. ### Subscribe to Breaking News ### Sign up!  ### Martsen had a room on the hotel's sixth floor facing the street, to which he gave Widener access. The problem though, was film. Widener had run out and there was no way to go back to the AP bureau to get more. ### Martsen went hunting among the frightened tourists in the lobby, returning two hours later with a single roll that would prove crucial in the events that followed. ### Widener stayed overnight, and early on June 5, he rushed to the balcony upon hearing the sound of approaching tanks. ### ""I started to take a photograph and a guy walks out with shopping bags and I'm thinking to myself, 'you know this guy's going to mess up my photograph,"" he said. ""I mean it really was like I wasn't thinking clearly."" ### ""So I just watched him and waited. But they didn't shoot him. So I thought you know I need a closer shot,"" he said. ### The man moved at least twice to block the tanks and climbed on the turret of one to converse with a crew member. Eventually, he was whisked from the scene by two men in blue, whose identities, like that of the man himself, have never been revealed. ### At least five photographers as well as videographers shot the scene, but Widener's version became by far the most famous. The photo made him a Pulitzer Prize finalist and was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential images of all time. ### ———",60119,1,"Save###ALHAMBRA, Calif.

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) ### ST. LOUIS — John Moore is ready for his closeup and the chance to make an impact in the Stanley Cup Final. ### Moore is expected to replace injured defenseman Matt Grzelcyk in the Boston Bruins’ lineup for Game 3 at the St. Louis Blues on Saturday night. Grzelcyk is in concussion protocol and didn’t travel with the team, and Moore took his place in practice Friday alongside Connor Clifton. ### “This is why you train, why you prepare, why you take care of yourself,” Moore said. “When you’re called upon, it’s time to do your job.” ### The series is tied 1-1. ### Moore for Grzelcyk is one of a couple holes being filled with injuries and a suspension affecting the plans for coaches Bruce Cassidy of the Bruins and Craig Berube of the Blues. Boston first-line center Patrice Bergeron and Blues first-line winger Vladimir Tarasenko are confirmed to play in Game 3 after each one missed practice for maintenance, but the lineups have to change slightly. ### The Blues will be without important grinder Oskar Sundqvist after their only active player with a Cup ring was suspended one game for boarding Grzelcyk and knocking him out of Game 2 on Wednesday night. Zach Sanford is expected to go in the lineup for his first playoff action since the first round, though Berube wouldn’t confirm that and said injured forward Robert Thomas was a “possibility” to play. ### Neither one can replicate exactly what Sundqvist does for St. Louis. ### “Does a lot of good things for us on both sides of the puck,” Berube said. “Good penalty killer, center, wing, great defensively and has produced for us, too. Good player.” ### Sanford hasn’t played since Game 3 of the Winnipeg series April 14. That’s an even longer layoff than Blues winger Robby Fabbri, who replaced Thomas in Game 2. ### “The guys who haven’t been playing have done a good job of holding each other accountable,” Sanford said. “We’ve been skating, working out. It’s a little different when you get into a game.” ### Moore knows all about this stage after playing for the New York Rangers in the 2014 Cup Final against Los Angeles. ### “It’s definitely one of those things you can take a deep breath, make sure you’re focused,” Moore said. “There are a lot of distractions at this stage of the playoffs. If anything, I feel I’m more mature to handle that and be focused on my job.”",60119,1,"“ Does a lot of good things for us on both sides of the puck,” Berube said. “ Good penalty killer, center, wing, great defensively and has produced for us, too.

He enlisted in the U.S. Army Infantry Division shortly after, following in his uncle Kurt Warner’s footsteps. ### “I’m just excited—I can’t wait to go,” he said. ### However, his mother, Amy McNamara, is not so eager for her son’s July 8 departure to Fort Benning. ### “I have many different emotions. I’m very proud of Kevin—I’m going to miss him tremendously,” she said. “Ever since eighth-grade, he would say, ‘I’m not going to college, I’m going into the military.’… It’s fast approaching for all of us.” ### Mr. McNamara’s fellow classmate, Michael Blanco, is forging his own path as the first member of his family to enlist in the military. ### Entering senior year, he said that he was still unsure of what college he wanted to attend. That’s when he started debating the idea of enlisting in the Navy. ### “I’m excited—I want to leave,” he said referring to the Argonne Road school. “If I could leave for boot camp right now, I would.” ### He will, however, miss his friends—who he said have become his family over the course of his high school career. “It’s going to be a bunch of new people—people I’ve never met before,” he said. ### However, the former varsity wrestler said that he expects those strangers to soon become his next family. “I feel like it will be how wrestling was,” he said. “I’m excited.” ### Hampton Bays High School senior Daniel Grisales is equally as excited to begin his training as a U.S. Marine. “I’m excited to start a new chapter in my life—a little scared, but I’ll get through it,” he said. ### Originally, Mr. Grisales thought he would enroll in Suffolk County Community College—the first step in becoming a police officer. ### But after careful deliberation, and several meetings with recruitment officers from the Army and the Marines, he chose the latter. ### Mr. Grisales’s father, Arnulfo Grisales, served in the military in Columbia, and his uncle, John Grisales, served in the U.S. Army. ### “It’s always been something that I had in the back of my mind,” he said, standing outside the Hampton Bays High School auditorium, referring to his family’s military service. “I just felt at home with the Marines.” ### At Friday’s ceremony—coordinated by Southampton, Westhampton Beach and Hampton Bays district officials—Hampton Bays Superintendent Lars Clemensen thanked the 12 high school seniors for their upcoming service to the country. ### He added that less than 1 percent of eligible men and women enter the U.S. Military every year. ### “Sitting before you are the 1 percent,” he said. “Each, when faced with choosing the path that leads from the graduation stage next month, chose a career of service to our nation.” ### He equally thanked the students’ parents and family members: “The people in the audience are the foundation for why these young people are sitting on the stage today.” ### William Hughes, commander of VFW Post 5350 in Westhampton Beach, left the students with a message. ### Try to remember that in the beginning, obey the rules … You’ll get a chance as you grow to color outside the lines,” he said. “That simple advice worked for me. Your association with the U.S. military will last forever.” ### Each of the 12 students received proclamations from New York State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, state Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele Jr., Suffolk County Executive Steven Bellone and Southampton Town Supervisor Jay Schneiderman. ### Additionally, they were each awarded a $250 scholarship to help cover any impending costs associated with their enlistment. Additionally, as their families joined their children on stage, they were presented with a “Blue Star Flag”—the symbol of a child in service. ### Ms. McNamara, who was honored specifically by Mr. McCarthy toward the conclusion of the ceremony, said she is looking forward to attending her son’s graduation from basic training. “I look forward to seeing what Kevin has to offer for the service.” ### You've read 1 of 7 free articles this month. ### Try a Subscription for just 99¢ ### for the first month.",60119,1,"“ I have many different emotions.

(Chinatopix via AP, File) ### BEIJING (AP) — China issued a report Sunday blaming the United States for a trade dispute and said it won’t back down on “major issues of principle.” ### The statement from the Cabinet spokesman’s office said that China has kept its word throughout 11 rounds of talks and will honor its commitments if a trade agreement is reached. ### “A country’s sovereignty and dignity must be respected, and any agreement reached by the two sides must be based on equality and mutual benefit,” it said. ### The U.S. has accused China of stealing trade secrets and forced technology transfers. The Trump administration has imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports and is planning to tax the $300 billion in imports that have so far been spared. It also escalated the stakes this month by putting the Chinese telecom giant Huawei on a blacklist that effectively bars U.S. companies from supplying it with computer chips, software and other components without government approval. ### Beijing responded by imposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. products, which went into effect Saturday. It also retaliated against the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei by announcing Friday that it will establish its own list of “unreliable entities” consisting of foreign businesses, corporations and individuals. ### Being published in eight languages, Sunday’s report lays out China’s argument for blaming Washington for the frictions as well as the costs to both sides. ### “Whatever the future might bring, China is confident of meeting challenges head on, turning risks into opportunities and opening new chapters,” it said. “China remains committed to its own cause no matter how the external environment changes.” ### “We still have sufficient room for fiscal and monetary policy maneuver” to maintain health of the Chinese economy amid frictions, it said. ### Wang Shaowen, vice commerce minister and deputy international trade representative, said China had been forced to “take forceful measures in response” to U.S. actions and denied China had backtracked on its earlier commitments. ### “It is irresponsible of the U.S. to accuse and smear China,” Wang said. ### In negotiations “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” Wang said. He said the U.S. had made unacceptable demands, including on tariffs and compulsory requirements that infringed on Chinese sovereignty. ### He said of the U.S. tactics: “You give them an inch, they take a yard.” ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Cedar Attanasio ) ### By: ### Associated Press ### Posted: Jun 01, 2019 / 10:37 AM CDT / Updated: Jun 01, 2019 / 10:37 AM CDT ### DALLAS (AP) — About 1,000 people arrive in Texas each day, drawn by jobs, newly built homes and other opportunities. But in a state where a prolonged drought is a regular occurrence, officials are struggling to ensure they can sate everyone's thirst. ### Water experts are trying to determine how ""resilient"" the state's water infrastructure is in keeping safe drinking water flowing through the taps. There are indications that the system is more fragile than once thought:  After Hurricane Harvey  in 2017, more than 200 public water systems shut down or warned customers to boil their tap water. Months later, 3,700 Texans still lacked access to safe drinking water. Before that storm, 30 towns in 2013 were within six months of running out of water as a drought continued to grip the state. ### ""The state is growing so fast that we're constantly playing catch-up when it comes to building resilient water supplies,"" said Robert Mace, executive director of The Meadows Center for Water and the Environment at Texas State University. ""The question is: When the bad times come will there be enough water for everybody?"" ### As the planet warms and weather patterns turn more extreme, droughts — as well as floods — in the state generally have worsened. Meanwhile,  the state population is expected to double  by 2050 to more than 50 million people. ### Some Texas cities are seen as models in planning years in advance to keep supplies flowing to customers. El Paso, which has about 700,000 people living in a desert region that gets only 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain annually, receives international groups wanting to learn more about innovative facilities like the largest inland  desalination plant  in the U.S. San Antonio launched its own desalination plant in 2017 and next year intends to begin importing water from a well field 140 miles (225 kilometers) away, giving the area a dozen different sources of water for some 2.5 million people. ### But the big-ticket projects in Texas and greater push for long-term planning — the state every five years updates its water strategy based on a 50-year outlook — smack head-on against infrastructure defined by aging water lines, outdated treatment plants and smaller utilities focused on their own interests rather than regional ones. ### These and other factors were at play when Texas cities and utilities in 2015 issued 1,550 boil-water advisories, up from about 1,100 in 2012 and 650 in 2008, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. ### Such problems don't become easier when the rains wane. ### ""We're actually falling more behind for the big one, the repeat of the drought of record,"" Mace said. ### Texas in 2002 was lagging by 2.4 million acre feet in meeting water demands at the height of severe drought, he said, and now the state is 4.7 million acre feet behind. An acre foot amounts to 1 foot (0.3 meter) of water across an acre of land. ### Smaller communities ""are the ones really struggling,"" Mace said. Many don't have the customer base to afford a revamped water supply without a substantial increase in water bills. They're also home to utilities that experts say are risk-averse and reluctant to embrace new technology. ### Robert Paterson, an associate professor at the University of Texas with expertise in growth management and sustainable community development, said Texas trails other states when it comes to broad regional planning that incorporates water needs, land use and other aims. As Paterson notes, watersheds don't care about boundaries. ### ""To have it all fragmented from city to city is really problematic and very wasteful,"" Paterson said. ### His sentiment isn't lost on the Texas Water Development Board. The agency, which coordinates water planning and strategy in Texas, recently altered its approach by no longer basing long-term strategy on political or city boundaries, according to Temple McKinnon, its director of water use, projections and planning. The focus now is on the needs and projections of water providers. ### ""Converting to utility-based planning has been a herculean effort,"" McKinnon acknowledged. ### The work is no easier for water providers, which experts say must cobble together the money necessary to deliver a plentiful amount of safe, potable water — through conservation programs, groundwater and surface water supplies, reservoirs, water reuse and other means. ### ""There's not a silver bullet, more like a silver machine gun, in the sense of many different strategies that can be employed to meet the state's demands,"" Mace said.",60119,1,"Some Texas cities are seen as models in planning years in advance to keep supplies flowing to customers.

Officials say the levee breached early Friday at Dardanelle, about 60 miles northwest of Little Rock. (Yell County Sheriff's Department via AP) AP ### LITTLE ROCK, Ark. ### Crews were making a ""last ditch effort"" on Saturday to save low-lying parts of a small Arkansas city from floodwaters pouring through a breached levee, as authorities downstream were warning people to leave a neighborhood that sits across the swollen river from the state capital. ### The Arkansas River, which has been flooding communities for more than a week, tore a 40-foot (12-meter) hole Friday in a levee in Dardanelle, a city of about 4,700 people roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) upstream from Little Rock. ### On Saturday, Mayor Jimmy Witt said officials don't believe that a temporary levee being constructed will stop the water from flooding the south side of Dardanelle, but he hopes it will buy time for residents of up to 800 threatened homes to prepare. ### ""We have started a last ditch effort to try and protect the southern borders of the city,"" he said at a news conference. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to The Island Packet content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### The river has been widening the levee breach and floodwaters have been slowly approaching homes, officials said. Water from some creeks and tributaries has already flooded some houses, they said. Yell County Judge Mark Thone said flooding has surrounded about 25 people in a rural community a few miles south of Dardanelle, and several roads have closed due to high water. ### Meanwhile in North Little Rock, which is just across the Arkansas River from Little Rock, officials were going door-to-door Saturday to tell people in the Dixie Addition neighborhood to consider leaving. ### The river isn't expected to crest in the Little Rock area until Tuesday, but North Little Rock officials said on Facebook that they believe the river will back up storm drainage areas and cause roads to become inaccessible in and around Dixie Addition, possibly for more than a week. ### City spokesman Nathan Hamilton said there are about 150 homes covered by the evacuation recommendation. He said other homes also could be affected by flooding, but officials were currently focusing on only the most pressing neighborhood. ### The evacuation recommendation followed a false alarm overnight that a nearby levee had breached and that flash flooding was possible. Officials quickly reversed themselves, though, and said that it hadn't failed and wasn't in danger of doing so. ### Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday that officials were working to identify higher-risk spots in the Arkansas River's levee system. ### ""Obviously the breach in Dardanelle is a sign that there could be more of these breaches that will happen as the pressure continues to mount in the coming days,"" Hutchinson said. ### Record-breaking flood levels in Fort Smith, Arkansas' second-largest city, remained steady through the morning, with the National Weather Service predicting the water would begin to recede Saturday night into Sunday morning. ### The Arkansas River isn't the only one causing problems in the region. ### Officials in Illinois issued an ""urgent plea"" to residents of river communities to prepare for potential evacuations. The state's Emergency Management Agency director, Alicia Tate-Nadeau, called flooding a ""life-safety issue,"" and the agency said levees along the Illinois River were in critical condition. ### Flooding along the Missouri River in central Missouri prompted officials to issue a mandatory evacuation order Friday for some residents of Howard County, where the river had topped a levee. A topped levee along the Mississippi River, in northeastern Missouri, flooded several thousand acres of farmland Thursday. ### In Oklahoma, water levels continued to drop as residents who were forced from their homes made plans to return.

45958,"Trump caves to King Corn yet again ### Trump caves to King Corn yet again ### Jazz ShawPosted at 11:31 am on June 1, 2019 ### Share on Facebook ### Share on Twitter ### We were sending up the red flags about this move by the EPA back in March , but it appears that King Corn has scored another victory at the agency and the Trump administration has backed out of a compromise they offered earlier. After a remarkably short period of review and public comment, the EPA has moved to allow year-round sales of E-15 blended gasoline , despite serious concerns over the implications of this change. For those not aware, E-15 has 50% more ethanol in it than the normal E-10 mixture previously allowed to be sold during the warmer summer months. (Washington Examiner) ### The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday officially opened up year-round sales of higher ethanol fuel blends, called E15, fulfilling a promise President Trump made to Iowa corn farmers. ### Trump has firmly backed the year-round sale of 15% ethanol fuel, despite opposition by the oil industry and refiners who argue the fuel would harm vehicle engines. ### The E15 rule, a boon to corn farmers, follows billions of dollars the administration has doled out to farmers as compensation for the losses they’ve suffered from tariffs imposed in the trade war with China. ### The issues surrounding the ethanol lobby, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the dubious market built around Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) continues to be one of the most disappointing aspects of the Trump administration. And this new accommodation offered up to win the political favor of a few corn-growing states just reinforces that perception. ### When this foolish plan was first brought up, the White House offered to somewhat soften the blow with a compromise. They were to open an investigation of the RIN market and monitor it for abuses costing smaller oil refineries millions of dollars per year. But when the new rule was announced on Friday, the compromise disappeared and no such effort was put in place. This was yet another betrayal of the President’s many supporters in states with numerous jobs in the oil and gas industry. ### As I brought up in my column back in March (linked above), the rule change itself is unwise on many levels. It’s long been known that in addition to being a poor fuel compared to gasoline, the combustion of ethanol leads to significant increases in smog levels when temperatures are warmer. The higher ethanol levels in gasoline also lead to increased damage to marine motors, coming at a time when boating activity is at its highest across the country. To avoid that outcome, boaters have to resort to using more ethanol removal products or seek out more expensive, ethanol-free gas. ### I get that the President made certain promises to the ethanol lobby in Iowa because he wanted to win the election. But he’s long since made good on those promises, to the dismay of many other politically important states where refineries operate. Perhaps he should be considering the following question. Is it really a viable strategy to keep dumping favors on Iowa if it winds up costing you Pennsylvania and part of the Gulf Coast in the process?",60119,1,"As I brought up in my column back in March (linked above), the rule change itself is unwise on many levels.

""We didn't think anything else of it at that point."" ### But when Jackson began running a fever with light pink spots on his body, Oblisk said she took his to the doctor. ### ""We were told it's a viral rash, it's going to go away, you just have to wait it out, there's really nothing we can do,"" Oblisk said. ### Slowly, the rash turned into aching pain and an emergency room visit on Memorial Day. ### Someone had mentioned Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, but Oblisk said it was too rare to believe. The chance of getting bit by a tick with the bacterial disease is one in 20,000. ### Still, the potentially fatal disease was exactly what her son had. ### ""My kid wouldn't get up, he wouldn't eat he wouldn't drink, he was running a 105 degree fever,"" Oblisk said. ""We couldn't get him to do anything, if you touched him he screamed."" ### Oblisk said she was told day eight with the disease often sees death. Her son was treated on day seven. ### ""I'm so glad that as a parent I said to myself ya know something isn't right and followed it,"" Oblisk said. ### Her tough toddler fought for his life at Norton Children's Hospital, unable to wake up. Finally, on his second birthday, he woke up for the first time. ### ""Just celebrating the fact that we are almost positive that he is going to be okay,"" Oblisk said. ### Spotted fever responds well to antibiotics, and Oblisk said she believes her son recover. ### After an injury left her husband without a job, Oblisk is struggling to pay for Jackson's treatment.

The statement described state Health Director Amy Acton's adjudication order as a rare event. ### The hospital also has been ordered to test and clean its ice machines, clean and service its on-site cooling towers, and provide all test results and a water management plan to the Health Department. ### If Mount Carmel fails to follow Acton's directives, she will order the hospital to stop accepting patients, the statement said. ### State and Franklin County health officials were conducting an environmental assessment at Mount Carmel on Saturday morning. ### Mount Carmel spokeswoman Samantha Irons said in a statement late Friday that the hospital is running additional tests on its water sources and that its water supply is receiving ""supplemental"" disinfection. She said hospital officials are confident Mount Carmel can maintain full services ""while we study this situation."" ### The Mount Carmel statement said anyone who has been hospitalized at the facility and develops a cough, muscle aches, headaches or shortness of breath should contact their primary care physician. ### The Centers for Disease Control and Infection website says people are infected with Legionnaires' by inhaling airborne water droplets containing the Legionella bacteria. Cooling towers containing water and a fan as part of a centralized cooling system are a potential source for Legionella, the CDC says. ### While most healthy people are unaffected, those over 50, smokers and others with weakened immune systems and chronic lung disease are most at risk of being infected, the CDC says. ### The Mount Carmel system has been under intense scrutiny after discovering that a doctor had prescribed excessive doses of painkillers to 29 patients who died at its other hospitals. ### Get Trib headlines sent directly to you, every day. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

11653,"Russia’s Soyuz rocket got nailed by lightning shortly after launch ### news 10 hours ago BGR — Mike Wehner ### When planning for a rocket launch there are many things that have to be taken into account, and one of the biggest factors is always the weather. Launches are delayed frequently due to uncooperative weather conditions such as brisk high-level winds and storms, but sometimes Mother Nature can throw a serious curve ball right in the middle of a seemingly routine rocket ascent. ### That was the case on Monday when a Russian Soyuz rocket endured a lightning strike shortly after takeoff from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia. The launch was being recorded by observers, and video of the surprising lighting blast is now available for all of us to enjoy. ### In a tweet posted by Russian space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin we can see the rocket headed skyward and the bright bolt of lightning appearing to strike the vehicle and then proceed down toward the ground: ### The rocket wasn’t carrying any human passengers, but it was ferrying a GLOSNASS-M navigation satellite into Earth orbit. The rocket and its payload were reportedly no worse for wear after the lightning strike. Russia’s Roscosmos space agency said that the satellite was functioning normally and appears to not have been affected by the event. ### As SpaceflightNow notes, this is hardly the first rocket to be met with a surprise bolt of lightning on its way into space. In fact, the launch of Apollo 12 had to deal with a similar issue when lightning struck the launch vehicle two times in a row within a minute of takeoff. The blast affected the command module’s electronics as well as its fuel cells but the crew was able to correct for the changes mid-flight and save the mission. ### Russia’s Soyuz rocket made it through the ordeal unscathed, and Roscosmos is using the event as an example of how reliable its rocket technology is. ### Sign up for BGR's Newsletter .

28514,"Hollywood Loves Abortion Because The Entertainment Industry Wants Sex Without Consequences ### Bill Donohue   May 31, 2019   |   6:02PM    Washington, DC ### Share this story: ### Hollywood has long been out of touch with most Americans, which is one reason why few bother to watch its annual self-congratulatory pageant called the Oscars. ### ADVERTISEMENT ### If there is one issue that divides Hollywood from the rest of the nation, it is abortion. It’s not hard to figure out why: Those who work in the entertainment industry want sex without consequences, and that means no more unwanted babies (and no more STDs). Which is why they are so passionate about abortion. ### It does not exaggerate to say that Hollywood has a love affair with abortion. How else can one interpret the mania displayed by Tinseltown over recent state laws restricting abortion? Look at the reaction to the “heartbeat” bill that was passed in Georgia. ### Led by Disney (Walt must be turning over in his grave) chief Bob Iger, the big thinkers in Hollywood have all lined up, single file. Netflix, WarnerMedia, CBS, Showtime, NBCUniversal, AMC Networks, Sony Pictures, STX and Viacom have all said they may pack up and leave Georgia if the bill becomes law. They currently receive generous tax incentives to produce movies there. ### What makes this issue so rich with irony is the fact that Hollywood contributes mightily to one of the root causes of abortion: promiscuity. To be specific, the kind of graphic sexual fare that Hollywood produces—it has been eroticizing the culture for decades—helps to create an environment where men and women are more likely to abandon restraint. ### Hollywood denies any cause and effect between its sexual fare and promiscuity. But it won’t work. Why did Hollywood decide long ago not to feature smoking in movies? Because it didn’t want to create an environment which induced young people to smoke. They can’t have it both ways. ### Here’s more irony. The same guy leading the fight against Georgia, Bob Iger, has admitted that movies which show actors smoking induces people to smoke. In 2007, he said that Disney “will place an anti-smoking PSA [Public Service Announcement] on DVD’s of any future film that does depict smoking. In addition, we will work with theater owners to encourage the exhibition of an anti-smoking PSA before the theatrical exhibition of any such film.”  ### LifeNews.com ### So Hollywood not only stopped making as many movies that featured smoking, it launched an educational anti-smoking campaign. ### Imagine if Hollywood stopped making as many sexually saturated movies, and decided to launch an educational anti-promiscuity campaign? That might lead to behavioral changes, one of which would be a decrease in sexual recklessness, which in turn might lessen the need for an abortion option. ### Bob Iger, and his colleagues in Hollywood, know what’s going on, but they don’t have the will to do anything about it. Instead, they are content to declare war on Georgia.",60119,1,"If there is one issue that divides Hollywood from the rest of the nation, it is abortion.

Her party is now in the midst of a heated race to decide who will be its next leader — and the country's next prime minister. ### In an interview Friday with the British tabloid The Sun, Trump said Bor is Johnson — the divisive populist and ex-foreign secretary who is favorite to replace May — would make an ""excellent"" prime minister. ### ""I think Boris would do a very good job. I think he would be excellent,"" Trump said. ### The president also referred to the American-born Duchess of Sussex as ""nasty"" over comments she made in 2016 threatening to move to Canada if Trump won the White House. ### But he wished her well in her new life as a princess. ""I am sure she will do excellently,"" he added. ### The comments threatened to overshadow the build up to Trump's long-awaited state visit. ### Trump is widely disliked in the U.K. He has a positive opinion rating of only 21 percent, according to YouGov, compared to 72 percent for former President Barack Obama. ### But he told The Sun Friday that “I don’t imagine any U.S. president was ever closer to your great land.” ### ""Now I think I am really — I hope — I am really loved in the U.K.,"" he added. ""I certainly love the U.K."" ### On Tuesday, the day after Trump’s arrival, thousands of people are expected to hit the streets of the capital to protest, like they did during his last visit in July. ### It was a similar story for President George W. Bush, whose state visit came eight months after the invasion of Iraq. ### Yet it’s precisely because of the U.K.'s Brexit mess that it needs this visit now more than ever. ### With no Brexit deal in sight, and future trade ties with Europe now up in the air, a trade deal with the U.S. has become increasingly important. ### “The cleaner the Brexit, the easier it is for the U.S. to strike a free trade deal with the U.K.,” said Leslie Vinjamuri, the head of the U.S. and Americas program at the Chatham House think tank. ### “That plays into the hands of those who are pushing for a hard Brexit,” from the E.U. with no agreement setting out a framework for future relations. ### On his last visit to the U.K., Trump didn’t hold back. ### He blasted May over Brexit and warned that her plan could scuttle an American trade deal with the U.K. because Britain would remain too close with the E.U. ### In his interview Friday Trump again criticized May's handling of Brexit, saying she ""didn't give the European Union anything to lose"" in negotiations. ### “Any foreign intervention into something as sensitive as Brexit is tricky and likely to put people in a bad political position. People here will be very nervous on the extent to which they engage with it,” said Vinjamuri. ### There are few precedents when it comes to presidential state visits. This is only the third for a U.S. president since the queen assumed the throne in 1952, with Bush receiving the honor in 2003 and Obama in 2011. The queen only hosts one or two state visits a year. ### This trip will stand in stark contrast to Obama’s visit in particular. ### Obama and his wife Michelle were welcomed by the queen, as well as the glamour couple of the time, Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, who had married only a month earlier. Their Buckingham Palace banquet was filled with glitz and glamour and included former prime ministers as well as the mayor of London, and even actor Tom Hanks. ### Ahead of Trump's arrival, however, some of the U.K.’s most senior politicians have said that the visit is a mistake and that they won’t attend the Queen’s uber-formal state dinner at Buckingham Palace. ### Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has refused to join the white tie event and said that May ""should not be rolling out the red carpet for a state visit to honor a president who rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric."" ### Corbyn, however, has been criticized for inviting members of Hamas and Hezbollah to an event in Parliament in 2009 and for calling the groups “friends.” Both groups are classified by the U.K. and U.S. as terrorist groups and have repeatedly called for the destruction of the State of Israel. ### But he’s not the only political leader refusing to meet with the president. ### Vince Cable, leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, also turned down a seat at the dinner with Trump. And Mayor of London Sadiq Khan called May’s invitation “ill-judged” and called on her to revoke it in 2017 when it was first made. ### Despite the objections to Trump's visit and the difficulty for U.K. politicians to head off any explosive comments the president may make, experts say that the close relationship between the two countries is bigger than their leaders. ### “The government has made big attempt to say to people that however much you may find Trump objectionable you must distinguish the man from the office,” said the former Ambassador to the U.S. Christopher Meyer. ### ""This is a state visit, this is an honor for the whole of the U.S.""",60119,1,""" Now I think I am really — I hope — I am really loved in the U.K.,"" he added.

He was 71. ### Erickson's sinuous lead guitar and wailing vocals didn't turn him into a chart topper, but they cemented his role as a musician's musician. Fans included everyone from Lenny Kaye and the Swedish metal group Ghost - who covered his ""If You Have Ghosts"" - to ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons. ### A 1990 tribute album to Erickson, ""Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye,"" attracted the likes of R.E.M., T-Bone Burnett, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Julian Cope, The Mighty Lemon Drops, Primal Scream and ZZ Top. ### Erickson's death on Friday was announced by his brother, Mikel Erickson, on Facebook and confirmed by his agent, Dave Kaplan. The cause and location of death were not revealed. ### ""It's almost unfathomable to contemplate a world without Roky Erickson. He created his own musical galaxy and early on was a true inspiration,"" Gibbons said in a statement. ### After the trippy 13th Floor Elevators dissolved in the face of drug arrests and instability, Erickson in the early '70s entered an insanity plea to a marijuana possession charge and ended up spending some time in an institution. ### A short-lived effort to reunite the Elevators followed. Erickson put out a book of poetry - ""Openers"" - and continued making music, including the songs ""Two Headed Dog"" and the LP ""The Evil One."" ### In 1986, he released the album ""Don't Slander Me,"" and a 2005 documentary by Keven McAlester about him was called ""You're Gonna Miss Me.""

She added that she has yet to receive the actual visa or set a date for her trip. ### If she could bring him anything, she said, it would be his favorite Mexican food dish: enchiladas. ### Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obradór lobbied for the visa to be issued after receiving a letter in February from Loera asking for assistance. In the letter, passed to Lopez Obradór while he was in Guzman's home state of Sinaloa to announce a highway project, Loera described herself as ""suffering and desperate"" to see her son. ### The president said he intervened out of empathy for the mother. When Guzman was convicted in the U.S. in February, Lopez Obradór said: ""Let this serve as a lesson to show that money doesn't buy true happiness."" ### ""El Chapo,"" who led the Sinaloa drug cartel and twice escaped from Mexican prisons before he was extradited to New York, was convicted of running an industrial-scale smuggling operation. The three-month trial heard tales of grisly killings, political payoffs, cocaine hidden in jalapeno cans and jewel-encrusted guns. ### Guzman's lawyers did not deny his crimes but argued that he was a fall guy for government witnesses who were more evil than their client. ### He is due to be sentenced this month and faces a life term in a maximum-security U.S. prison selected to guard against another of the jail breakouts that made him a folk hero in Mexico. ### Loera reiterated that she would like her son to be returned to Mexico and to be set free. Both possibilities seem highly unlikely. ### Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 after having served eight years. He moved between hideouts for years until being imprisoned again in 2014, only to escape a year later through an expertly dug tunnel leading to his prison cell shower. ### Part of his success moving drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border also involved sophisticated tunnels.",60119,1,"Consuelo Loera, mother of Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, arrives to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, Mexico, Saturday, June 1, 2019.

60968,"Tasteless tomatoes may be on the way out ###  ### By Jeanette MarantosLos Angeles Times (TNS) ### Friday ### May 31, 2019 at 3:30 PM ### At last! Scientific confirmation of what anyone with a palate already knew: Supermarket tomatoes, by and large, are as tasty as raw potatoes, which is to say they basically have no flavor at all. ### As humans have tried to develop a tough-skinned, slow-ripening commercial tomato that would survive the rigors of long-distance transport, it appears the flavor genes got left behind, says molecular biologist James Giovannoni. ### Consumers have been grousing about Flavorgate for years, Giovannoni said, especially when they compare the supermarket varieties to the tomatoes that Grandma used to grow, or even the ones they grew last summer in their yards. ### “Lots of people don’t know what a fresh peach should taste like because they’ve never grown one, but tomatoes are a little unique,” he said. “If you’re growing anything at your home, it’s probably a tomato plant, even if it’s on your balcony, so people know what a good tomato should taste like.” ### Nonetheless, he said, Americans continue buying blah tomatoes, to the tune of more than 20 pounds per man, woman and child in 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, making tomatoes the second most consumed produce over — of course — potatoes. ### “They add color and when you cover them with ranch dressing, you don’t taste it anyway,” Giovannoni joked. ### But now breeders have a key for reinserting some flavor into their tomatoes, while still keeping them market tough. ### Giovannoni, of the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service Plant, Soil and Nutrition Research Laboratory, and fellow researcher Zhangjun Fei, a bioinformatics scientist at the Boyce Thompson Institute, both in Ithaca, N.Y., have constructed a pan-genome — basically the entire set of genes — for 725 different cultivated tomatoes and their wild relatives, discovering 5,000 previously undocumented genes. ### Turns out wild tomatoes have lots of flavor but they’re also tiny, around the size of a pea, Giovannoni said. Humans began cultivating larger mutants of the wild variety, that originated in South America. ### The researchers discovered one particular gene — dubbed TomLoxC — that is present in 91% of the tasty wild varieties, primarily Solanum pimpinellifolium, a.k.a. currant tomatoes, which are sometimes used as a garnish in fancy restaurants, Giovannoni said, served on a stem like a cluster of tiny grapes to add a little pop of tomato flavor. ### But — surprise, surprise — TomLoxC was only present in about 2% of cultivated varieties, including heirlooms. ### TomLoxC actually provides more fragrance than flavor, Giovannoni said, but aromatics are a huge component of how things taste. “This isn’t the only reason tomatoes have flavor. A lot of it is sugar and acids and the balance between the two. But aromatics are important. Your perception of flavor is what your taste buds are telling you and what your olfactory — smell — system is telling you.” ### Now that researchers have teased out a critical flavor gene, breeders can start adding it to the mix when they create new commercial varieties. And now that they know what genes provide specific qualities, they can test their new plants when they’re only a few inches tall, to see if they include all the qualities they want, from long shelf life to TomLoxC aromatics. ### “Breeding has been more of an art,” Giovannoni said “This makes it more of a precise science.” ### If you don’t want to wait for the breeders, here’s a list of existing tomato varieties with the cherished TomLoxC gene — both heirloom and hybrid types — that you can plant at home, or look out for at specialty markets and farmers markets: ### Sugar Lump has golf-ball size fruit. The rest are cherry-size tomatoes: Peacevine Cherry, Yellow Cherry, Snowberry (yellow-white), Galina (yellow), Katinka Cherry (Russian heirloom orange-red), Gardener’s Delight, Marcellino Hybrid, and Super Sweet 100 Hybrid. ### Never miss a story ### Choose the plan that's right for you. ### Digital access or digital and print delivery.",60119,1,"Now that researchers have teased out a critical flavor gene, breeders can start adding it to the mix when they create new commercial varieties.

98732,"'The lyrics do not unite anyone': Ferguson weighs into anthem debate ### Very large text size ### Blake Ferguson has not sung Advance Australia Fair in three years. ### But he makes a point of telling Indigenous youngsters to make up their own minds about singing the national anthem. ### Blake Ferguson would also have remained silent during the national anthem on Wednesday had he made the Blues side. ### Credit:Wolter Peeters ### And Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter Beattie has welcomed the stance taken by NSW players Cody Walker, Josh Addo-Carr and Latrell Mitchell, as well as Queensland's Will Chambers, to remain silent at Suncorp Stadium on Wednesday as the anthem plays. ### Beattie said he hoped the bumper crowd would respect ""those who remain silent or those in full voice"". ### Advertisement ### Parramatta flyer Ferguson said he was proud of Walker's stance to not sing the anthem and that his comments in Wednesday's Herald  had sparked a healthy week-long debate. ### ""I'm not pushing my views on anyone – it's just how me and my family have grown up and how I feel ... I want to reiterate it's just my opinion,'' Walker said. ### Ferguson, who played alongside Walker in the Indigenous All Stars game at the start of the year and joined the Blues newcomer for visits to Indigenous communities, said it was important for the next generation to make up their own minds. ### Loading ### ""The anthem is not what I stand for, and if you hear the lyrics, they do not unite anyone,'' Ferguson told The Sun-Herald. ### ""I'm so happy someone like Cody, who has strong ties with his community back home, came out and stood by what he believes in. It's his opinion. I haven't sung it since 2016. ### ""I'm so proud of Cody, it's such a brave thing to do. He's coming out on behalf of all the Indigenous people ... We all think it, nobody said anything, but he finally came out and said something. ### ""I've been to Wellington [central-western NSW] a few times now. I went up to Maclean with Cody and Damien Cook, and a few of the Souths boys. Giving back to regional NSW and regional Queensland is close to my heart. ### ""If a kid comes up to me [and asks about the anthem], I'll tell them everyone has their own opinion and it's their choice. It's not my way or the highway. They have to reach the decision for themselves."" ### Ferguson said the best solution was to change the anthem. ### Beattie stressed the importance of inclusiveness to rugby league and said it was a player's right to sing or not to sing. ### ""People will sing the anthem on Wednesday night – I'll be standing in the grandstand singing – but I also didn't experience a history of suffering the [Indigenous] people went through,'' Beattie said. ### ""It's about accepting different points of view. The players who have spoken this week have been respectful, they have simply stated their case and nobody has been grandstanding about it. ### ""Players and fans have never been required to sing the Australian anthem. We simply expect them to treat the occasion with respect and dignity. I wouldn't expect booing for those who choose to sing or not to sing."" ### Meanwhile, Walker's Souths halves partner, Adam Reynolds, spoke of his relief at being cleared of a broken leg. ### Reynolds was able to take the field on Friday night against Parramatta and quipped his teammates had been refering to the injury as a ""grade-three carry-on"". ### Loading ### The 28-year-old, who was right in the hunt for a Blues return, backed debutant Walker to thrive against Queensland. ### ""I don't know [if he will handle the Origin pressure], but he has stepped up and delivered every game he plays here,'' Reynolds said. ### ""He's pretty cranky at training and seems to hate the world some days. But he's a great character and we love having him around the club.'' ### Ferguson added: ""He'll be ready next Wednesday. I'm excited to see him play.

The release of 460 pages of documents related to the Chicago police investigation of Smollett show detectives were informed a possible deal with the actor was in the works a month before it was announced. The documents released Thursday show detectives leading the investigation into Smollett's claim he was the victim of a hate crime were told by Cook County prosecutors a deal with Smollett was in the works that may include a $10,000 fine and community service. ### Paul Beaty ### Subscribe ### Smollett faced 16 felony counts related to making a false report that he was assaulted by two men early on Jan. 29. Investigators said he made the false report because he was unhappy with his pay on ""Empire"" and believed such an incident would give his career a boost. Foxx's office dropped the charges on March 26 without any admission of guilt by Smollett, prompting a hail of criticism, including from then Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. ### Foxx's office released the hundreds of police reports, warrants, internal emails and texts — that media organization had requested for months — as offices closed for the weekend Friday evening. A judge had approved release of the files last week. ### Among the documents were letters to Foxx from supporters of Smollett in February, urging her office to rethink the charges. ### One letter was from New York attorney Brian Ponder, who wrote ""#NotJustJussie"" in the subject line. ### He wrote in his letter, dated Feb. 21, 2019, that he understood the gravity of a false-report accusation, but added that, ""We trust such charges are not only pursued due to social, political, or racial bias."" He said: ""We trust your office will review, investigate, and charge all false reporters, and not just Jussie. America is watching."" ### The recusal issue has continued to dog the state's attorney's office. ### In late March — after questions were raised about the dropping of charges — Foxx and her aides sought to recast her role, with one statement saying Foxx ""used the term 'recuse'"" in the ""colloquial use of the term."" They said the correct description was that she had ""informally separated herself from the decision-making"" in the case. ### As documents released earlier illustrated, Foxx nevertheless weighed in at critical points as her staff decided whether to proceed with the prosecution, which began when Smollett was charged on Feb. 20. Her input included a March 8 text to First Assistant State's Attorney Joseph Magats, who became the final decision-maker in the Smollett case after Foxx purportedly stepped away. ### Foxx texted: ""Sooo ...... I'm recused, but when people accuse us of overcharging cases ... 16 counts on a class 4 becomes exhibit A."" ### Magats responded to his boss, saying: ""Yes. I can see where that can be seen as excessive."" ### In her direct Friday statement, Foxx called the Smollett case ""unique."" ### ""Allegations of a vicious homophobic and racially motivated attack shook our city and the nation with understandable anger and fear,"" she said. And she added: ""I did not have a conflict of interest in this case; only a sincere desire to serve the community."" ### But she also conceded that the matter, especially on the recusal issue, wasn't handled as well as it could have been. ### ""I regret that my attempts to this end created confusion outside the office,"" she said. She added later: ""I am sorry that despite the best intentions, our efforts were less than what was required of the moment,"" she said. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

If you suspect your cat or dog may have ingested a potentially toxic substance, contact your veterinarian as soon as possible. ### Aloe Vera ### You may like to keep an aloe vera plant around to treat sunburns, but the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) says aloe vera can cause vomiting, lethargy and diarrhea in both cats and dogs. According to  Rover.com , “Topical use of the gel found inside the leaves is no problem, but there are other proponents of the plant that can irritate the digestive system if ingested.” These 11 household items are seriously hazards to pets. ### Azaleas ### Whether indoors or out, azaleas are toxic to both dogs, cats and reptiles. “Even ingesting just a few azalea leaves can cause oral irritation with subsequent vomiting and diarrhea in cats. In severe cases, ingestion can cause a drop in blood pressure, heart arhythmias, coma and death,” notes  petMD. ### Dracaena Fragrans ### Also known as the “corn plant,” dracaena fragrans is a popular houseplant that is toxic to pets, including cats and dogs, according to the  ASPCA.  When ingested, the plant can cause vomiting (occasionally with blood), depression, anorexia, hyper-salivation and, in cats, dilated pupils. ### Tulips ### Some popular summer flowering plants, such as tulips, pictured, can be toxic to the health of dogs and cats. (iStock) ### The whole tulip plant is toxic to both cats and dogs, says the  ASPCA . In cats, “Ingestion can cause significant oral irritation, excessive drooling and nausea.

94083,"James Wilcox ### Longview ISD superintendent ### Now that the 86th Texas legislative session has ended, public schools will see changes in how they are funded. ### House Bill 3 decreases property taxes in school districts and increases public funding to schools, according to the Texas Tribune. Specifically, teachers will see pay increases, schools will get more money per student and full-day prekindergarten will be funded for low-income families. ### Full-day pre-K funding caught Spring Hill ISD’s attention. ### Superintendent Wayne Guidry said the board approved adding a new pre-K teacher position at a special meeting Wednesday night. Spring Hill has a half-day pre-K program. ### Before making a final decision on switching to a full-day pre-K program, Guidry said the district is trying to get a head count on how many families would participate. ### “We need it,” Guidry said. “Every school district needs it. There are many schools that offer full-day pre-K but only get funded for half-day.” ### Before HB 3, districts received $5,140 per student, Guidry said. But for pre-K students, districts would receive half that amount — even if the district had a full-day program. ### Now, schools will receive $6,160 per student, even for pre-K students. ### Pine Tree ISD has a full-day pre-K program that was being only half-funded, so Superintendent Steve Clugston said the funding change is welcomed. ### “That’s an expense we’ve kind of had to squeeze out of our budget, which is a pretty good amount of money,” he said. “This allows us to not have to squeeze so tight.” ### White Oak ISD is not looking at making changes right away to its half-day pre-K, Superintendent Mike Gilbert said. ### “Because of the late time frame — we’re two months away from starting school again, basically — we’re not planning to change for 2019-2020,” he said. “We are going to look at that during the school year and make plans to make adjustments where we need to for the 2020-2021 school year.” ### Districts also are welcoming another change the bill provides — an increase in teacher compensation. ### HB 3 mandates schools spend a portion of the increase in funds per student on teacher, librarian, counselor and nurse pay raises, according to the Tribune. School districts will have some flexibility on how to distribute that extra money to teachers, so exact numbers are unavailable. ### Longview ISD Superintendent James Wilcox said his understanding of the legislation is that 30 percent of the district’s increased funding must be spent on raises for all school employees. ### Gilbert also said wording in the bill led him to believe 30 percent of the new funds will go to staff raises, which is something White Oak will have to sort out once the district knows how much it will get in new funds. ### Along with new funds being pumped into districts, HB 3 lowers tax rates for homeowners in school districts. According to the Tribune, the bill lowers tax rates 7 cents per $100 valuation. ### “We have a community that’s agreed to pay a lot more taxes to fund our current system, and one thing that’s nice about the tax change is we had an 11-cent decline compared to some districts,” Guidry said. “That’s good for homeowners. In 2021, that’ll go down another cent.” ### The White Oak tax rate will supposedly go down 10 cents, Gilbert said, making the tax rate $1.06 per $100 valuation. ### While the decrease in tax rate is good for homeowners in school districts, some superintendents are concerned about how stable future revenue will be. ### Gilbert said collecting less in taxes but getting more money are ideas that typically do not go together, and that makes the district guarded about future revenue sources. ### Guidry has similar concerns. ### “The problem is, we’ve just decreased property taxes. We’ve increased revenue to school districts. Where’s the money coming from?” he asked. “Right now, we just happen to have a great economy with surplus that’s funding this. What happens when things don’t go so well? Where does the funding come from at that point?” ### Graduations ### 05.31.19 ### Les Hassell/News-Journal Photo ### Pine Tree High School graduate Tyler Bain, who has used a wheelchair since age 4, walks across the stage to collect his diploma during Friday’s commencement at Pirate Stadium. ### Les Hassell/News-Journal Photo ### Pine Tree graduate Tyler Bain, who has used a wheelchair since the age of four, walks across the stage to collect his diploma during Friday’s May 31, 2019 commencement at Pirate Stadium.

It’s the largest group the Border Patrol has ever encountered, according to the agency. ### EL PASO — On Wednesday, Border Patrol agents near downtown El Paso encountered a group of 1,036 migrants who had entered the country illegally — the biggest cluster the agency has ever seen. At one point in May, a holding cell designed for 35 migrants was crammed with 155. Six children have died in U.S. custody since September, three in the past month. ### And for May, officials said Thursday, apprehensions are expected to hit their highest level in more than a dozen years and “significantly surpass the record 109,000 in April,” said acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan. ### U.S. authorities are overstretched and overwhelmed by an unprecedented surge of Central American families arriving at the southern border. It is against that backdrop that President Donald Trump threatened this week to slap tariffs on goods from Mexico unless it cracks down on the flow of migrants. ### “It is certainly a crisis at this point, and it does not lend itself to quick fixes,” said Doris Meissner, who headed the former Immigration and Naturalization Service in the Clinton administration and is now a fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. ### Border Patrol arrests have jumped sharply over the last year but are still well below historic highs of the early 2000s. What’s different is the type of people crossing: Able-bodied Mexican men have been replaced by Central American families with children, many of them impelled to make the journey because of grinding poverty and violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. ### Juan Carlos Santos, 34, walked past the end of a bollard-style fence in New Mexico with his 9-year-old son, Yair, and was picked up by Border Patrol agents. On Friday, he was at the El Paso Greyhound station, bound for Washington, where he has a cousin who lent him money to pay a smuggler. ### Santos said he wanted to stay in Honduras but gave up after a year of unemployment. The farmworker hopes to bring his wife and 2-year-old daughter after paying his debt to his cousin. ### “There’s no work,” said Santos, who blamed drought and other factors for a decline in the corn and coffee fields he used to harvest. “Unemployment gets to you.” ### The surge has shown U.S. authorities to be woefully unprepared. ### The Department of Homeland Security’s internal watchdog reported Friday that during unannounced visits to El Paso in early May, it found a 125-person capacity holding facility had 700 people one day and 900 another day. They were packed in so tightly that some resorted to standing on toilets. ### Agents told investigators that some migrants were being held in standing-room-only conditions for days or weeks. ### “We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represents an immediate risk to the health and safety not just of the detainees, but also DHS agents and officers. Border Patrol management on site said there is a high incidence of illness among their staff,” the report said. ### Along the nearly 2,000-mile Mexican border, there were 98,777 arrests in April, nearly 7 out of 10 of them people who came as families or children traveling alone. Arrests are up from 38,243 a year earlier, when about 1 in 3 were members of families or unaccompanied children. ### El Paso offers the starkest illustration of the shifting landscape. Arrests there are up nearly 1,000 percent from a year earlier, and nearly 9 out of 10 are families or unaccompanied children. ### Migrants are increasingly coming in large groups. The Border Patrol said it has encountered more than 180 groups of over 100 people since October, compared with 13 in the previous 12-month period and two the year before. ### Meissner said the Trump administration’s tariff ultimatum is the latest in a series of dialed-up threats after several failures, including the practice of separating families at the border. ### “These shock-and-awe measures that this administration keeps trying to put into place every several months each time is making it worse,” she said. ### Meissner said people in Central America who are thinking of journeying to the U.S. are being told by smugglers and family members in this country: “You better come now. You never know what’s coming next.” ### Local ### Appointees to Longview boards, commissions announced ### jisaac                          / By Jimmy Daniell Isaac jisaac@news-journal.com ### 05.31.19",60119,1,"Michael Cavazos###The Hallsville High School graduation ceremony, on Friday May 31, 2019, at Bobcat Stadium.

He didn’t bump into another author also on book tour at the time, a person who appeared in his book but wouldn’t speak with him: now retired Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams. The book he was promoting? A Negotiator’s Cookbook — which included a recipe titled “The Peas Process,” the conceit being that these were the dishes he and other Republicans ate as they were negotiating the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement. ### “You couldn’t have scripted it,” says a laughing Keefe, 43, as we chat in the Library Bar at the Fairmont Royal York hotel in Toronto. “Mine was this book about these war crimes that he authorized. And his was a cookbook … nothing sticks to him.” ### Keefe’s book Say Nothing is the attempt to solve one of the best-known mysteries in the Northern Ireland Troubles: who killed Jean McConville? McConville, 38, a widowed mother of ten was taken from her flat in West Belfast by a group of people in 1972, and was never heard from again. (Her body was ultimately found in 2003.) She was one of 17 people who disappeared seemingly without a trace. ### Keefe’s interest in the story came about when he read, in 2013 in the New York Times, the obituary of a woman named Dolours Price. She had been part of the IRA, a hunger striker who, the obit writer said, had given interviews to an oral history project at Boston College. In those interviews she said Adams had ordered kidnappings and executions, as well as bombings in London, that she helped carry out. ### At the time Keefe, a staff writer for the New Yorker, was looking for a magazine article to write — and he had found it. “It was an initial look at the question of The Disappeared, and particularly the role that Gerry Adams might have played,” he says. ### ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ### It turned into much more — a book that navigated through the history of Northern Ireland from the late 60s to the present day. One that gave some context to the stories. A narrative that focused on the story of three people: McConville, Price, and Brendan Hughes (he also spoke to the Boston College project), all seminal figures in the Troubles. ### “What I wanted to do was focus really closely on this handful of people who happen to have these big outsized personalities and then let them be the guide through all this history,” Keefe explains. “And so what I kept thinking is I want it to be more like a novel, in which you follow the characters, and they see the history and you see the history as they saw it.” ### Which means you don’t get a lot of detail about Bloody Sunday, because Price, for example, wasn’t there. You also don’t get anything from the Unionist or Protestant point of view. What you do get is a compelling narrative that gives an opening into a history that might seem daunting. ### “I wanted to write something that somebody with zero interest in the Troubles as a subject could pick up and find ... the narrative would kind of pull them into the history in a way that a more orthodox history book might not,” Keefe says. ### And so McConville’s kidnapping draws us in from the first page; we get into the head of Price’s participation in the People’s Democracy March, one of the early incidents to spark the modern violence; we meet Brendan Hughes, a tactician responsible for planning many bomb attacks; Dolours’ sister Marian, who was side by side with her sister during much of the violence; and Adams who, although he never speaks to Keefe,  looms large. ### Once, in the early 2000s I was at a press conference in Northern Ireland when Al Hutchinson, a new chief of staff for the Oversight Commission on Decommissioning, was being announced. I mention this to Keefe, and note that a very well-regarded journalist asked the ex-Mountie Hutchinson: ‘You’re not from Northern Ireland … how are you going to understand the nuances of the politics here?’ ” ### Navigating that nuance without being overwhelmed by it and losing the story can be difficult. “I do think the nuances are part of the problem a lot of the time,” Keefe agrees. At first, he thought it would work against him that he was an outsider, but as he got closer to finishing the book, he says, his opinion changed; it helped, he thought, not to have any particular agenda or be “beholden” to any particular constituency. ### ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ### People spoke with him — he interviewed more than 100 people and visited Northern Ireland seven times in four years. For the most part he did not, however, see the Boston College interviews — they weren’t available to researchers, only to police (there’s another fascinating story in that). ### But the nuance manifests in other ways. McConville was ostensibly taken away and killed because she helped a British soldier. She became a martyr to some for doing that; for Price, Keefe notes, McConville seems a “scheming, conniving spy.” But others had helped British soldiers. Why had they not disappeared? ### It all depends on how you see it. And history is all about who tells it. ### Many things have happened since the book was published: Brexit, which threatens the border between Ireland and the U.K., is one; the murder of the 29-year-old Northern Ireland journalist, Lyra McKee, a member of the ‘post peace process’ generation, another. ### Echoing, perhaps unintentionally, a sentiment that people in Northern Ireland might think of as the norm, Keefe says in terms of Brexit “it was as if British voters just forgot about the Troubles. They forgot that that border had been this incredible source of pain and controversy and heartache.” ### The thing that Keefe says was particularly interesting to him was that “part of what my book was about was memory and forgetting. And part of what it was about was how the British have historically been quite dismissive of the Irish.” ### As the Good Friday Agreement (also sometimes called the Belfast Agreement) was signed in 1998 a generation has grown up in relative peace. They are the generation McKee called the “ceasefire babies,” those who lived with the fallout of the Troubles but wouldn’t experience the violence themselves. Yet a faction that calls themselves “the New IRA” claimed responsibility for her death. ### After the book came out, almost unbelievably, Keefe says he heard from many young people in England, but also in the Republic of Ireland who said that, growing up, Northern Ireland was like a foreign country to them. “It seems insane to me that you could grow up in Galway, you could be a 30-year-old in Galway today and not know.” ### If you can understand why Price and Hughes were against the peace agreement — they didn’t want a political settlement, they wanted the Brits out of Ireland — you can, perhaps, on a broader level understand why some of these old wounds are hard to heal. ### Still, Keefe didn’t want the book simply to be about one conflict; he wanted there to be a universality to the story. ### “Another my rules when I was writing this book was to not break the frame and talk about other conflicts, other times, other places, as much as I might want to. But, for instance, I wrote this book from 2014 to 2018. And the whole time I was thinking about veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. People my age who have PTSD, and did terrible things and saw terrible things happen. And they thought ‘You sent me over there because there were (weapons of mass destruction).’” ### It can be hard to move on after the conflict is over, if you felt you were led astray; if you felt as if your actions and suffering were for nothing. Throughout these decades, Gerry Adams was establishing Sinn Fein as a political arm, denying he’d ever been part of the IRA, denying that Sinn Fein was funded by the IRA but, in part, by “cake fairs.” ### In the book, Keefe writes, “This paradox would become a signature of Adams’s emerging persona: homespun whimsy mingled with armed insurrection, cake fairs with a dash of bloodshed.” ### In the story, there are plenty of people who felt left behind: the McConville family, Price, Hughes, and the many who aren’t mentioned. Those are histories that haven’t been heard, many people wouldn’t talk — Keefe quips “it’s called Say Nothing for a reason.” People are still worried about being called “touts” — the worse thing, as McConville’s case well illustrates, is to be seen to be a traitor. ### “There’s an image in the book which spoke to me very strongly. Brendan Hughes is an old guy living on benefits, going blind ... and he’s been essentially dismissed from the circle around Gerry Adams, because he has issues with the Good Friday Agreement. So he’s kind of a cast out. And he walks by his own image as a young man, a young hero on the wall.” ### By the end, Keefe reveals information about who was responsible for McConville’s death: who he thinks actually pulled the trigger (no spoiler here — but the person he names has denied it), pointed to who ordered the killings — Adams, who denies it — and left us with the feeling that, even now, there’s more story to tell. ### There are stories from the Unionist perspective that might be told, I suggest. Keefe shakes his head. “It’s a fascinating story,” he says, noting that there are plenty of people who write about the Troubles, who shared their work with him and who he cites in many endnotes. “I’m not going to be the professional Troubles guy.” ### Deborah Dundas is the Star’s Books editor.

But through the club’s highest points and its lowest of lows, ### Carlos Santana ### 's bat has remained a constant. ### With the score tied in the top of the fourth, Santana launched a solo homer to give the Indians a one-run lead. The blast, his team-leading eleventh of the year, was part of his two-hit afternoon in the Tribe’s 5-2 victory over the White Sox at Guaranteed Rate Field on Saturday afternoon. The victory, following Friday’s sloppy loss , prevented the Tribe from dropping to third place in the American League Central. ### • Box score ### “We made some mistakes today, but we played through them,” Indians manager Terry Francona said. “They kind of picked each other up. I know we’re not gonna be perfect. We’ve got some young guys and some inexperience, but I like the way that they came out with some energy and played a lot.” ### A single in the fourth inning extended Santana’s on-base streak, via hit or walk, to 18 games, dating back to May 14, a span in which the Indians have gone 8-10. But during that stretch, the Tribe’s No. 3 batter has hit .339 with 17 RBIs, 14 runs, 19 walks, six homers, five doubles, one triple and a 1.236 OPS. ### His long ball in the fourth inning was his hardest-hit homer, as tracked by Statcast, since Aug. 4 of last season (109.5 mph). Entering play on Saturday, Santana ranked second in the Majors in average exit velocity (a minimum of 150 batted ball events) at 93.5 mph, trailing only Pittsburgh’s ### Josh Bell ### (94.6 mph). The 33-year-old ranks in the 98th percentile in exit velocity and in the 96th percentile in percentage of hard-hit balls. ### “[Last year] I tried to pull all the time,” Santana said. “But this year my approach is of using all the field and not try too much. So, take it up the middle, make it my pitch and good swing.” ### Just how valuable has Santana been for the Indians? He currently leads the Tribe in the following categories: ### Average: .292 ### sacrifice fly was to give starter ### Jefry Rodriguez ### some early run support before the hurler was removed from the game after just four innings and 58 pitches with right lat tightness. He will receive an MRI and the team expects to know more on Sunday or Monday. ### “He had some shoulder tightness and he wanted to pitch like crazy and he fought us on it and none of us thought it was a good idea for somebody to go out there,” Francona said. “It doesn’t make any sense.” ### Rodriguez had allowed one run on two hits with three walks and three strikeouts, but his velocity started to dip as the afternoon went on. While Statcast was logging his pitches as changeups, the right-hander was actually throwing fastballs that were clocking in in the upper 80s on the radar gun. ### “I thought he competed like he always does,” Francona said. “He lost the plate a little bit with his fastball. Now to his credit, he really spun his breaking ball better than we’ve probably seen. But then we saw his velocity click down a couple. So we got him in between innings.” ### Staying scoreless ### Oliver Pérez ### relieved Rodriguez to start the fifth and worked a scoreless 1 2/3 innings. He has shut out opponents in 17 of his last 18 games (13 frames). Ten of those appearances have been hitless. ### “In my last couple years, I’ve been like a lefty specialist,” Perez said. “And, you know, you’ve just got to be ready for anything. For me, I’m available to pitch to righties and lefties. And a couple years ago, I was normally just facing like one lefty. But I can do anything. I’m prepared for anything. That’s a really good win for us.” ### Brad Hand ### came on in the ninth to continue his perfect save streak, converting his 16th of the season and extending his scoreless streak to seven innings in seven games. ### “[Hand] is one of the best,” Francona said. “We’re lucky to have him. It’s nice to know that you have a guy down there that’s waiting to pitch. He’s tremendous.” ### Mandy Bell covers the Indians for MLB.com.

16746,"Companies report progress on blood tests to detect cancer ###  ### By Marilynn MarchioneThe Associated Press ### Friday ### May 31, 2019 at 6:49 PM May 31, 2019 at 6:49 PM ### A California company says its experimental blood test was able to detect many types of cancer at an early stage and gave very few false alarms in a study that included people with and without the disease. ### Grail Inc. gave results in a news release on Friday and will report them Saturday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. They have not been published in a journal or reviewed by other scientists. ### Many companies are trying to develop early detection ""liquid biopsy"" tests that capture bits of DNA that cancer cells shed into blood. ### On Thursday, Johns Hopkins University scientists launched a company called Thrive Earlier Detection Corp. to develop its CancerSEEK test, which yielded results similar to Grail's more than a year ago. ### Grail is closely watched because of the extraordinary investment it's attracted — more than $1 billion from Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and other celebrities. ### The new results included 2,300 people, 60% with cancer and 40% not known to have it. The test detected 55% of known cancers and gave false alarms for 1%. The detection rate was better — 76% — for a dozen cancers that collectively account for nearly two-thirds of cancer deaths in the U.S., including lung, pancreatic, esophageal and ovarian. ### The test found only about a third of cancers at the very earliest stage but as many as 84% that had started to spread but not widely. ### It also suggested where the cancer may be in 94% of cases and was right about that 90% of the time. ### That's the most encouraging part because you don't want to tell people they may have cancer and then need to do a lot of other tests to figure out where, said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society. ### ""They still have a long way to go"" to prove the test's worth as a screening tool, but these results are encouraging, he said. ### Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, called the low rate of false alarms ""remarkable."" ### ""I have little doubt that in the next several years we're going to have what is probably a true early detection test,"" but the technology still needs to improve and to be tried in large groups of people without known cancers where the detection rate may not be as good, he said. ### The biggest question, he said, is ""will it make a difference in outcomes"" such as whether it helps people live longer, the ultimate measure of a screening test's worth. ### Grail's test has not been compared to mammography, colonoscopy or other screening tools and is not intended to replace them, said the company's chief scientific officer, Dr. Alex Aravanis. Many deadly cancers that the Grail test detected have no screening tests now, he noted. ### It's not clear what evidence the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would require to consider for approval. Sometimes tests can be sold through looser lab accreditation pathways rather than by seeking FDA approval. ### Grail and Thrive already have larger studies underway. ### ""We're not going to diagnose every cancer,"" but may not need to because so many are not found now until it's too late for effective treatment, said Dr. Minetta Liu, a Mayo Clinic cancer specialist who is presenting Grail's results at the cancer conference. ### Never miss a story ### Choose the plan that's right for you. ### Digital access or digital and print delivery.",60119,1,"###By Marilynn MarchioneThe Associated Press###Friday###May 31, 2019 at 6:49 PM May 31, 2019 at 6:49 PM###A California company says its experimental blood test was able to detect many types of cancer at an early stage and gave very few false alarms in a study that included people with and without the disease.###Grail Inc. gave results in a news release on Friday and will report them Saturday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago.

With runners at first and second, UM-Crookston’s Brock Reller drove a pitch out to right-center field for an RBI double. The Moo added two more runs in the inning to cut the deficit to 5-3. ### Fremont threatened in the top of the seventh, and was able to bring Reller to the plate representing the tying run with runners at first and second but Reller’s drive to center field hung up and was caught to end the threat. ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### LSU-Alexandria pitcher Kale Parks was handed the loss, his first of the season. ### In the second game, the Moo took advantage of several Pioneer defensive mistakes to build a 5-run lead at the top of the third inning thanks to two Wilson Ehrhardt home runs, giving him three home runs for the three-game series. ### The wheels fell off for Fremont in the bottom half of the inning, however, as the Pioneers stormed back to score five runs of their own and tied the score.

52333,"12 people killed in Virginia Beach shooting; suspect dead ### Police in Virginia Beach say a shooting at a municipal center left multiple people wounded. ### Friday, May 31st 2019, 2:21 PM PDT ### Updated: ### Friday, May 31st 2019, 10:22 PM PDT ### By BEN FINLEY ### Associated Press ### VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) - A longtime city employee opened fire in a municipal building in Virginia Beach on Friday, killing 12 people on three floors and sending terrified co-workers scrambling for cover before police shot and killed him following a ""long gun-battle,"" authorities said. ### Four other people were wounded in the shooting, including a police officer whose bulletproof vest saved his life, said Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera. The city's visibly shaken mayor, Bobby Dyer, called it ""the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach."" ### The shooting happened shortly after 4 p.m. when the veteran employee of the Public Utilities Department entered a building in the city's Municipal Center, and ""immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all of the victims,"" Cervera said. Authorities did not release the suspect's name, instead choosing to focus on the victims during a news conference. ### Police entered the building and got out as many employees as they could, then exchanged fire with the suspect, who was armed with a .45 caliber handgun, the chief said. ### Police initially said the gunman shot and killed 11 people, including one who was found inside a vehicle outside the municipal building. Cervera later said one more died on the way to the hospital. ### The shooting sent shock waves through Virginia Beach, the state's largest city and a popular vacation spot in southeastern Virginia. The building where the attack took place is in a suburban complex miles away from the high-rise hotels along the beach and the downtown business area. ### Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a statement he was devastated by the ""unspeakable, senseless violence,"" and is offering the state's full support to survivors and relatives of the victims. ### ""That they should be taken in this manner is the worst kind of tragedy,"" the governor said during the news conference. ### The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed and was monitoring the situation. ### Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting happened, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded herself and about 20 colleagues inside an office, pushing a desk against a door. ### ""We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,"" she said. ""We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn't real, like we were in a dream.

79537,"Companies report progress on blood tests to detect cancer ###  ### Friday ### May 31, 2019 at 10:15 PM ### A California company says its experimental blood test was able to detect many types of cancer at an early stage and gave very few false alarms in a study that included people with and without the disease. ### A California company says its experimental blood test was able to detect many types of cancer at an early stage and gave very few false alarms in a study that included people with and without the disease. ### Grail Inc. gave results in a news release on Friday and will report them Saturday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. They have not been published in a journal or reviewed by other scientists. ### Many companies are trying to develop early detection ""liquid biopsy"" tests that capture bits of DNA that cancer cells shed into blood. ### On Thursday, Johns Hopkins University scientists launched a company called Thrive Earlier Detection Corp. to develop its CancerSEEK test, which yielded results similar to Grail's more than a year ago. ### Grail is closely watched because of the extraordinary investment it's attracted — more than $1 billion from Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and other celebrities. ### The new results included 2,300 people, 60% with cancer and 40% not known to have it. The test detected 55% of known cancers and gave false alarms for 1%. The detection rate was better — 76% — for a dozen cancers that collectively account for nearly two thirds of cancer deaths in the U.S., including lung, pancreatic, esophageal and ovarian. ### The test found only about a third of cancers at the very earliest stage but as many as 84% that had started to spread but not widely. ### It also suggested where the cancer may be in 94% of cases and was right about that 90% of the time. ### That's the most encouraging part because you don't want to tell people they may have cancer and then need to do a lot of other tests to figure out where, said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the oncology society. ### ""They still have a long way to go"" to prove the test's worth as a screening tool, but these results are encouraging, he said. ### Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, called the low rate of false alarms ""remarkable."" ### ""I have little doubt that in the next several years we're going to have what is probably a true early detection test"" but the technology still needs to improve and to be tried in large groups of people without known cancers where the detection rate may not be as good, he said. ### The biggest question, he said, is ""will it make a difference in outcomes"" such as whether it helps people live longer, the ultimate measure of a screening test's worth. ### Grail's test has not been compared to mammography, colonoscopy or other screening tools and is not intended to replace them, said the company's chief scientific officer, Dr. Alex Aravanis. Many deadly cancers that the Grail test detected have no screening tests now, he noted. ### It's not clear what evidence the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would require to consider for approval. Sometimes tests can be sold through looser lab accreditation pathways rather than by seeking FDA approval. ### Grail and Thrive already have larger studies underway. ### ""We're not going to diagnose every cancer,"" but may not need to because so many are not found now until it's too late for effective treatment, said Dr. Minetta Liu, a Mayo Clinic cancer specialist who is presenting Grail's results at the cancer conference. ### Never miss a story ### Choose the plan that's right for you. ### Digital access or digital and print delivery.",60119,1,"The new results included 2,300 people, 60% with cancer and 40% not known to have it.

45973,"News - AP-National ### Arrest in 43-year-old murder case stuns Wisconsin town ### Investigators say they used genetic genealogy to connect an 82-year-old Wisconsin widower with five grown children to the 1976 killing of a young couple at a campsite. ### Saturday, June 1st 2019, 9:31 AM EDT ### Updated: ### Saturday, June 1st 2019, 1:32 PM EDT ### By IVAN MORENO ### Associated Press ### LAKEWOOD, Wis. (AP) - Word of the arrest - via a friend's text message - hit Wayne Sankey like a thunderbolt. ### ""I said, 'You gotta be kidding me,'"" Sankey recalled. ""And then I told the wife and she couldn't believe it. 'There's no way,' she said. 'Ray down the road?'"" ### AlertMe ### Ray Vannieuwenhoven was his next-door neighbor - a helpful, 82-year-old handyman with a gravelly voice and a loud, distinctive laugh, the kind of guy who always waved from his car. ### The widower and father of five grown children had lived quietly for two decades among the 800 residents of Lakewood, a northern Wisconsin town surrounded by forests and small lakes. ### Now authorities were saying this man was a cold-blooded killer. They had used genetic genealogy to crack a cold case that stretched back well into the 20th century - a double murder 25 miles southwest of Lakewood. ### For nearly 43 years, Vannieuwenoven had lived in plain sight, yet outside detectives' radar. ### It was just too much to be believed. Was the guy next door really a monster? ### ___ ### David Schuldes and Ellen Matheys, engaged to be married, set up their campsite at a secluded spot in McClintock Park on Friday afternoon, July 9, 1976. ### It appeared they were alone. ### Schuldes was a 25-year-old part-timer in the circulation department of the Green Bay Press-Gazette; Matheys, 24, worked at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay library. ### They were about to go for a walk, according to court documents and news reports of the time. First, Matheys stopped to use the restroom. ### Two shots from a .30-caliber rifle shattered the quiet. One bullet struck Schuldes' neck from 50 feet away, killing him instantly. The other bullet lodged in a bathroom wall. ### Matheys ran, with the killer in pursuit, investigators say. He caught and raped her, then shot her twice in the chest. ### Her body was found 200 yards from where Schuldes lay, a camera slung over his shoulder. ### Investigators were stumped: The killer took no money and left Matheys' purse in the couple's car. They didn't know why the couple was targeted, and leads were scant. For months, campers avoided McClintock Park. ### DNA profiling in the '90s brought new hope, but detectives got no matches when they submitted the semen from Matheys' shorts to the FBI's national database. ### Last year, detectives contacted Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a DNA technology company whose work with genetic genealogy analysis has helped police identify 55 suspects in cold cases nationwide since May 2018, according to the company. Parabon uploads DNA from crime scenes to GEDmatch, a free, public genealogy database with about 1.2 million profiles, all voluntarily submitted by people who've used consumer genealogy sites like Ancestry.com and 23andMe. ### California law enforcement used GEDmatch to capture the Golden State Killer last year by finding distant relatives and reverse-engineering his family tree. ### Parabon's experts completed Vannieuwenhoven's family tree in late December. They'd found his parents, who had lived in the Green Bay area. Now detectives needed DNA samples from Vannieuwenhoven and his three brothers. Two were ruled out with DNA samples collected from one brother's trash and another's used coffee cup. ### On March 6, two sheriff's deputies knocked on Vannieuwenhoven's door, pretending they wanted him to fill out a brief survey on area-policing. They told him to put the survey in an envelope and seal it with his tongue. ### Detectives didn't need to visit the fourth brother. Eight days later, Vannieuwenhoven was in custody. ### ___ ### At Vannieuwenhoven's first court appearance, on March 22, bond was set at $1 million. ### ""Not guilty, not guilty, not guilty,"" Vannieuwenhoven said, when the judge asked him if he understood the charges. His next court date is June 19. ### Kurt Schuldes, 68, a cousin of David Schuldes in Green Bay, welcomed the news of an arrest, but lamented the time it took: ""He just got away with it for way too long, unfortunately."" ### ""It was a long time coming,"" said Cynthia Chizek, Matheys' 53-year-old niece, who lives in Henderson, Nevada. ""It's just something that always hangs over your head, knowing that there's someone out there who did this heinous crime."" ### Prosecutors and Lakewood residents, meanwhile, were left with the question: Who is Raymand Lawrence Vannieuwenhoven? ### Richard Leurquin, twin brother of Vannieuwenhoven's dead wife, Rita, said his brother-in-law was ""a very loving father to his wife and kids."" He's convinced Vannieuwenhoven is innocent. ### The Vannieuwenhovens were married until her death in 2008, a few months after they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Sankey said after Rita died, Vannieuwenhoven spent his days fishing, hunting, and going on weeks-long camping trips. ### But Vannieuwenhoven had a dark side. To start, this isn't his first time in jail. ### In 1957, when he was 20, married, and going by the name Lawrence Vannieuwenhoven, he was jailed for six months for an unprovoked attack on a 17-year-old girl. She was walking with three friends when Vannieuwenhoven struck her on the back, face, and shoulder. Shortly before, police said, Vannieuwenhoven also tried to attack a 16-year-old girl. ### Vannieuwenhoven said before sentencing he ""was only trying to scare the girls,"" the Press-Gazette reported at the time. ### In 1960, he pleaded guilty to not providing financial support to his wife and their 1-year-old daughter, the Press-Gazette reported then. He was on probation for a year. ### More recently, some neighbors caught glimpses of a menacing side when he drank. He stopped only a few years ago, for his health, they said. ### ""I know this much - when he was drinking he was one son of a bitch. You didn't want to be anywhere near him when he was drinking. Not just me, a lot of people,"" said Fred Mason, 66, who works at the town dump where Vannieuwenhoven was seen frequently, rummaging through scrap piles for small engine parts. ### Robert Ganzell, 86, and his wife sometimes dined out with Vannieuwenhoven. He heard from others that he had a temper when he drank, but Ganzell said he never witnessed it. ### As for the murder charges, Ganzell was nonplussed. ""Never thought of it being him, doing anything like that,"" Ganzell said. Aside from that, he had little to say about Vannieuwenhoven. ### In fact, the neighbors realized that they knew little about this man. For instance, it's unclear where he worked before retiring. Sankey said he's heard Vannieuwenhoven was an iron worker, but he also told Sankey he used to haul and deliver boats. ### Sankey, 68, said he and his wife are still coming to terms with the allegations against their next-door neighbor, the guy who would occasionally repair his lawnmower or snow blower. ### ""People had the impression that he was a very good, normal person, just a retired guy,"" Sankey said. ""No matter where you went you'd mention Ray and they'd say, 'Oh yeah, old Ray.' That was basically about it. It's still hard to believe."" ### ___ ### Associated Press researchers Rhonda Shafner and Jennifer Farrar contributed from New York. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

89197,"Police say gunman killed 11 people in municipal building in Virginia Beach; suspect dead ### Written by Jim Morrison, Peter Hermann, and Justin Jouvenal ### The Washington Post ### VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. - A longtime municipal employee in Virginia Beach shot and killed 11 people Friday afternoon and injured several others inside a public works building before he was killed in an exchange of gunfire with police, city officials said at a news conference. ### Police Chief Kames Cervera said an officer was among the six wounded but was saved by his protective vest. He said the gunman, whom he did not identify, “fired indiscriminately” on several floors of the building, one of many in a complex near the center of the city. ### “This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,” Mayor Bobby Dyer said. “People involved friends, co-workers, neighbors, colleagues.” ### The shooting occurred about 4 p.m., near the end of the workday, as workers were winding down for the weekend. City Councilman Aaron Rouse Tweeted, “Pray for our City!” Councilman Aaron Rouse said, “This day will not define Virginia Beach ... We will come together.” ### Gov. Ralph Northam, who was en route to the city Friday night, called it a “tragic day for Virginia Beach and our entire Commonwealth. My heart breaks for the victims of this devastating shooting, their families, and all who loved them.” ### Megan Banton, who works in the public works building where the shooting occurred, said she was on the second floor of the building when her supervisor heard a loud noise and told people to go into her office. ### The sound of gunshots continued as about 20 people huddled on the floor after they barricaded the door with a desk. “We kept hearing gunfire,” Banton said. “We were trying to keep as quiet as possible.” ### She said some people in the office were crying; others appeared nervous and some were just silent. ### Relatives of victims were told to gather at a middle school for updates, even as representatives from the medical examiner’s office were headed to the scene. Police and other public safety workers were busy processing the vast crime scene and trying to identify the victims Friday night and were expected to be there into Saturday. ### Conditions of the surviving victims were not immediately available; five patients were sent to Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital and one was taken to Sentara Princess Anne Hospital. ### Banton, the employee who was on the second floor of the public works building, said she has an 11-month-old baby boy at home and she sat wondering if she would ever see him again. ### “You never think this is going to happen to you. When it happens to you, it’s totally different,” Banton said. ### Sheila Cook, who was in the court house building in the complex, told a local television news station she heard muffled gunshots but knew it wasn’t in her building. She said police acted quickly in telling people that they were safe after the shooter had been apprehended. ### “That was enough to make me feel safe enough to come outside and that God was with us,” she said.

100283,"United’s Ike Opara not ready to dish on Sporting KC ### By Andy Greder / St. Paul Pioneer Press on May 31, 2019  at 8:39 p.m. ### Minnesota United defender Ike Opara (3) looks on during the second half against Seattle Sounders May 4, 2019, at Allianz Field. Brace Hemmelgarn / USA TODAY Sports ### ST. PAUL -- When Ozzie Alonso and Ethan Finlay played their former clubs for the first time this season, Ike Opara said he’d have something to say when he was in the same spot — mid-August, when Sporting Kansas City was next on the schedule. ### Turns out, the reunion will be sooner than expected. ### On Thursday, Minnesota United’s new center back learned his former club will be the Loons’ opponent in a fourth-round U.S. Open Cup match on June 12. ### Still, Opara wasn’t ready to share his feelings this week — at least not publicly. ### “It will be good to see them,” said Opara, who became one of Major League Soccer’s best defenders during six seasons in Kansas. “I’m sure leading up to that game there will be a lot of comments and banter, especially privately.” ### The Loons will be playing Sporting for the fourth time in the past six national tournaments, all Kansas City victories. ### Alonso and Opara still have to play their former clubs on the road this season. Opara and the Loons go to Kansas on Aug. 22, and Alonso returns to Seattle on Oct. 6, when Minnesota expects to be jockeying for a playoff spot in the regular-season finale. ### Thiesson back ### Former United fullback and fan favorite Jerome Thiesson will return to Minnesota for Sunday’s game against the Philadelphia Union. ### From the snow-filled first MLS game in Minnesota in 2017 and into last season, Thiesson was a mainstay on United’s back line, playing 36 straight games. He scored twice and had four assists in 47 career games and played the 2019 season with Raperswil-Jona in his native Switzerland. ### News of Thiesson’s homecoming lit up #MNUFC Twitter on Friday, and invitations went out for him to get on the “capo” stand to help lead chants and songs in front of the Wonderwall in the South stand at Allianz Field. ### Thiesson told friend and former teammate Abu Daladi he doesn’t need a comp ticket and plans to be in that supporters groups’ section. Danladi said he used to eat lunch at Thiesson’s home lunch every Wednesday. They plan on going out to dinner during Thiesson’s trip. ### “Very, very close with them,” Danladi said of Thiesson’s family. “Really excited to see him. I haven’t seen him in a while.” ### Straight cash ### Jan Gregus has paid Vito Mannone, but not for their bet on whether teammate Romain Metanire would score a goal — which the defender did it in Saturday’s 1-0 win over the Houston Dynamo. ### Gregus has been tipping Mannone when he gets a shutout, and United’s goalkeeper now has five clean sheets this season — tying a club record. So Mannone isn’t clamoring for his bet payment. ### “I say, ‘What if Romain scores?’ ” Mannone said. “(Gregus) said, ‘OK, I’ll pay you a big amount.’ … He didn’t expect it and Romain scores. But it was a joke.” ### Metanire remains ### Metanire won’t leave to play in the Madagascar national team’s friendly match against Luxembourg on Sunday and will be available for Sunday’s United game against the Union. After sitting out Wednesday’s 1-0 loss to Atlanta because of yellow card accumulation, Metanire will be a boost to United’s lineup. ### Briefly ### Kevin Molino returned to training Friday after suffering a left hamstring injury in a 1-0 loss to Hertha Berlin on May 22. Coach Adrian Heath said the Trinidad and Tobago midfielder might be available off the bench Sunday. … Metanire, Molino, Gregus and Rasmus Schuller have upcoming national team duties. Gregus (Slovakia) and Schuller (Finland) are expected to leave soon after Sunday’s game. … Heath said he did not talk to Professional Referee Organization General Manager Howard Webb about the decision not to take another look at the Loons’ questionable no-goal ruling Wednesday. ### Additional Articles Recommended by The Dickinson Press",60119,1,"“ Very, very close with them,” Danladi said of Thiesson’s family. “ Really excited to see him.

I think he would be excellent. ### “I have always liked him. I don’t know that he is going to be chosen, but I think he is a very good guy, a very talented person.” ### He added that several candidates in the Conservative leadership race had asked for his support, without revealing who. ### A key Leave campaigner in the Brexit referendum, Johnson has said he is prepared to take Britain out of the European Union, “deal or no deal”. ### In the interview, Trump also repeated his criticism of how May has handled Brexit negotiations, saying Britain had allowed the EU to “have all the cards”. ### “It is very hard to play well when one side has all the advantage,” he said. “I had mentioned to Theresa that you have got to build up your ammunition.” ### May concluded a divorce agreement with the EU in November but her deal was rejected three times by the British parliament, forcing her to seek a delay in leaving the bloc, now scheduled for October 31. ### – ‘Nasty’ Meghan – ### Commenting on Britain’s domestic politics and opining on ruling-party leadership choices at a sensitive time would normally be an unusual move for a US president — but not for Trump, a former reality-TV star who often speaks his mind. ### It could however add to tensions during Trump’s three-day visit to Britain. ### Trump is to be received in Buckingham Palace on Monday by Queen Elizabeth II. ### He will then have a discussion with Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne who is known for speaking out against global warming — an issue Trump is dismissive of. The president has decided to pull the US out of the Paris climate change agreement that seeks to curb carbon emissions. ### A meeting with Meghan, the former US actress who married Charles’s second son Prince Harry, is not on the agenda for Trump, whom she criticised during his 2016 campaign to be America’s leader. ### “What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty,” Trump said of Meghan, though he also said he was “sure she will do excellently” as a princess. ### As for protests that are expected to dog Trump’s state visit, the president insisted “I think I am really — I hope — I am really loved in the UK”. ### Source: AFP",60119,1,"– ‘ Nasty’ Meghan –###Commenting on Britain’s domestic politics and opining on ruling-party leadership choices at a sensitive time would normally be an unusual move for a US president — but not for Trump, a former reality-TV star who often speaks his mind.###It could however add to tensions during Trump’s three-day visit to Britain.###Trump is to be received in Buckingham Palace on Monday by Queen Elizabeth II.","[28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]","<p>– ‘ Nasty’ Meghan –</p><p>Commenting on Britain’s domestic politics and opining on ruling-party leadership choices at a sensitive time would normally be an unusual move for a US president — but not for Trump, a former reality-TV star who often speaks his mind.</p><p>It could however add to tensions during Trump’s three-day visit to Britain.</p><p>Trump is to be received in Buckingham Palace on Monday by Queen Elizabeth II.</p>",1067

(AP) — The American photographer who shot the iconic image of a man standing in front of tanks at the 1989 Tiananmen protests says it's time for the Chinese government to come clean about the bloody events of 30 years ago. ### Jeff Widener was an Associated Press photo editor based in Bangkok when he was called in to help cover a growing student-led pro-democracy movement centered on Beijing's Tiananmen Square. ### The day after the military crushed the protests on June 3-4, Widener took the shot of an unknown man holding shopping bags facing a row of tanks. The photo of ""tank man"" became one of the most famous images of defiance of the 20th century. ### In an interview, Widener said he doesn't understand why China's leaders won't admit to errors made and reveal the truth behind the crackdown. ### ""The United States and European countries have made mistakes throughout history and they've reconciled those problems,"" Widener told AP. ### ""I think it's time for China to move forward and just come clean on what happened, report to the family members what happened to their loved ones so that they can put this to rest,"" he said. ""I think that's the right, decent thing to do."" ### The 62-year-old Californian developed a love of photography at a young age, eventually joining AP as Southeast Asia picture editor. ### Rejected for a journalist visa at the Chinese Consulate in Bangkok, he flew to Hong Kong, where he got a tourist visa through a travel agency, and made it through customs in Beijing with a mobile darkroom in his luggage. ### With the protests in full swing, he developed a daily routine of riding a bicycle early in the morning to Tiananmen Square, where thousands of students were camped out. ### His May 30, 1989, photo captured the ""Goddess of Democracy,"" the students' version of the Statue of Liberty, facing the portrait of Communist China's first leader, Mao Zedong, on the massive Tiananmen gate. ### ""So you had this democracy facing off with Communism that was quite striking,"" Widener said. ### Soon, the mood began to change. After the government declared martial law, Beijing residents blocked roads to prevent troops — at that time unarmed — from moving toward the square. ### That enraged party elders led by China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, steeling their determination to end the protests by military means. ### On the night of June 3, Widener rode to the square with AP reporter Dan Biers, just as the People's Liberation Army began fighting its way eastward through barricades and crowds of protesters. ### He suffered a serious head injury from a flying piece of asphalt, but made it back to the AP bureau and his hotel. ### Widener emerged the following afternoon to find rock-strewn streets, burnt-out vehicles and a population dazed by the violence deployed against them by the government. ### Asked to get a shot of military forces occupying the square, Widener headed to the Beijing Hotel, which had vantage points close to the action, even as gunfire continued to pop from parts of the city. ### There, he met an American college exchange student, Kirk Martsen, who would play a key role in the tank man tale. Martsen acted as if he and Widener were old friends, allowing the photographer to slip past security men guarding the hotel entrance. ### Martsen had a room on the hotel's sixth floor facing the street, to which he gave Widener access. The problem though, was film. Widener had run out and there was no way to go back to the AP bureau to get more. ### Martsen went hunting among the frightened tourists in the lobby, returning two hours later with a single roll that would prove crucial in the events that followed. ### Widener stayed overnight, and early on June 5, he rushed to the balcony upon hearing the sound of approaching tanks. ### ""I started to take a photograph and a guy walks out with shopping bags and I'm thinking to myself, 'you know this guy's going to mess up my photograph,"" he said. ""I mean it really was like I wasn't thinking clearly."" ### ""So I just watched him and waited. But they didn't shoot him. So I thought you know I need a closer shot,"" he said. ### The man moved at least twice to block the tanks and climbed on the turret of one to converse with a crew member. Eventually, he was whisked from the scene by two men in blue, whose identities, like that of the man himself, have never been revealed. ### At least five photographers as well as videographers shot the scene, but Widener's version became by far the most famous. The photo made him a Pulitzer Prize finalist and was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential images of all time. ### ___",60119,1,""" So I just watched him and waited.

73361,"Published: 4:32 PM EDT May 31, 2019 ### Updated: 6:38 PM EDT June 1, 2019 ### 6:30 p.m., June 1 ### Four were engineers who worked to maintain streets and protect wetlands. Three were right-of-way agents who reviewed property lines. The others included an account clerk, a technician, an administrative assistant, and a special projects coordinator. In all, they had served the city of Virginia Beach for more than 150 years. ### These 11 city employees and one contractor were wiped out Friday when a fellow city worker opened fire inside a municipal building. A day after the shooting, city officials sought to honor them by sharing their job titles and years of service in a somber slideshow. ### ""They leave a void that we will never be able to fill,"" said City Manager Dave Hansen, who had worked for years with many of the dead. ### Police Chief James Cervera identified the assailant as DeWayne Craddock, who had been employed for 15 years as an engineer with the city's utilities department. He declined to comment on a motive for the rampage, which ended with Craddock's death in a gun battle with officers. City officials uttered his name just once and said they would not mention it again. ### Joseph Scott, an engineering technician with the utilities department, said he had worked with Craddock and had a brief interaction with him Friday, passing him in the men's restroom about five minutes before the shooting. ### ""He was in there brushing his teeth, which he always did after he ate,"" Scott said. ""I said 'Hey, how you doing? What are you doing this weekend?' It was just a brief conversation."" ### Scott said he left for the day right after and learned of the shooting when a co-worker and then his son called him asking if he was OK. ### ""I couldn't believe that it happened,"" he said. ### One of the dead employees had worked for the city for 41 years. Six worked in the same department as Craddock, though authorities have declined to say if anyone was specifically targeted or if the suspect had issued threats before. The victims were found throughout the building, on three floors, police said. ### The municipal building was open to the public, but security passes were required to enter inner offices, conference rooms and other work areas. As a current employee, Craddock would have had the pass to enter the inner offices, Hansen said. ### In response to a reporter's question, Cervera said the gunman had not been fired. ### One of the dead, Christopher Kelly Rapp of Powhatan, enjoyed Scottish music and joined a pipe band last fall. He played with the group in October during a Celtic festival in Virginia and marched with bandmates on St. Patrick's Day. ### ""Chris was reserved but very friendly, quietly engaging members one-on-one after our weekly practices,"" the band, Tidewater Pipes & Drums, said in a statement. ### Another victim, Mary Louise Gayle of Virginia Beach, was described as a ""super sweet lady"" who always had a big smile. ""She would always be out there in the yard, working on something and talking to my daughters,"" John Cushman, Gayle's next-door neighbor, told The New York Times. ### The other employees who were killed were identified as Tara Welch Gallagher, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A. Nixon, Ryan Keith Cox, Joshua O. Hardy and Michelle ""Missy"" Langer, all of Virginia Beach; Laquita C. Brown and Robert ""Bobby"" Williams, both of Chesapeake; and Richard H. Nettleton of Norfolk. The 12th victim, Herbert ""Bert"" Snelling of Virginia Beach, was a contractor who was in the building to seek a permit. ### The police and fire departments were to assign members of their honor guards to help each victim's family. ### 4:30 p.m., June 1 ### An official with the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives says investigators have identified two .45 caliber pistols used in the shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building that killed 12. ### Speaking at a news conference Saturday afternoon, ATF regional special agent Ashan Benedict says all indications are that the guns were bought legally. He says one gun was bought in 2016 and the other was bought last year. ### Benedict says two other weapons were found at the gunman's home. ### Meanwhile, President Donald Trump ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff in memory of the victims. ### Trump said in a statement released by the White House on Saturday that he was ordering the action as a ""mark of solemn respect for the victims of the terrible act of violence"" on Friday. ### Three victims who survived the shooting remain hospitalized with serious injuries at Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital. ### Dr. Martin O'Grady told a news conference Saturday that one patient had just gotten out of surgery and another patient faced repeated operations for wounds inflicted when a gunman opened fire at a municipal building in Virginia Beach. ### O'Grady is head of the hospital trauma unit. He said two of the patients being treated at the hospital had sustained ""significant"" injuries but were expected to survive. He described a third patient's injuries as ""devastating."" He would not elaborate due to health care privacy laws. ### Authorities said earlier that a fourth patient was receiving treatment at a hospital in Norfolk. ### PHOTOS: Vigil held for Virginia Beach municipal center shooting ### 01 / 16 ### 16 / 16 ### 11:44 a.m., June 1 ### Gov.

And we must remember they all had families they all had loved ones, they were parents, they were daughters, sisters, brothers — and now there's a void in their families."" ###  ### The Norfolk FBI is asking the public for information about the shooting. ### 8:30 a.m., June 1 ### All but one of the 12 victims were employees for the city of Virginia Beach, according to Virginia Beach City Manager Dave Hansen at a Saturday morning press conference. ### The victims: ### Brown was a right-of-way agent in public works for 4.5 years. ### 2:16 a.m., June 1 ### ABC News said two law enforcement officials who'd been briefed on the investigation said DeWayne Craddock recently was fired from his position as a city employee. ### ---------- ### Virginia Beach Police say 12 people are dead following a shooting at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center. The suspected shooter is also dead following a shootout with police. ### Virginia Beach Police Chief Jim Cervera said the suspect was a current, longtime employee of Virginia Beach Public Utilities who opened fire and shot ""indiscriminately"" at workers inside an operations building in the Virginia Beach Municipal Center on Friday afternoon. ### RELATED: Witnesses recall moments of deadly shooting at Virginia Beach Municipal Center ### Chief Cervera initially said there were 11 victims killed total, in addition to the suspected gunman who was killed by police in a shootout.

Suddenly in the next lane an Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officer on a motorcycle comes zipping by, escorting someone else who is just too important to be sitting in an idling vehicle like you are.Maybe they are that important. It could be the governor. Perhaps one of the drivers or team members. Maybe it’s the archbishop, who has to get there on time to deliver the blessing. Or a busload of band members who parade around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway before the race begins.Or it might just be some richer person than you. Someone who was able to buy a package that includes a police escort to the track — a police officer who is on duty and being paid with your tax dollars. ### After the 2018 Indy 500 — an event I love despite the fact that I know next to nothing about auto racing in general — I began to wonder who got these coveted police escorts. I contacted IMPD last May 29 asking who could get escorts, who paid for them, the duty status of the officers conducting them and how many got them. ### It took several emails and nearly two months to get an answer. On July 25, a public affairs officer for IMPD informed me in an email that escorts are set up “for many people or organizations to include but not limited to” the following groups: ### Local, state and federal officials ### Military ### Sports celebrities and “politically associated persons important to the city” ### “Longtime community partners that benefit the city/department; police foundation, IMPD motorcycle drill team, PAL (the Police Action League) etc.” ### Families of officers working the event ### Drivers and their families ### Medical personnel ### Media ### I was told that that year about 50 on-duty police officers conducted escorts for about 330 groups or individuals, and that the department does not accept payment for the escorts. ### I responded the next day, thanking him for the information but saying I found it only partially answered my inquiry, since he had said those getting escorts were not limited to the categories listed. So, I asked for the list of exactly who got them. ### I’ve never heard back. An email and phone call this week to prod an answer also went unacknowledged. ### This may be why: Google Indy 500 and police escorts and you will find tour promoters selling VIP packages for hundreds of dollars, even thousands, that include police escorts. ### Let me be clear: My complaint is not with the police officers themselves. They do a hard, often thankless job, putting their lives at risk to keep this city safe. The police I have known over the years are dedicated citizens who often go above and beyond to protect us, to make our neighborhoods better places. And they do it working long hours for inadequate pay. ### But they should not be assigned — on duty, at taxpayer expense — to help a private business make a profit off of tour packages. They work for all of us, not the privileged few. And I’m not thrilled either with politicians who have no official function at the track and who likely are already whooping it up on some lobbyist’s expense account in a suite getting a fast lane to the track, happy to be zipping by all the chumps who are their voters. ### Indianapolis has a crime problem. In 2018, for the fourth year in a row, we set a record for homicides, with 156 and we show no signs of slowing that sad statistic this year. Yes, the race and its adjacent activities are just a few days in May. But with a tight city budget and numerous unmet city challenges — from potholes to blighted housing to drugs — this is a waste of manpower and resources. ### A few years ago, the city bus service was forced to stop race day shuttles to the track due to a lawsuit. It took away a favored way for many to go the track, and likely increased the traffic jams.

46204,"Chicago Police Release Jussie Smollett's Criminal Case Files! 'Empire' Star Called Osundairo Brothers 'Black As Sin', Texted For Drugs, Police Told NOT To Investigate ### May 31 | by _YBF ### The files Jussie Smollett tried to keep under wraps have been released and we've learned quite a few new things about his criminal case. Get it all inside... ### Jussie Smollett tried his damnedest to keep the case files in his criminal case sealed. However, a Cook County judge didn't feel like his actions warranted to have the files sealed, so, he ordered the file to be released. And here we are. ### Cook County Judge Steven Watkins said the former ""Empire"" star didn't have a right to privacy in the case since he and his lawyers were so vocal about the case in the media. ### ""These are not the actions of a person seeking to maintain his privacy or simply be let alone,"" he said in his order, referring to Smollett's lawyers media tour after the charges were dropped. ###  ### and his attorney's went on TV to discuss the case. ### Judge:  ""These are not the actions of a person seeking to maintain his privacy or simply be let alone."" pic.twitter.com/hwrhjYP3AO ### — Charlie De Mar (@CharlieDeMar) May 23, 2019 ###  ### Judge Watkins noted there were good arguments in favor of keeping the file sealed, however, Jussie forfeited his right to privacy by speaking to the media before and after the charges against him were dropped.  As you know, the 36-year-old actor was hit with 16 felony counts of lying to police after he filed a police report saying he had been the victim of a racist, homophobic attack in January. He was booked and released on a $10,000 bond in April. ### All 470 pages of the criminal case were released and here's what we've learned: ### According to the report ( obtained by The Daily Mail), Jussie changed his story throughout the investigation, first telling police his attackers were white. He then said they were ""pale"" and admitted he assumed they were white because of what he claimed they yelled at him: ""This is MAGA country.""  He said the attacker had ""pale"" skin, which he could see behind the mask he was wearing - around the eyes. ### After brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo (above) were arrested in connection to the attack, Jussie appeared shocked and explained to police why the brothers couldn't have been his attackers, saying ""It can't be them, they'e black as sin."" ### He said he and the brothers were friends and had no problems. He originally agreed to press charges against them, but was reportedly stopped by his lawyer. ### It has been revealed that Jussie sent several text messages to the Nigerian brothers asking for drugs months before the alleged attack. He exchanged several text messages with Abel Osundairo about getting ""molly,"" ""pills,"" and ""Whitney,"" which was a code name for cocaine. ### It's reported several line-ups were put together, but Jussie's lawyer did not let him do any. It's unclear if Jussie ever viewed a line up that included the brothers since the case files were so largely redacted. ### Some of the files still remain a secret, including exactly what the brothers said in their interviews, which the police department expects to release next week. ### Immediately after the attack, Jussie changed his phone number. In earlier interviews, he told police he had only spoken to his manager and creative director on the night of the attack, but records show she spoke with Abel and Ola Osundairo in the hours and days after the January 29 incident. ### Weeks before the 16 charges were dropped against Jussie, the Chicago Police Department was reportedly told by Cook County prosecutors to end the criminal investigation into the alleged hate crime, the newly released documents show. They were told a deal was in the works. ### NBC News reports : ### In the documents released Thursday, detectives note the Chicago Police Department was informed by the Cook County State's Attorney's office on Feb. 28 that they could no longer investigate the crime. Smollett was indicted on March 7. The lead investigators in the case met with Assistant State's Attorney Risa Lanier, who informed detectives ""that she felt the case would be settled with Smollett paying the city of Chicago $10,000 in restitution and doing community service."" ### “Detectives were not aware that the case was going to be handled in the manner that it was,"" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. ""If you go on to read the report, the detective writes that the case will be closed through arrest and prosecution.” ### The detectives closed the case at that point because an arrest was made and the alleged offender was being prosecuted, according to Guglielmi. ### Interesting. ### The City of Chicago is suing Jussie Smollett for $130,000 to cover the costs of the investigation.",60119,1,"Immediately after the attack, Jussie changed his phone number.

Palmer breaking through sea ice during its southward transit toward Thwaites Glacier. ### Credit: Carolyn Beeler/The World ### RSS ### In our first story, we take listeners to a place where no human has been before. Reporter Carolyn Beeler boards an icebreaker to sail along the face of Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier. If Thwaites collapses, it could cause 2 feet of global sea level rise. But glaciologists fear the consequences could also be much worse: Thwaites may be holding back the entire West Antarctic ice sheet, almost like a cork in a wine bottle. If it crumbles into the ocean, the results could be catastrophic. ### For our second story, reporter Michael de Yoanna travels to a military radar site in Alaska’s Bering Strait. It’s part of a network of military radars designed to monitor a million miles of airspace around the United States and Canada, guarding against Russian long-range bombers and missiles. Now, though, some of these radars are facing new foes like ice melt, erosion and storm surge. We investigate how climate change is affecting U.S. national security, and how potential foreign adversaries like Russia are preparing to take advantage of it. ### Our final story looks at Kivalina, an Alaska Native village above the Arctic Circle. Melting sea ice and storm surge will likely put Kivalina underwater. In fact, the Army Corps of Engineers says it could happen by 2025. With the lives of residents hanging in the balance, reporter Emily Schwing looks into why efforts to relocate Kivalina keep failing, and whether state and federal agencies are equipped to support climate change refugees. ### Credits ### Our Partners ### The story from Antarctica was produced by Carolyn Beeler, an environment reporter at PRI’s The World.

Photograph: Paola deGrenet/The Observer ### The protagonist of Jessica Andrews’s debut novel is a young woman trying to carve out a place in the world. Lucy moves from Sunderland to university in London, struggles to fit in and survive financially, and then, after graduation, retreats to her late grandfather’s cottage in Ireland. It’s a standard coming-of-age narrative, but also features something very rare in literary fiction: a working-class heroine, written by a young working-class author. ### The story is told in numbered fragments, a modish narrative device that doesn’t always work. Saltwater is billed as “for fans of Sally Rooney and Olivia Laing”, but Andrews has little in common with either. You can draw a much stronger line to Sara Baume, whose novel A Line Made By Walking follows a young woman’s breakdown in another Irish cottage, or Jenny Offil’s Dept of Speculation , a masterpiece of the disjointed form. In Saltwater’s case, the fragments suit the protagonist’s youth: though the existence of the internet is barely acknowledged, Lucy is of a generation raised by social media, a medium comprised of brief chunks of text devoted to self-exposure. At the same time, the structure mimics the nature of memory. ### The writing is disarmingly honest – sometimes, when it comes to Lucy’s relationship with her mother, uncomfortably so This is a courageous book dealing frankly with youth, puberty, mother-daughter relationships, class, disability and alcoholism. There are difficult truths, but no wallowing. ### The brevity of the segments helps to break up the emotional intensity, while stories and anecdotes from Lucy’s upbringing relieve the adolescent angst. This is where the novel shines, in Andrews’s descriptions of Lucy’s friends and family, especially her single mum, her brother, who is born profoundly deaf, and her neighbourhood. Of her grandmother, she writes: “Everything about her was silver; her voice as she sang along to the radio in the mornings, the shiny fish scales caught on her tabard at the end of the day.” In Washington, Sunderland, “Boys at school knew the factory was looming over their future, waiting for them to grow into the overalls.” ### There were times when I wanted to hear more about the other characters, but then the entire project is devoted to one young woman’s subjectivity. There is little dialogue, but if the interiority can occasionally feel wearing, it is worth it for its refreshing perspective. Lucy feels the acute tension and anxiety that arises between leaving your community and staying. I found parts of this novel intensely moving – I wish I had read it when I was 19. For those who leave, it will be a balm to know they are not alone. For those who stay, Saltwater tells you there is life elsewhere, but that finding it can tear your heart in two. ### • Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett’s The Tyranny of Lost Things is published by Sandstone.

26117,"ePaper ### Just In ### The many biases of facial recognition tools ### June 01, 2019 18:04 IST ### Updated: ### June 01, 2019 18:05 IST ### Share Article ### June 01, 2019 18:04 IST ### Updated: ### June 01, 2019 18:05 IST ### more-in ### Despatches ### There has been growing concern about the use of facial recognition in the U.S. ### Last month, San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors, in an 8-1 vote, banned the use of facial recognition technology by local agencies. The liberal city is the first in America to pass such a law — especially significant given that San Francisco is also the beating heart of the tech universe. There has been growing concern about the use of facial recognition in the U.S. and talk about it is particularly noticeable, given that the U.S. is in the midst of taking China to task for the extraordinary surveillance it conducts on its Uighur Muslim minority. ### More than 50 agencies across the country use, or have used, facial recognition technology for ID checks or to identify criminals, The Washington Post reported. This has raised not only concerns around privacy but also around accuracy and bias. Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reported that it tested Rekognition — Amazon’s controversial facial recognition tool — and was able to (incorrectly) match mugshots of those who have been arrested for a crime with those of 28 members of the U.S. Congress. Racial minorities were disproportionally represented in the set of mismatches. ### An MIT Media Lab study found that facial recognition misclassified women as men 19% of the time and the error rate got worse, to 31%, for darker skin, as per The New York Times. ### Civil rights concerns ### The ACLU and a group of other similar organisations wrote to Jeff Bezos in May 2018 requesting that Amazon stop selling its facial recognition technology to law enforcement agencies. But technology companies are pushing back to varying degrees, and Amazon is chief among those resisting curbs on the technology. Last month, it was revealed that just 2.4% of Amazon shareholders voted for a proposal to stop the sale of facial recognition technology to government agencies, and just 27.5% supported a proposal to study the civil rights implications of Rekognition. ### At the moment, there are no federal laws governing the use of the technology, so there is broad scope for companies and subnational governments to do as they please, unless specific laws like the one in San Francisco limit the technology’s use. ### In March, Buzzfeed News reported that the U.S. Customs and Border Police (CBP) is planning to scan the faces of passengers on 16,300 flights per week (or 100 million passengers) going abroad within two years. This is 100% of all passengers at the top 20 airports in the U.S. ### Buzzfeed reported that the images of departing non-citizens could be retained for up to 14 days and used in “evaluation of the technology” and “assurance of the accuracy of the algorithms”. In other words, the images could be used to train the facial recognition AI tool. The images of non-citizens can be retained for up to 75 years, the report said. ### Congress has authorised the collection of biometrics of non-citizens but the legality of collecting citizens’ facial data stands on a much flimsier ground. This is on the top of the known inaccuracies of the system. ### However, the situation is starting to show signs of change. On May 22, the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee held a hearing on the impact of facial recognition technology on civil rights and liberties. The cause brought Republicans and Democrats together, a rare event in Washington these days. ### “You’ve hit the sweet spot that brings progressives and conservatives together,” said Mark Meadows, a Republican Congressman. ### “So what demographic is this [facial recognition] most effective on?” freshman Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked. ### “White men,” said Joy Buolamwini, founder of Algorithmic Justice League, an organisation that fights bias in codes and algorithms. ### “And who are the primary engineers and designers of these algorithms?” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez asked. “Definitely white men,” said Ms. Buolamwini, going on to describe the possibility of using facial recognition technology on body-worn cameras used by the police. In a system already fraught with racial bias, Ms. Buolamwini said, technology can exacerbate the challenges. ### The hearing is only an early step in what will have to be a substantial but quick journey if the law is to catch up with and regulate the burgeoning use of facial recognition. ### (Sriram Lakshman is The Hindu’s Washington correspondent.) ### SUBSCRIBE TO OUR DAILY NEWSLETTER ### Submit",60119,1,"Updated:###June 01, 2019 18:05 IST###Share Article###June 01, 2019 18:04 IST###Updated:","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]","<p>Updated:</p><p>June 01, 2019 18:05 IST</p><p>Share Article</p><p>June 01, 2019 18:04 IST</p><p>Updated:</p>",1080
16175,"Tweet ### AMC is now among many entertainment companies who are moving or considering moving their production efforts out of Georgia if an anti-abortion law comes into effect.

7078,"Trump gets pushback on promise of new Mexican tariffs ###  ### Friday ### May 31, 2019 at 3:30 PM ### U.S. manufacturers said the tariff, set to take effect June 10, would have devastating consequences on them and American consumers. U.S. stocks tumbled on Wall Street in response to Trump's planned action. ### WASHINGTON — Despite pushback from U.S. business, Mexico and Capitol Hill, President Donald Trump doubled down Friday on his threat to slap a 5% tariff on Mexican imports unless America's southern neighbor cracks down on Central American migrants trying to cross the U.S. border. ### U.S. manufacturers said the tariff, set to take effect June 10, would have devastating consequences on them and American consumers. U.S. stocks tumbled on Wall Street in response to Trump's planned action. ### ""Imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico is exactly the wrong move,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is exploring legal action in response to the tariffs. ""These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border. Instead, Congress and the president need to work together to address the serious problems at the border."" ### Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador dispatched his foreign secretary to Washington to try to negotiate a solution. He said social problems are not solved with coercive measures, but also seemed convinced that Trump just needed to be informed about all the steps Mexico has taken to slow illegal migration. ### Mexico has stepped up raids on migrant caravans traveling through the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca this year. It has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more who wait endlessly for permits that would allow them to travel legally through Mexico. ### Administration officials told reporters in a briefing call Thursday evening that Mexico could prevent the tariffs from kicking in by securing its southern border with Guatemala, cracking down on criminal smuggling organizations, and entering into a ""safe third country agreement"" that would make it difficult for those who enter Mexico from other countries to claim asylum in the U.S. ### ""We fully believe they have the ability to stop people coming in from their southern border and if they're able to do that, these tariffs will either not go into place or will be removed after they go into place,"" said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. ### Trump said the percentage will gradually increase — up to 25% — until the migration problem is remedied. ### ""Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!"" ### Trump's decision showed the administration going to new lengths, and looking for new levers, to pressure Mexico to take action — even if those risk upending other policy priorities, like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal that is the cornerstone of Trump's legislative agenda and seen as beneficial to his reelection effort. ### Keeping the economy rolling also is critical to Trump's reelection, and business was not happy with the president's planned tariff on Mexican imports. ### ""These proposed tariffs would have devastating consequences on manufacturers in America and on American consumers,"" said Jay Timmons, chief executive officer of the National Association of Manufacturers. ""We have taken our concerns to the highest levels of the administration and strongly urge them to consider carefully the impact of this action on working families across this country."" ### The stock market's tumble on Friday all but guarantees that May will be the first monthly loss for the market in 2019. The news hit automakers particularly hard. Many of them import vehicles into the U.S. from Mexico. ### ""The auto sector - and the 10 million jobs it supports - relies upon the North American supply chain and cross border commerce to remain globally competitive,"" said the Auto Alliance, which represents automakers that built 70% of all cars and light trucks sold in U.S. ""Any barrier to the flow of commerce across the U.S.-Mexico border will have a cascading effect — harming U.S. consumers, threatening American jobs and investment and curtailing economic progress."" ### Some of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress opposed the tariff. Republican senators have made almost weekly treks to the White House to nudge the president off his trade wars, and this latest move sent them scrambling again to signal their displeasure in hopes of reversing Trump's actions. ### Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn supports the president's commitment to securing the border, an aide said, but he opposes the across-the-board tariff, ""which will disproportionately hurt Texas."" ### Key trade senators also spoke up. Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey, who has questioned the administration's ability to invoke national security threats for some other imports, called the tariffs a ""blanket tax increase"" on items Americans purchases from Mexico and ""the wrong remedy."" ### The tariff threat comes at a peculiar time, given how hard the administration has been pushing for passage of the USMCA, which would update the North American Free Trade Agreement. ### Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a usual Trump ally and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, slammed the president's action, saying it was a ""misuse of presidential tariff authority"" that would burden American consumers and ""seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA."" ### Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said the livelihoods of farmers and producers from her state are at risk and so is the USMCA. ### ""If the president goes through with this, I'm afraid progress to get this trade agreement across the finish line will be stifled,"" she said. ### Never miss a story ### Choose the plan that's right for you. ### Digital access or digital and print delivery.",60119,1,""" The auto sector - and the 10 million jobs it supports - relies upon the North American supply chain and cross border commerce to remain globally competitive,"" said the Auto Alliance, which represents automakers that built 70% of all cars and light trucks sold in U.S. ""Any barrier to the flow of commerce across the U.S.-Mexico border will have a cascading effect — harming U.S. consumers, threatening American jobs and investment and curtailing economic progress.

37181,"social-email_circle ### Emerging star Begood Toya Mother signed off from winter racing with a dominating all-the-way five-length win in a style that confirmed to trainer Daniel Bowman that he’s a potential Group 1 spring aspirant. ### Bowman will aim Begood Toya Mother at the Group 1 Sir Rupert Clarke Stakes, which is run over 1400m — the same distance as his Benchmark 84 win yesterday. ### The Warrnambool-based trainer admitted to being nervous before the race. ### “It’s a big relief. I was a bit nervous, when there’s form analysts and whatnot trying to get him beaten. I just backed myself and my team in and we got the job done,” he said. ### Bowman said he hoped Begood Toya Mother would become his stable’s flag-bearer. ### It was Begood Toya Mother’s sixth win from 10 starts and Bowman said it was the first time in his training ­career he had trained a horse to do that. ### Daylight second: Declan Bates and Begood Toya Mother leave their rivals behind. ### All of the four-year-old’s wins have come this campaign. ### Bowman said Begood Toya Mother would be sent to the paddock on Monday and be spelled for three weeks before returning to work for the spring. ### “We’ll try and get his rating up and target the Sir Rupert Clarke Stakes, and if not there’s listed races we can get into.” ### media_camera ### Declan Bates with connections after riding Begood Toya Mother to victory. ### Jockey Declan Bates pushed Begood Toya Mother forward from the outset and he sat outside Elite Drake until turning for home when he surged clear. ### Begood Toya Mother ($1.75 fav) defeated Elite Drake ($6) by five lengths with Arancini ($10) three-quarters of a length away third. ### media_camera ### Dwayne Dunn with trainer David Eustace after making it four winners with Bam's On Fire. ### Dwayne Dunn also took centre stage at Caulfield after riding four winners from five rides in a day which even took him by surprise. ### Dunn rode the first two winners, scoring on The Astrologist and Dogmatic. He then finished seventh on Blinder before winning on his last two rides on Silent Roar and Bam’s On Fire. ### “I liked Bam’s On Fire, I thought she was my best so to have three winners before then was a good feeling going into this race. ### “That’s a good day at the office. I’m off on holiday now and off to Fiji tomorrow and will be there for nine days.” ### It will be a family affair for Dunn while away in Fiji, where his daughter will celebrate her 21st. ### “I haven’t had the best of years but this four should get me up the list a bit,” he said. ### His quartet of wins took him to 40 for the season, placing him third behind Craig Williams and Damien Oliver. ### DAMIAN IN THE FAST LANE ### When Damian Lane took up a contract to ride in Japan, he saw it as a chance to further his education. ### But in only four weeks the 25-year-old has taken Japanese racing by storm. ### After a month of Lane’s two-month contract, he has 19 winners from 71 rides at a 26.8 per cent success rate. ### He’s ridden a Group 1 winner, Normcore, in the Victoria Handicap, two Group 2 victors and a Group 3 winner. ### “I’m surprised. To be honest, I was hoping to get a winner on the board. It’s been beyond my expectations,” Lane said. ### Last Sunday Lane rode short-priced Japanese Derby favourite Saturnalia, who finished fourth after missing the start, in front of a crowd of more than 110,000 in Tokyo. ### Tomorrow he will ride in another of Japan’s most famous races, the Yasuda Kinen. ### Lane will be on Stelvio, the fourth favourite, in a race featuring the clash of superstars Almond Eye and Danon ­Premium. ### “My horse will run well and if the other two don’t turn up, he’ll go close,” Lane said. ### He said he knew the Japanese loved their horse racing but was unprepared for their passion, particularly on race day. ### “It’s a different atmosphere. They are all there for the ­racing and nothing else and you can feel it,” Lane said. ### “I’ve never experienced an atmosphere like last Sunday. At Flemington, if there’s a crowd like that, it’s at best 50 per cent racegoers and the other 50 per cent partygoers. ### “It doesn’t feel the same.” ### Lane said other evidence of Japan’s insatiable appetite for horse racing was the media coverage. ### “At trackwork on Wednesday and Thursday, there’s 15 to 20 different media people there. Also, each Monday, two racing magazines come out and it gets lots of mentions in the general newspapers as well as the sports pages,” he said. ### Lane said he was extremely fortunate how things had worked out for him in Japan. ### “My translator Adam ­Harrigan has been a great help and also my sponsor is one of their top trainers in Noriyuki Hori. Also Christoph Lemaire was suspended and he was going to ride Normcore in the Group 1 that I won,” he said. ### Lane said on his second day in Japan he rode four winners and things had then snowballed. ### He said he was making good connections with Japanese trainers and hoped that would open doors in the future. ### The Victorian-based hoop said he would love to come back and ride there again. ### media_camera ### Craig Williams combines with Bandipur to take out the MRC Membership Renewal Handicap. ### IN A NUTSHELL ### BANDIPUR BRILLIANCE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH ### In-form sprinter Bandipur made it three city wins from his past five starts when successful at Caulfield in the MRC Membership Renewal (1100m) — but he’s listed for sale this week. ### “Hopefully that could get him a reprieve but if it doesn’t, someone’s going to get a good horse for themselves,” said James Cummings’ Melbourne foreman Kate Grimwade. ### Bandipur will be sold at Friday’s Magic Millions Horses In Training sale on the Gold Coast. ### “I’m sure James will make a case to Godolphin to keep him. They want to have Group 1 horses and he’s a victim of that,” Grimwade said. ### “He’s a lovely horse and since he’s been gelded he’s been racing so well. He’s still only four and he’s got a lot of racing ahead of him.” ### ANOTHER ONE HITS THE ROAD FOR SADLER ### John Sadler was pleased that Asgard Massif, who led throughout to salute over 1440m, could win for his Singapore-based client Dr Casey Tan but he’s resigned to the fact that’s where he’s going to do his future racing. ### “He might have one more start here but he’ll either go to Singapore or be sold to Hong Kong,” Sadler said. ### Sadler’s recent Flemington winner Big Night Out is also heading to Hong Kong. Sadler said he was happy to reward apprentice Teo Nugent, who rides trackwork for him, with a win, in his first ride for him. ### media_camera ### Job done: Dwayne Dunn and Dogmatic. Pictures: Getty Images ### DID YOU SEE/HEAR? ### Dogmatic, the winner of the second race over 2000m, has exceeded expectations in his two starts for two wins since he joined Richard Laming’s stable. ### Laming said he was purchased as a likely Northern Territory Derby horse but in two starts for the stable he’s proved he’s better than that. ### “He loves wet tracks so why go there and race for similar prizemoney?” he said. ### Jockey Dwayne Dunn said he advised the owners to purchase the gelding from Godolphin, having ridden him in trackwork and races. ### Dunn told them they were getting a horse of midweek standard but Dogmatic’s love of the wet had elevated him to a Saturday winner. ### Not surprising CATH'S VILLAGE shows plenty of ticker there to be narrowly beaten by favourite PETRELLE.

It was nearly five times more popular than any other runner. ### BETS: The Astrologist $500 x $1000 e/w @ $10/$2.80, $500 @ $10 ### BETS: Wilmot Pass $3600 @ $2.60, $4500 @ $2.50 ### RACE TWO ### N/A ### RACE THREE ### Asgard Masif landed a number of big bets after leading all-the-way in the Grunt Standing @ Yulong Handicap (1440m). ### The John Sadler-trained runner was $2.90-$3.10 on the day, however, TAB had opened up at $5 on Wednesday and punters didn’t need to be asked a second time to take the price. ### Asgard Masif, under the urgings of Theodore Nugent, was challenged by Persuader ($19-$26) but kicked strongly to hold it at bay, with Despacito ($21) winding up in third. Ligulate ($3.80-$4.20), best tried outside the favourite but still holding a third of the money that Asgard Masif did, was close up in fourth. ### BETS: Asgard Masif $9,000 @ $3, $1,800 @ $2.90, $1,700 @ $2.90, ### BETS: Mr Genoa $2,000 @ $12, $1,000 @ $12 ### RACE FOUR ### The late money was for Silent Roar and Dwayne Dunn did the right thing by its backers in the Long Fine Plate (1600m). ### The Team Hawkes-trained runner was hammered late in betting and firmed $4.40-$3.90 in the closing minutes. Dunn took the mare straight to the top and the pair were never headed, booting clear on straightening to score impressively. ### Royal Thunder ($21) and Snipfit ($71) added spice to the exotics. ### Silent Roar accounted for over 33 percent of the total investment. ### BETS: Silent Roar $2000 @ $4.20, $1500 @ $4.20, $4500 @ $4, $3000 @ $4, $1000 @ $4 TWICE, $1000 @ $3.90 ### RACE FIVE ### Craig Williams hugged the rails all-the-way in the MRC Membership Renewal Handicap (1100m) and it paid dividends with Bandipur. ### The Godolphin runner was powerful over the concluding stages when going along the inside of the leader, Jungle Edge ($5.50-$4.20), and then held off Malibu Style ($6.50) and Holy Blade ($12) with the frontrunner holding fourth. ### Bandipur drifted in betting on the day and went $3-$3.90 but went around as favourite.

It was Dwayne Dunn’s fourth winner of the day. ### Propelle, which was one of the most popular runners across the country, went around as the $2.70 favourite and held more than four times the amount of money than the winner. ### BETS: Bam’s On Fire $3000 @ $5 ### BETS: Propelle $2,000 @ $2.70, $4000 @ $2.60, $2800 @ $2.60, $2500 @ $2.60, $4000 @ $2.50 ### BETS: Feared Eyes $4000 @ $9 ### RACE SEVEN ### Begood Toya Mother did the job again for those wanting to take the shorts when it led throughout in the seventh event on the card. ### The Daniel Bowman runner jumped $1.70 clear top pick and dominated the market despite the hot price, with 56 percent of the total investment riding on the gelding. The four-year-old was heavily leveraged through multis too. ### Declan Bates didn’t have to do a great deal on the son of Myboycharlie as the pair cruised to an effortless win over Elite Drake ($9.50-$6) and Arancini ($9.50). ### BETS: Begood Toya Mother $6000 @ $1.70, $4000 @ $1.70, $2292 @ $1.70, $1500 @ $1.70 ### RACE EIGHT ### Petrelle was heavily backed late and was another well-tried runner to get the cash in the eighth event on the program from Caulfield. ### The Archie Alexander runner sat wide on the speed throughout but still proved too strong for Cath’s Village ($14), which took the shortcuts home, and Grey Shadow ($8). ### Petrelle had been $4.20 in the morning but such was the support for the daughter of Fastnet Rock that she was crunched into $2.70 favouritism. She displaced Miss Vixen at the top of the market after that runner went $4-$4.60-$4.40 in the final stages of betting, winding up fourth. ### BETS: Petrelle $4585 @ $2.80, $2000 @ $2.70 ### RACE NINE ### Pacodali upset the move for Live And Free in the Catanach’s Jewellers Handicap (2000m). ### Opening the day at $5.50, Pacodali bottomed out at $4.40 before jumping a $5 shot and although attracting some good money, wasn’t holding anywhere near as much as the fav or Morton’s Fork ($5.50). ### Aided by a well-timed ride by Theodore Nugent, the gelding swept to the front early in the straight and then held off the big finish of Live And Free ($2.70). Beau Balmain ($13), which had specking at the eachway quote, wound up in third. ### Live And Free held approximately 45 percent of the total investment. ### BETS: Pacodali $1000 @ $4.60, $1000 @ $4.40 ### BETS: Live And Free $10,000 @ $2.90 ### BETS: Second Bullet $4000 @ $11",60119,1,"“ My horse will run well and if the other two don’t turn up, he’ll go close,” Lane said.###He said he knew the Japanese loved their horse racing but was unprepared for their passion, particularly on race day.###“ It’s a different atmosphere.

There is a perspective that it is a Russian Iskander missile, or it is a new tactical ballistic missile,"" he said. ### ""There are data that we can verify, and we are working off those data to make sure we have a verification."" ### Jeong was responding to a question on whether the tests were a violation of a military agreement between South and North Korea last September to halt acts of aggression against each other. ### He said the North was ""in fact acting within the boundaries"" of the agreement and tensions between their militaries ""have been lowered to a significant extent."" ### ""So currently the actions done by the North Korean regime have the intent to carry out the peace process through dialogue and talks. And I believe that's the hidden intent behind the lines in terms of their missile launches."" ### Jeong called on the international community to ""assure North Korea that the decision to denuclearize is indeed the right decision."" ### He said that South Korea sees humanitarian aid and the lowering of military tensions as ways ""to lead North Korea into conversation and away from ... the ways of the past."" ### North Korea itself has defended the launches, saying it was exercising its right to self-defense. ### The U.S. and Japan say the short-range ballistic missile tests on May 4 and 9 were a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The tests ended a pause in launches that began in late 2017, and came amid deadlocked negotiations to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons. ### Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya, who spoke at the same session on Korean security, stressed that a strict implementation of sanctions against North Korea was necessary. ### He specifically directed his comments at South Korea, China and Russia. ### ""We need to enhance surveillance on a global scale while strengthening effort locally to ensure the full implementation of sanctions,"" Iwaya said. ### Earlier Saturday, U.S. Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan told the Shangri-La Dialogue conference that North Korea ""remains an extraordinary threat"" and has ""neared a point where it could credibly strike regional allies, U.S. territory, and our forward-deployed forces."" ### © Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., waves before speaking during the 2019 California Democratic Party State Organizing Convention in San Francisco, Saturday, June 1, 2019. ### Photo: Jeff Chiu, AP ### Warren tells Dem activists 'time for small ideas is over' ### 1  /  32 ### Back to Gallery ### SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Sen. Elizabeth Warren electrified California Democrats on Saturday with a pledge for bold action, matching if not outshining enthusiasm for the state's own Sen. Kamala Harris to kick off a day when more than a dozen presidential candidates planned to make their cases to thousands of activists in the nation's largest liberal stronghold. ### ""Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses,"" Warren said in bringing the crowd to its feet with a thinly veiled shot at former Vice President Joe Biden, who has expressed hope the GOP will have ""an epiphany"" after President Donald Trump is gone. ""But our country is in a crisis. The time for small ideas is over."" ### Biden was the only major candidate not attending the three-day gathering in San Francisco, opting instead to campaign in Ohio. ### California has shifted its 2020 primary earlier on the calendar, to March 3, part of the Super Tuesday collection of contests, in hopes of giving the state more sway in choosing the party's nominee. California will offer the largest delegate haul, but it is a notoriously difficult state to campaign in, given its massive size and expensive media markets. ### While Harris has a built-in advantage, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is also expecting to build heavily on the organization he built in the 2016 contest. She looked to make a show of force in Saturday's prime speaking slot to kick off addresses from presidential hopefuls, the day's main event.

94495,"The RetroBeat: Aladdin is a Genesis masterpiece ### May 31, 2019 2:20 PM ### Above: Aladdin for the Sega Genesis ### Image Credit: Retrovolve ### Diablo co-creator’s action-RPG It Lurks Below leaves Steam Early Access ### I saw Disney’s live action remake of Aladdin last week. Along with video games, I’m a big Disney fan. I’m usually at the theater for every movie event from the Mouse House. ### Aladdin was OK. Maybe a little worse than OK. It was something interesting to watch once, but I’d never prefer it over the animated classic. Or, for that matter, the fantastic Sega Genesis game. ### Licensed games used to have a reputation among the hardcore for sucking. Now … well, licensed games aren’t much of a thing at all. You find them mostly on mobile as free-to-play experiences. But back in ’90s, every major Hollywood movie would have a console game lined up to release around the same time as the film. It served the same purpose as action figures or other toys. “You saw the movie, now play the game!” ### Aladdin for the Genesis was different in a couple ways. First off, it came out a whole year after the movie. Aladdin released in theaters on November 25, 1992. The Genesis game didn’t come out until November 11, 1993. Its launch coincided closer to the VHS release of the movie in October 1993. ### Compared to a lot of the awful movie tie-in games from the era, Aladdin was fantastic. Heck, it stands up well with the very best of the Genesis library. The action is relatively simple. Aladdin is an action sidescroller where you have to run, jump, and slash your way through levels. The execution is just fantastic. Every action in Aladdin feels precise, and the game offers a good challenge without ever feeling cruel. ### But Aladdin stood out because of its visuals. Real Disney animators created actual art for the game’s sprites, which developer Virgin Interactive then digitized. The result is some of the best 2D graphics of the 16-bit era. The characters themselves are more animated and expressive than what was usual for the time. ### The excellence of the art becomes clear when you compare the Genesis Aladdin game with the one for Super Nintendo. This version of Aladdin is a completely different game. This practice wasn’t too unusual for the time, especially for movie tie-ins like Jurassic Park and Batman Returns. ### Now, Aladdin on Super Nintendo is still a fine game. Capcom, which had created Disney gaming classic like DuckTales for the NES, made this version. But the sprites in this Aladdin look more like a video game interpretation, while the characters on Genesis look like they jumped out of a movie screen. ### Back in April, I wrote about some of the games I want to see on the upcoming Sega Genesis Mini . I included Aladdin on that list, but I thought I was being optimistic. Licensed games don’t usually make it onto these microconsoles. But Sega has surprised by since announcing that other Disney Genesis games, specifically Castle of Illusion and World of Illusion, will be added to the machine. I also thought that Mega Man: The Wily Wars was a long shot, and it actually made it into the library! ### So maybe there is still hope for Aladdin on the Sega Genesis Mini after all. And since it is one of the best games made for the console, it deserves to be there.  If you have any retro-themed projects or scoops you’d like to send my way, please  contact me .",60119,1,"Compared to a lot of the awful movie tie-in games from the era, Aladdin was fantastic.

65873,"Daytona riverfront property remains in limbo ###  ### Saturday ### Jun 1, 2019 at 4:58 PM Jun 1, 2019 at 4:58 PM ### Local residents say they want publicly owned land east of Beach Street to remain public, and they'll fight passionately to hold on to that access. ### DAYTONA BEACH — Some local residents were shocked a few months ago when they found out the city had been trying for two years to eradicate decades-old restrictions that ban any sort of private use on publicly owned land along the Halifax River. ### Those who want to see the downtown riverfront property remain open to the public got a reprieve this spring when a bill aimed at clearing the way for the restrictions to be removed never got a committee hearing in Tallahassee. ### But the effort could be rebooted in about six months, something at least a few city officials hope to see. ### ""My objective is just going back to the drawing board and trying again next year,"" said Mayor Derrick Henry. ### Whether the full weight of City Hall would be behind another bill is undetermined. City spokeswoman Susan Cerbone said City Manager Jim Chisholm and Hardy Smith, the city's government relations administrator, are still mulling over their next move. ### ""From my last conversation with Mr. Chisholm and Hardy a few days ago, no decisions have been made to how to move forward,"" Cerbone said last week. ### One local resident who's adamantly opposed to any sort of private development on the downtown waterfront land isn't waiting to see what happens next. James Hunt said he's going to start speaking out at Volusia County Council and Daytona Beach City Commission meetings this month, sending emails to hundreds of people ranging from government officials to church leaders, and ""talking it up with anyone who will listen."" ### Hunt said he will also be launching the website SaveCityIsland.com and sending out press releases. ### ""I can't wait. I've got to go like gangbusters,"" said Hunt, a 76-year-old Port Orange resident who has happy childhood memories of playing on City Island back in the 1950s. ""I'm ready to go."" ### [ALSO READ: Daytona riverfront land effort quiet, but not secret] ### 'Public purposes forever' ### The story behind the land restrictions begins in the early 1900s, when the state started dredging the Halifax River to keep the channel navigable for boats. The sandy muck that was dug out was piled up and started to form small islands in the river. ### With no real use for the piles of spoil, the state began transferring them to the city in 1925. More dredging expeditions and transfers were completed in 1953, 1954 and 1963. ### The spoil land evolved into nearly 100 acres that is now Riverfront Park, Manatee Island, Halifax Harbor Marina and City Island. It's land that's home to a library, Jackie Robinson Ballpark, tennis courts, a farmer's market, courthouse annex and the Daytona Regional Chamber of Commerce headquarters. ### The hitch was the new land came with deed restrictions. The stipulations said the spoil land had to be used solely for ""public purposes forever,"" and the property would revert back to the state if the city ever sold or leased it to any private person or business for any private use. ### Deed restrictions on some parcels also imposed revenue sharing requirements for any activity on the property. The limitations have tied the city's hands so tightly that even putting up a swing set or adding lighting has required permission on some of the state-transferred parcels, Smith said. The state has also maintained oil, gas and mineral rights. ### Despite those strict limitations, at least seven times since 1966 there have been attempts to get stores, hotels and sleek condominium towers on City Island. Every time, the proposals have been swiftly beaten back by furious opposition and the restrictions that have loomed over the public space since its existence. ### In March 2017, the city began a lengthy process to ask the state to lift the restrictions. After close to two years of evaluating the land, verifying records and clearing titles to the property, the state had its answer. ### In early December last year, then-Gov. Rick Scott and the Cabinet voted to lift all of the deed restrictions on 97 acres east of Beach Street between Orange Avenue and Main Street. The matter wound up before the governor and Cabinet because they meet as a group called the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection's Division of State Lands works with that board and provides oversight for the management of more than 12 million acres of public lands including lakes, rivers and islands. ### The OK from the governor and Cabinet, however, came with a big-dollar caveat. The state ordered Daytona Beach to pay $8.77 million to buy its way out of the restrictions. ### A local legislator filed a bill this spring asking the state to put an end to the deed restrictions without charging anything. The measure was assigned to three committees, but nothing happened. The session ended without any action on the bill sponsored by freshman state Rep. Elizabeth Fetterhoff, R-DeLand. ### ""Basically local bills take a long time to get through the process anyway, and there was no appetite to move forward on it at the state level,"" Fetterhoff said. ### She said it's up to committee chairpersons to decide whether a bill is heard, and the first committee chairman — who headed up the Local, Federal and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee — chose not to have it discussed. ### Fetterhoff said she has heard local leaders ""were looking at other avenues to come up with the money"" now. ### 'Can't drop our guard' ### City leaders want their hands untied to pursue future development of the waterfront properties. But they're not eager to pay $8.77 million. ### Henry said he wants the city to control the land, but he won't support digging into local revenues to make that happen. ### ""I have no interest in including that in our budget next year,"" Henry said. ""It's not something we'll be pursuing at all."" ### City Commissioner Ruth Trager agrees $8.77 million is too much for the city to shoulder. ### ""If we have to pay for it, it's not worth it,"" Trager said. ""That's too much for the residents to pay that."" ### She wants the deed restrictions lifted, but not to lure private development. ### ""Personally I think we need to keep the island for the people,"" Trager said. ""It belongs to the people, not developers."" ### Daytona beachside resident Mary Welch shares that opinion wholeheartedly. Welch has been contemplating having yard signs and bumper stickers made that say ""City Island Not For Sale."" ### ""It just doesn't seem right to be selling it without a public vote,"" she said. ### Smith has said the city would probably lease the land — not sell it — but Welch wouldn't much care for that either. ### ""We can't drop our guard; that's for sure,"" said Welch, who started visiting Daytona Beach in the 1950s and made it her home in 2006. ""That's good news that it didn't get out of committee. That's excellent. But we can't let them try it again."" ### Welch said she left a comment on Fetterhoff's Facebook page to ask ""why she's sticking her nose"" in Daytona Beach business. ### ""I asked her, what's in it for you?"" Welch said. ""She never replied."" ### Fetterhoff said she understands there's been pushback from local residents who want all of the land to remain open for public use, but she said ""it needs some value. It's off the tax rolls."" ### ""I get the issue from all sides,"" Fetterhoff said. ### Hunt will lobby hard to keep the property open, public space. ### ""I'm going to take a very aggressive position,"" he said. ""As far as I'm concerned, they're stealing the land."" ### He said he'll fight for what he believes is iconic property. But he's afraid it's only a matter of time until private investors get a piece of the Halifax riverbank between Orange Avenue and Main Street. ### ""My opinion is that they're going to wait until some developer comes in with a large project so $8.77 million becomes not that big of a deal,"" Hunt predicted. ### If the restrictions are removed at some point and developers step forward, the city and county will have to work together. The county owns the City Island library and courthouse, and the footprint of the land underneath each, said County Attorney Dan Eckert. The county also owns the courthouse parking lot, Eckert said. ### He said the county-owned library and courthouse land do not have state deed restrictions on them. There's already been talk of tearing down the courthouse and replacing it with a new building on the west side of Beach Street, but the county hasn't made any decisions yet, Eckert said. ### Riverfront Park is off the table for private development since city commissioners recently approved a 50-year contract with a nonprofit foundation that will ensure it remains a park open to the public at least until 2068. ### Chisholm has said he's trying to position Daytona Beach for greater things. ### ""Growth and change can seem scary to some people; however, the reality is that if status quo is maintained, a city will become stagnant and falter,"" Chisholm wrote in an opinion piece he submitted to The News-Journal a few months ago. ""It is our job as city leaders to explore all smart growth options while maintaining our competitiveness."" ### Having full control of the one-mile stretch of public property along the river will help a mix of new development thrive, he said. ### ""Removing the restrictions and allowing us to move forward on this growth is the right thing to do for our city and for future generations who will call Daytona Beach home,"" Chisholm said. ### Never miss a story ### Choose the plan that's right for you. ### Digital access or digital and print delivery.",60119,1,"One local resident who's adamantly opposed to any sort of private development on the downtown waterfront land isn't waiting to see what happens next.

Sign Up Today ### Martin Daly ### Save ### THERE are many issues other than the NAR’s bungling of the aftermath of the 1990 attempted coup with which I would like to engage. ### However, my colleague, Anthony Smart, has presented some material which he says shows that the NAR did not seek to avoid the amnesty or postpone having its validity determined promptly. He refers first to a speech he made in Parliament on August 11, 1990 referring to the amnesty and his government’s position on it. ### The problem with that speech is that by the time Anthony made it, the NAR’s attempt to suppress the amnesty had already been made and failed. At a media conference attended by national and international media on August 1, 1990 the NAR government, through then minister Winston Dookeran, stated that the insurrectionists had surrendered unconditionally. ### However, talk was already around undermining the unconditional surrender narrative and copies of the amnesty began appearing. Town was on to it. Anthony’s speech was in reactive language and made “to allay the fears of the population on the issue”, namely “concern expressed by the population about certain documents”. The documents were identified and among them was the “alleged amnesty for the hostage takers”. ### One additional stunning fact (among others) evidencing an initial intention to suppress the amnesty is this: it appears from the Simmons Commission of Enquiry that the Government did not tell Colonel Joseph Theodore (as he then was), its lead negotiator for the release of the hostages, that the amnesty had been issued. ### Similarly, we do not know what Dookeran was told before he faced the media on August 1st. He never met with the lawyers, who were voluntarily assisting, despite the urgings of the government’s chief of communications, Dr Gregory Shaw, that Dookeran should be briefed by the lawyers before going to the media conference. Let’s get to two other shockers. I made it plain that an important legal point about the amnesty was not taken, contrary to the advice given by the initial legal team of whom I was one. I told the commission that politics was the reason it was not pursued. ### Anthony, for some reason, interpreted what I was saying about politics as relating to the composition of the legal team, when I was specifically referring to the omission to raise an important constitutional point contrary to our advice. In Chapter 9 of its report the Simmons Commission found as follows: “We think that there was merit in the contention of Messrs. de la Bastide and Daly that the President could not validly act on his own but was required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet. Since the Cabinet could not give and was in no position to give advice ‘that was the end of the matter’, as Mr de la Bastide put it.” ### “The Commission is satisfied that although the legal arguments referred to (paragraphs 9.238 of the report) were advanced to the legal team representing the State in the Privy Council, they were not pleaded and argued. In such a case, the Privy Council could not have pronounced upon an issue not pleaded and argued.”  ### SUBSCRIBE/ LOG IN ### Further, whatever the NAR government might boast that it did to refurbish a building for the trial of the 114 insurrectionists, the refurbishment became futile when the Privy Council dismissed in scathing terms the plan to try the insurrectionists in batches over a prolonged period while keeping them incarcerated until they could raise the amnesty at a trial far away in the future. This plan differed from initial advice to let the amnesty be tested in court immediately. ### In December 1991, in delivering the first of the Privy Council decisions, Lord Ackner dismissed the trial in batches plan: “No civilised system of law should tolerate the years of delay contemplated by the Courts below before the lawfulness of the imprisonment could effectively be challenged.” ### The record is already straight. See the two Privy Council decisions and the findings of the Simmons Commission of Enquiry. If the back story is ever told, that will reveal the unsound basis on which the NAR decision makers departed from advice initially given.",60119,1,"Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!###Your notification has been saved.###There was a problem saving your notification.###{{description}}###Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.###Save","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]","<p>Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!</p><p>Your notification has been saved.</p><p>There was a problem saving your notification.</p><p>{{description}}</p><p>Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.</p><p>Save</p>",1093

She spearheaded various rescue operations during her term, including those in Libya and Yemen. The former EAM was much-loved by people for being one of the most approachable ministers, known for hearing out and solving grievances on Twitter. ### Jaishankar pledged to follow the precedent set by her, and tweeted, “We at Team @MEAIndia continue to be at your service 24×7. Happy to be leading the effort with my colleague MoS Muraleedharan ji.” ### The EAM went on to express his gratitude for the wishes extended by his counterparts from Australia, France and Indonesia, who tweeted their greetings for the former top diplomat. ### Both Jaishankar and the new Minister of State for External Affairs, V Muraleedharan, assumed office on May 31, following the official announcement regarding portfolio allocations. ### “Back at South Block, in a new role! The new External Affairs Minister of India @DrSJaishankar assumes office,” MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar tweeted on Friday. ### A former career diplomat, the 1977-batch IFS officer and Padma Shri awardee served as the Foreign Secretary for three years – from 2015 until his retirement in 2018 – under Modi’s previous term as Prime Minister. ### He had earlier served as India’s Ambassador to China and then to the US. The incumbent EAM has previously been India’s Ambassador to the Czech Republic and High Commissioner to Singapore as well. He was also the First Secretary and Political Advisor to the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka. ### It is believed that Modi first met Jaishankar when he travelled to China as the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2012. ### The former diplomat played a critical role in handling tough negotiations with Beijing, following the incursion in Doklam and Ladakh’s Depsang. ### He is also known as the Indian government’s key strategist for China and the US. In 2008, Jaishankar was a member of the team which negotiated the landmark Indo-US nuclear deal under the UPA government headed by then-Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. ### Source: ANI",60119,1,"“Back at South Block, in a new role!

Stander was also on target with two conversions and a penalty. ### The Lions picked up a full-house of five points for their victory to leap-frog into second place in the South African Conference and fifth in the Overall log . ### The Stormers left empty-handed and stayed bottom of the South African Conference and 11th in the Overall standings . ### In next weekend's Round 17 action, the Lions welcome the high-flying Hurricanes to Ellis Park (Saturday, June 8 - 15:05), while the Stormers host the Sunwolves in a must-win clash at Newlands (Saturday, June 8 - 17:15). ### Teams: ### Lions ### 15 Andries Coetzee, 14 Courtnall Skosan,  13 Lionel Mapoe, 12 Harold Vorster, 11 Aphiwe Dyantyi, 10 Shaun  Reynolds, 9 Ross Cronjé, 8 Kwagga Smith (captain), 7 Vincent Tshituka, 6  Cyle Brink, 5 Marvin Orie, 4 Stephan Lewies, 3 Carlü Sadie, 2 Malcolm  Marx, 1 Dylan Smith ### Substitutes: 16 Jan-Henning Campher, 17 Sti  Sithole, 18 Johannes Jonker, 19 Reinhard Nothnagel, 20 Marnus Schoeman,  21 Hacjivah Dayimani, 22 Nic Groom, 23 Tyrone Green ### Stormers ### 15  Damian Willemse, 14 Seabelo Senatla, 13 JJ Engelbrecht, 12 Damian de  Allende, 11 Dillyn Leyds, 10 Josh Stander, 9 Herschel Jantjies, 8  Sikhumbuzo Notshe, 7 Johan du Toit, 6 Jaco Coetzee, 5 Cobus Wiese, 4  Eben Etzebeth, 3 Wilco Louw, 2 Chad Solomon, 1 Steven Kitshoff (captain) ### Substitutes:  16 Daniel Jooste, 17 Corne Fourie, 18 Frans Malherbe, 19 Ernst van  Rhyn, 20 Marno Redelinghuys, 21 Justin Phillips, 22 Jean-Luc du Plessis,  23 Dan Kriel ### Share This",60119,1,"15 Damian Willemse, 14 Seabelo Senatla, 13 JJ Engelbrecht, 12 Damian de  Allende, 11 Dillyn Leyds, 10 Josh Stander, 9 Herschel Jantjies, 8 Sikhumbuzo Notshe, 7 Johan du Toit, 6 Jaco Coetzee, 5 Cobus Wiese, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Wilco Louw, 2 Chad Solomon, 1 Steven Kitshoff (captain)###Substitutes:  16 Daniel Jooste, 17 Corne Fourie, 18 Frans Malherbe, 19 Ernst van Rhyn, 20 Marno Redelinghuys, 21 Justin Phillips, 22 Jean-Luc du Plessis, 23 Dan Kriel","[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]","<p>15 Damian Willemse, 14 Seabelo Senatla, 13 JJ Engelbrecht, 12 Damian de  Allende, 11 Dillyn Leyds, 10 Josh Stander, 9 Herschel Jantjies, 8 Sikhumbuzo Notshe, 7 Johan du Toit, 6 Jaco Coetzee, 5 Cobus Wiese, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Wilco Louw, 2 Chad Solomon, 1 Steven Kitshoff (captain)</p><p>Substitutes:  16 Daniel Jooste, 17 Corne Fourie, 18 Frans Malherbe, 19 Ernst van Rhyn, 20 Marno Redelinghuys, 21 Justin Phillips, 22 Jean-Luc du Plessis, 23 Dan Kriel</p>",1096
73758,"Last 24 Hours: ### Total: ### As Two LAPD Officers Are Treated for Typhus, Here’s How LA City Gov’t Helped Create the Problem ### Friday, May 31, 2019 14:22 ### % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents. ### Two Los Angeles Police Department employees are being treated for “salmonella typhi” and “salmonella typhi-like symptoms,” according to a press release issued May 30. ### Rather than admitting the obvious – that the city has been dealing with an infectious disease crisis, caused by medieval sanitation conditions throughout the city, since the first confirmed typhus case in October 2018 – the release simply states: ### “Our Facilities Management Division is working with the city’s General Services Department to disinfect any work areas that may have been exposed and that work is expected to be completed [Thursday] evening. Our police officers often patrol in adverse environments and can be exposed to various dangerous elements. We have…provided them with strategies to stay healthy while we mitigate this issue.” ### These “adverse environments” include City Hall, which is overrun with rats . ### The sanitation situation is so bad that Dr. Drew Pinsky recently predicted that “there will be a major infectious disease epidemic this summer in Los Angeles.” He blamed the politicians: ### “We have tens and tens of thousands of people living in tents. Horrible conditions. Sanitation. Rats have taken over the city….We have multiple rodent-borne, flea-borne illnesses, plague, typhus. We’re gonna have louse-borne illness. If measles breaks into that population, we have tuberculosis exploding. Literally, our politicians are like Nero. It’s worse than Nero. ### “It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen in my life….I feel like I’m on a train track waving at the train and the train is going to go off the bridge. The bridge is out.” ### The politicians Pinsky blames for the crisis accuse him of hyperbole, blaming the massive homeless population for the “adverse conditions” and claim that they just need more money (more money!) to help the homeless. But, it turns out that the city political machine’s insatiable appetite for grift and control has played a big part in creating and perpetuating this problem. ### See, in 2017 LA Mayor (and potential someday POTUS candidate) Eric Garcetti’s pet recycling program, RecycLA, rolled out . Under the new program the city was divided into seven sections and in each section one recycling company was given the exclusive right to operate in that area – and the City of Los Angeles raked in $35 million for those exclusive rights. ### Guess what happened? Fees doubled and tripled, and missed pickups skyrocketed – over 28,000 missed pickups in the first six months of the program. ### Merchants whose recycling bills went from $1,200 to $2,200 or more – per month – started finding innovative ways to take care of their trash. LA Times reporter Steve Lopez describes the situation (emphasis added): ### On Agatha Street near Crocker Street, I watched a homeless dumpster diver half-disappear into a bin, digging for recyclables. As I was watching, and standing with Ramirez and one of his uniformed deputies, a man exited an alley on foot carrying several boxes and other debris and threw the junk down on the sidewalk, right in front of us. ### “You can’t do that,” Ramirez protested, ordering the man to pick up the trash and properly dispose of it in a bin. ### We followed him back into the alley, where he tossed the junk into a dumpster and then showed Ramirez the tarp he sleeps under. He said the business owners allow him to sleep there in return for dumping all the trash, and they apparently don’t care where he disposes of it. ### Word on the street, from merchants and homeless people, was that some of the more unscrupulous merchants routinely dump their own trash on the streets or pay homeless people a few bucks to get rid of it for them. ### So, the streets look like this – and from Downtown LA to Santa Monica, Angelenos fear for their health this summer. ### — Ian (@FreeSpeechian) May 7, 2019 ### If that happens, Dr. Drew proposes one solution: ### “Here’s what I want to do, I want to take away qualified immunity from the politicians so we can go after them for reckless negligence.” ### That’s one way to look at it. A few residents might also hope people like Garcetti and his family are the ones whose health suffers.",60119,1,"As Two LAPD Officers Are Treated for Typhus, Here’s How LA City Gov’t Helped Create the Problem###Friday, May 31, 2019 14:22###% of readers think this story is Fact.
