Due to the continued renovation of the downtown, you might have forgotten us. It was hard to get to our front door, even harder to keep the walks open and clear. But we are still here, still worshiping in the parish hall, and still without a new roof. ### Why no roof yet, you ask? Well, we are dead set against beginning to spend money we don’t have. We have been busy raising money; possibly too quiet about it. We have raised to date more than $600,000 and we have managed to qualify for two grants. We are proud of our successes. But, dear friends, we still need more money to get the job done, to fix our roof, and move our congregation back into the sanctuary. We want to have you visit the sanctuary too. ### We have the most glorious stained glass windows…do come on a sunny day. We will be happy to give you a tour or just let you wander about and enjoy them without our talking in your ear. We have literature you can take away with you to read later. You can come again and see them after you have read it. Come and enjoy our wonderful Episcopal liturgy with us on Sundays and other days of worship. We will be happy to have you and give you good coffee and something to eat afterward. ### But if you cannot visit, and do not want to join us for worship, will you please consider helping us continue to be present at First and East Main Street to protect our downtown treasures including the only Tiffany window in Central Ohio. If you cannot contribute to our fund raising, could you consider putting a collection can in your business for folks to leave change in? ### We have raised quite a lot that way from the few cans we have out. And, if that is not possible, would you consider talking about the need to help us preserve the history of the downtown by saving the windows given as memorials for those who helped make Newark, Newark. They include veterans from every war since the Civil War: local bankers, merchants, lawyers, and let’s not forget the women who have cooked, cleaned, baked, sewn, and generally made us who we are. All of these folks mean a lot to us, and a lot to you as the past residents of our community, Newark. ### NEWSLETTERS",60119,1,"We have the most glorious stained glass windows… do come on a sunny day.

(Mexican Summer via AP) ### HONS ### Review: Cate Le Bon gets reflective on new album 'Reward' ### JAKE O'CONNELL Associated Press ### Save ### Cate Le Bon, ""Reward"" (Mexican Summer) ### On her fifth solo album, Welsh eccentric performer Cate Le Bon continues to expand her own enchanted musical realm. ""Reward"" is a touch more direct than past releases but shares the same subversive grace. ### The record's first line — ""decorate the new discord"" — acts not only as a motif but speaks to the subtle depth that lies within. From there, a subdued saxophone flirts with a flared synth and Le Bon's pillow-y harmonies. Her voice is both expressive and airy and her accent accentuated when she sings. ### On ""The Light,"" Le Bon discloses ""I don't need the poetry"" but her introspection doesn't agree. Even when just ""mouthing the words"" about ""half-used"" intentions, a state of ""occasional bloom"" is depicted. ### At times she seems impenetrable, at others an aching vulnerability is revealed — at one point determining: ""I'm a cross hair."" The intricate hooks also reveal themselves gradually, popping out of nowhere or unfurling deceptively. ### A distinct sense of place and universality are both at play. That dichotomy is part of the draw. ""Home to You"" details the complicated nature of residence, redefining the concept as ""an impasse under hallway ceilings"" or a ""drink from borrowed cups."" ### The instrumental palette is just as whimsical. Elliptical keyboards flutter on buoyant basslines. A dewy slide adorns ""Sad Nudes."" ''Mother's Mother's Magazines"" reads like a Kinks' title and starts out like a song from The Fall before easing back for a brass excursion. ""Magnificent Gestures"" raises the pulse. With an assist from Kurt Vile, Le Bon ruminates on a ""teacher's laugh"" before torpedoing guitar shards take it all down. ### ""Daylight Matters"" is the one to put on repeat. A sultry, almost disco sway meant for late afternoon drifting. Most of this is so pretty it could float around in the background without another thought. But the acute listener is rewarded. ### Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

McCain made for Trump visit ### Posted: 7:43 AM, Jun 01, 2019 ### Updated: 2019-06-01 13:43:05Z ### By: CNN Newsource ### The US Navy acknowledged Friday that a request had been made regarding the USS John S. McCain in relation to President Donald Trump's visit to Japan, but said the ship ended up remaining in its normal configuration. ### The statement continues a saga stemming from emails exchanged between the White House and lower-level US Navy officials about keeping a warship named for the late Sen. John McCain's father and grandfather out of sight ahead of the President's trip. ### ""A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President's visit,"" Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, chief of Navy information, said in a statement. ""There were also no intentional efforts to explicitly exclude Sailors assigned to USS John S. McCain."" ### Brown added that the Navy is ""fully cooperating with the review of this matter tasked by"" acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. ### Two Navy officials told CNN on Wednesday that the White House Military Office had asked lower-level US Navy officials about keeping the ship out of view -- an impractical request as the ship was under repair, one of the officials said. ### ""Once leadership heard about it, they said knock it off,"" a senior Navy official told CNN. ### The ship ultimately was not moved nor was the name obscured, said Cmdr. Clay Doss, a spokesman for the 7th Fleet. ### Trump told reporters Thursday that while he had had no knowledge of the plan nor would he have acted on it, he ""is not a big fan"" of McCain, and whoever was behind the plan was ""well-meaning."" ### When asked abut the controversy Friday, Shanahan maintained that the military would not be politicized, adding that he would not have directed the ship to be moved. ### ""Our business is to run military operations and not to become politicized,"" Shanahan told reporters at a Singapore news conference.

79365,"After making the choice to stay alive, amputees find solace in each other ### By Anita Butcher ### Posted June 02, 2019 07:30:00 ### A split second decision to have his leg amputated changed Peter Allen's life forever. ### Key points: ### Support group Limbs 4 Life is visiting regional areas in South Australia to create a social support network for amputees ### Researchers say support groups can dramatically drop feelings of isolation for people living in regional areas ### Keran Villis says becoming a peer support worker for Limbs 4 Life helped her own recovery as much as it helped her clients ### The diabetic fought an infection in his foot for about three years, until it became a losing battle in January 2018, when he was flown to Adelaide from his Port Augusta home in regional South Australia. ### ""As the doors of the ambulance opened, they were actually waiting for me and I thought, 'I'm in trouble',"" Mr Allen said. ### ""[A surgeon] said, 'I'm going to have to amputate your leg' — I knew this would probably happen, it wasn't a complete shock, but it was one of those moments in your life you do remember and I said, 'Do I have a choice?'"" ### Mr Allen was told he could live for up to five days if he didn't get the amputation done. ### ""I said, 'Is your saw sharp?' She said, 'It's surgically sharp'. I said, 'Go for it'."" ### Rehabilitation was a long process and there was uncertainty around whether he would ever walk again. ### ""I always remember the first time I tried this prosthesis on, and they got me to stand up in the wheelchair, and the feeling of excitement, I could actually stand,"" Mr Allen said. ### Although Mr Allen had the support of his son and assistance from medical professionals, he still felt isolated in his hometown. ### It was not until April this year, that he shared his experiences and spoke with other amputees for the first time at a Limbs 4 Life gathering in Whyalla, about 80 kilometres away. ### This was one of the first sessions the national organisation had held in regional South Australia, with the aim of creating a social support network for amputees living in the area. ### Limbs 4 Life has since travelled to other regions in the state including Port Lincoln, the Riverland and Port Pirie, with plans to set up groups in Mount Gambier and the Barossa Valley. ### Life after surgery ### Dr Sandy Braaf, a research fellow at Monash University who has done work into rehabilitation and recovery for people dealing with traumatic injuries, said peer support groups and social support were vital in helping injured people, particularly those living in rural and regional areas. ### ""There is no doubt that component of their recovery is as equally as important as their physical recovery,"" Dr Braaf said ### In the study she helped conduct, there were massive reductions in feelings of isolation when social support processes were in place. ### ""A lot of people spoke about how their injury or accident had actually changed who they were … and that peer support seemed to fulfil a need in those changes they've undergone."" ### Social connections key to recovery ### Becoming a peer support worker for Limbs 4 Life helped Keran Villis in her recovery as much as it helped her clients. ### The Riverland resident had her leg and part of her hip removed due to a terminal diagnosis of bone cancer in November 2014. ### Photo: After fighting for her life and surviving cancer, Keran Villis had to learn to live without her leg and hip. (ABC Riverland: Anita Butcher) ### Chemotherapy made her very weak and rehabilitation was a difficult process, but she was determined to get out of hospital and be home for Christmas. ### ""That was my aim, to get home and be able to cook, do the dishes, just do all those mundane things — to feel like you're worthwhile, to feel like you're still a mum,"" she said. ### After fighting for her life and surviving cancer, Ms Villis had to learn to live without her leg and hip. ### ""Just mentally, I'm pretty independent and strong minded, so I just wanted to be able to do most things myself, I didn't want to be reliant on others or my kids … [we're] a bit limited on services up here as it is."" ### After connecting with Limbs 4 Life, Ms Villis was encouraged to share her story with other amputees. ### ""It's been good for me to actually meet other people — I've even met somebody in a similar circumstance to myself now which is quite rare, because it's not a common amputation,"" she said. ### ""[It's] empowering to gain knowledge and to know that you're not actually on your own, and that we can help someone else."" ### Kylie Franson, who is the organisation's Peer Support Program Coordinator and born with a congenital upper limb difference, said it made a ""world of difference to meet somebody else who can say they've actually been through that"". ### ""And to be able to share just little hints and tips on living as an amputee, or maybe accessing services. ### ""If you can see other amputees who are perhaps a little further down the track … that can give hope to people.""",60119,1,"Chemotherapy made her very weak and rehabilitation was a difficult process, but she was determined to get out of hospital and be home for Christmas.###"" That was my aim, to get home and be able to cook, do the dishes, just do all those mundane things — to feel like you're worthwhile, to feel like you're still a mum,"" she said.###After fighting for her life and surviving cancer, Ms Villis had to learn to live without her leg and hip.###"" Just mentally, I'm pretty independent and strong minded, so I just wanted to be able to do most things myself , I didn't want to be reliant on others or my kids … [we're] a bit limited on services up here as it is.
