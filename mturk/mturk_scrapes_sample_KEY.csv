From 1942 to 1945 more than 2 million American military personnel were stationed in the U.K., and across the country people still commemorate their sacrifice. Britain is dotted with memorials, many built and still tended by local people who honor those who died and remember the thousands of others they drank and danced and fought with. Matt Dunham AP Photo ### TOPCROFT, England ### David Woodrow, 95, raises the American flag beside a memorial on his farm in eastern England every morning, weather permitting. ### He makes sure that memorial is tip-top, too. Dedicated to the U.S. Army Air Force's 93rd Bombardment Group (Heavy), it is surrounded by irises and geraniums Woodrow planted himself. The grass is trimmed to the millimeter. The granite gleams. ### ""There's one thing for certain: If Americans hadn't come over here and went to Normandy with us in '44 and the Germans had pushed us back into the sea, we couldn't have gone back again for another two or three years,"" Woodrow, a D-Day veteran himself, said when asked why he put it there. ""By that time, Germany would have had the bomb first and they would have won the war. They would have won the war then — if Normandy had failed."" ### As the wartime allies prepare to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, people around Britain are also remembering the Americans who paved the way for the invasion, including sailors who helped keep supplies flowing across the North Atlantic and air crews that flew bombing missions over occupied Europe. ### Unlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month ### Get full access to Centre Daily Times content across all your devices. ### SAVE NOW ### From 1942 to 1945, more than 2 million U.S. military personnel were stationed in Britain. People across the country still commemorate that friendly invasion, which bolstered the nation's defenses and gave many their first taste of America. From Portpatrick on the west coast of Scotland, where a plaque marks the site of a plane crash that killed 22 American airmen, to the Norfolk farm where Woodrow raises Old Glory, Britain is dotted with memorials to U.S. servicemen. ### Some are formal affairs funded by public money, like the Cambridge American Cemetery, which houses the remains of 3,811 war dead, and the American Air Museum a few miles away, where the silhouettes of 7,031 lost aircraft are etched into a curving wall of glass. ### But most are impromptu shrines built and tended by local people to honor those who died and to remember the thousands of others they drank and danced and fought with. ### There was no government master plan to make this happen. The memorials just sprang up organically, particularly in southeastern England, where most of the U.S. air bases were located because of the proximity to occupied Europe. ### Volunteers look after memorials in village squares, on corners of former airfields, at crash sites. Museums have been placed in former control towers. World War II memorabilia collections are preserved in pubs. ### One of these personal monuments made headlines earlier this year, when 82-year-old Tony Foulds persuaded the U.S. Air Force to stage a fly-past to honor 10 American airmen who died in a crash in the northern city of Sheffield in 1944. Foulds, who believes the pilot saved his life by steering away from a field where he was playing with other children, has tended a memorial to the airmen since 1969. ### Thousands rose at dawn in February to gaze at the fly-past. ### No surprise there, said Briton Mike Warner, who serves as informal liaison between the U.S. Air Force and local communities. ### ""These individuals fought alongside our own forces,"" he said. ### One place that decided to pay tribute is Redlingfield, a village 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of London, which built a black granite memorial to 2nd Lt. Kenneth Rongstad and the crew of a B-17 bomber that crashed into a farmhouse on Nov. 19, 1943. ### Janet Norman-Philips, 66, and other locals make sure it is scrubbed and bordered with bright pansies. ### ""People wanted to remember them,"" said Norman-Philips, who worked with American veterans to erect the monument. ""They were adopted, almost."" ### There's a reason the Americans made such an impression. Tiny rural communities, some with no running water, electricity or indoor plumbing, woke up to find construction crews pouring concrete on the flat farmland within striking distance of occupied Europe. Little Redlingfield soon had 3,000 servicemen from the Eighth Air Force as neighbors. ### The Americans brought not just bombers but stuff the locals couldn't get their hands on after years of war, like clothing, tinned fruit and candy. Local girls danced to swing music with American servicemen and the bases held Christmas parties for local children. ### It wasn't all songs and roses, though. The British were shocked by segregation in the U.S. military, and American manners — or the lack of them — sometimes clashed with the more traditional local culture. ### But once they got over the shock, the Brits and the Americans generally got along. ### James Clarey became fascinated with the story of the Americans in England as a teenager, when he found an airman's ID bracelet at a crash site near his home. He began collecting artifacts and eventually set up the 453rd Bomb Group Museum and 8th Air Force Heritage Gallery at the Old Buckenham Airfield. ### It's the sort of place where a pilot can still land a small plane, park it on the grass and sit on picnic tables out front of the cafe. Actor Jimmy Stewart was stationed here during the war, as was Walter Matthau. ### Here, surrounded by memorabilia and personal stories, one is reminded of the sheer poignancy of this D-Day, because the people who were there, the living links to a horrific conflict, are slipping away. ### ""This is kind of the twilight years for them,"" Clarey said. ""You must remember what these people did 75 years ago."" ### Woodrow, who served in the Royal Air Force during the war, landed at Normandy to scout out locations for landing zones in northern France. Soon after leaving the RAF in the early 1950s, he bought the Hardwick Airfield and built his farm on it. The sergeant's mess now houses his pigs and other wartime buildings hold a greenhouse and community hall. ### Veterans of the 93rd started trickling past in the 1960s, anxious to revisit the place they had served. By the 1970s, the flow of unannounced visitors had become a steady stream, but Woodrow always invited them in. ### When the memorial was dedicated in 1987, some 500 people came from the United States. There was, of course, a big party afterward. ### One of Woodrow's proudest possessions is a plaque that the bombers' group gave him in 1995 ""in gratitude"" to him and his wife, Jean, for providing the staging post for men who wanted to remember. ### Fewer veterans visit the memorial these days. There aren't many left. But their children do, and their grandchildren as well. ### Woodrow and his family still do what they have always done for the Americans: They open the door and say ""Welcome!""",60119,1,""" This is kind of the twilight years for them,"" Clarey said.

But he said that would be possible only if the Census asked every household about its members' immigration status for the first time since 1950. ### The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on that question as early as next month. But Republicans who support adding the citizenship question have rarely acknowledged any partisan political motive. The emergence of the documents now could figure heavily in the case the court is considering. ### To civil liberties lawyers suing to block the question, it's now clear that partisan politics were at work all along. They assert in court filings that Hofeller not only laid out the political benefit for the GOP but also ghost-wrote a U.S. Department of Justice letter calling on the Census Bureau to add an immigration question to next year's survey. ### The Justice Department denied the allegations in a statement on Thursday, saying Hofeller's Texas analysis ""played no role in the Department's December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census."" In that 2017 letter, Justice said it needed citizenship information to protect the voting rights of minorities. ### The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the citizenship question in April and is expected to rule by July whether it will be allowed. ### ""What it would result in is outrageously overpopulated and underpopulated districts,"" said Matt Angle, a Democratic redistricting strategist, adding that the resulting maps would harm Texas' booming Hispanic population with the aim of benefiting Republicans. ### Many of the state's top Republicans, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , have publicly expressed support for a citizenship question on the Census. On Friday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's office did not respond to questions about whether he would endorse using citizenship data to draw new maps, although a spokeswoman said last year that the Census question would provide greater transparency and was dismissive of fears of under-reporting. ### Opponents contend that many noncitizens and their relatives will shy away from being counted, fearing that law enforcement will be told of individuals' citizenship status. That could cause undercounts in places with large Latino populations, including parts of Texas, California, Florida and Arizona, and could cost them seats in Congress as well as federal funding. ### But the political impact of the citizenship question could go beyond an undercount if states use citizenship information to draw the maps for state legislative districts. The concept was introduced in legislation over the last few years in Missouri and Nebraska, where the state constitution already calls for excluding ""aliens"" from its apportionment. And Alabama has sued the federal government saying it should supply citizenship information. ### In Texas, Hofeller calculated in his report that about a half-dozen Latino-dominated districts would disappear, including a portion of one in the Dallas area, up to two in Houston's Harris County and two or three in the border counties of South Texas. ""A switch to the use of citizen voting age population as the redistricting population base for redistricting would be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,"" he wrote. ### There's a question of whether the switch would be legal. ### The U.S. Constitution specifies that congressional districts should be based on how many people — not citizens — live there. But it's murkier for many state legislative districts. ### The case at the heart of Hofeller's 2015 report was brought by Texas voters who contended it was unfair that noncitizens and minors were counted in making legislative districts because it gave a bigger voice to a smaller number of eligible voters in places with a lot of noncitizens and children. In response, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that states could not be forced to use voting-age citizens as the basis for districting. ### Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with that decision but wrote a separate opinion that seems to invite states to do it on their own. ""It instead leaves states significant leeway in apportioning their own districts to equalize total population, to equalize eligible voters, or to promote any other principle consistent with a republican form of government,"" Thomas wrote. ### If a state tried to use a limited population count for redistricting, a lawsuit would be likely. ### ""They're always trying to argue that only citizens should be counted for drawing the lines. They think it's to their advantage,"" said Luis Vera, a San Antonio-based lawyer for the League of United Latin American Citizens who has spent decades in court with the state over redistricting battles and said he'd sue if Texas switched to citizen-based districts. ### Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said lawmakers may be reluctant to change which count is used for redistricting knowing they'd face legal challenges. ### He said that even if a switch could be approved under a state constitution, it could run afoul of the federal Voting Rights Act, which bars state and local governments from restricting equal voting access based on race. ### But Rogelio Sáenz, a sociologist at the University of Texas-San Antonio, said he expects it will be considered in Texas, where Democrats picked up 12 seats in the House last year, now giving them 67 of the 150. ### ""The Republican Party is really anxious to gain back those few seats they lost in the last election,"" Sáenz said. ### ———",60119,1,"To civil liberties lawyers suing to block the question, it's now clear that partisan politics were at work all along.

Lilienthal, 40, of Longview has been in the Lewis County Jail since his arrest on April 19 pending resolution of charges of possession of methamphetamine. ### According to Washington State Patrol incident reports obtained by The Centralia Chronicle through a public records request, at about 6 a.m. April 19, a trooper on patrol in Lewis County clocked a northbound 1993 Honda Accord traveling 18 mph over the speed limit on Interstate 5. ### The vehicle’s tabs were expired, and the Honda was traveling erratically — as though the driver were “attempting to hide something” — as it pulled over onto the shoulder after the trooper activated his lights and sirens, according to the report. ### The vehicle continued for another mile before getting off at exit 68, according to reports. ### Lilienthal, the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle, had a suspended license and said he bought the vehicle about five to six days earlier. ### A property/evidence report from WSP listed the owner of the vehicle as Brian D. Butts, a Kalama resident whom police have accused of shooting DeRosier and who himself died in a shootout with two Kelso officers the next day. ### “Washington State Patrol communications also advised me that the vehicle was linked to the Deputy involved shooting in Cowlitz County on Saturday April 13th 2019,” the trooper wrote in the report. ### Another responding trooper wrote: “(A WSP sergeant) … was in contact with detectives that were investigating the murder and they requested that we search the vehicle for a .40 caliber magazine that was an item of interest in the investigation.” ### × ### {{featured_button_text}} ### Lilienthal, who had been promptly arrested for driving on a suspended license, consented to a search of the vehicle. ### “On the driver’s floorboard of the vehicle I located 2 large white crystals that I believed to be methamphetamine. Then I located another crystal under the driver’s seat along with a glass meth pipe that was wrapped in a small towel. No other contraband was located,” reads the report. ### One of the troopers noted a spilled smoothie in the car, and expressed belief that Lilienthal — who allegedly said to the trooper that he used to use meth — was trying to hide the meth crystals in the smoothie before being pulled over. ### Lilienthal, during a preliminary hearing in Lewis County Superior Court on April 22, said he had worked with Butts. ### “I didn’t know that Brian Butts was the kind of person that he is. I only worked with him. I didn’t know he shot an officer. I didn’t know that he was living that kind of life. I just bought the car from him,” Lilienthal said to Judge R.W. Buzzard during the hearing. ### He insisted he didn’t know there were drugs in the car, adding that despite his criminal history and multiple warrants for failure to appear he has been staying out of trouble. ### “I know that I have a record that goes a ways back, but I’m not trying to live that life. I have a 16-month-old daughter that I’m trying to live right for. I didn’t know the things that were in that car,” he said. ### He was granted $20,000 bail on the drug charge and $5,000 bail for the suspended license charge, but is still in custody. ### On May 17, he pleaded guilty, and a sentencing hearing is set for June 12. ### Subscribe to Daily Headlines ### Sign up!  ### Love",60119,1,"“ I didn’t know that Brian Butts was the kind of person that he is.

But the mistake may be more common than you think, according to researchers who claimed surgeons don't always confess to their errors ### Studies have estimated one wrong side surgery per 100,000 procedures – but the academics suggested the rate may be closer to one in every 16,000. ### Dr Daniel Arnal, from the Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón, Madrid, Spain, led the research analysing incidents between 2007 and 2018. ### He said: 'The stark reality is due to the lack of reporting to incident databases, these figures most likely represent an underestimate of the true situation. ### RELATED ARTICLES ### Share this article ### Share ### 'However, the reporting of wrong side errors have led to substantial corrective measures to prevent their repetition in our hospitals.' ### Almost half of the incidents (48 per cent) occurred in orthopaedic surgery, operations on bones, joints, ligaments and muscles. ### Ophthalmology surgery – operations on the eye – was responsible for 28 per cent of all of the recorded wrong site errors. ### WHAT IS A NEVER EVENT? ### Never events represent a fraction of the 4.6 million surgical procedures carried out each year and only occur in one in 20,000 cases of surgery. ### They include operating on the wrong body parts, mixing up organs and leaving surgical tools inside patients. ### Such incident have even led to deaths, including that of Frank Hibbard, who had undergone cancer surgery in October 2001 at Luton and Dunstable Hospital. ### Bungling medics left an 8cm-long piece of gauze inside his pelvis, which triggered a soft tissue cancer and led to the lorry driver's death, aged just 69. ### In 2015, Britain was called out for being one of the worst offenders for leaving items inside patients by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. ### Most of the errors (45) involved anaesthetic being given on the wrong side of the body. Severe harm was caused on three occasions. ### The remaining 36 revolved around the surgical procedure itself, according to the study presented at the Euroanaesthesia Congress in Vienna. ### An analysis of how the mistakes happened revealed patients were to blame for around 20 per cent, and incorrect site marking responsible for 16 per cent. ### Surgeons were distracted in eight per cent of the cases, and rushing was to blame for around 17 per cent of the errors. ### The remaining were caused by medics not having a surgical safety checklist, or not using it correctly. ### Dr Arnal added: 'Our findings highlight the need for adequate training and appropriate use of surgical check-lists. ### 'While these serious wrong side events are extremely rare, our mission should be to drive them down to zero.' ### A never event is defined as a catastrophic hospital blunders deemed so serious that it should never take place, such as operating on the wrong body parts. ### To avoid such a blunder, health officials advocate the use of standardised patient wristbands and the World Health Organization's Surgical Safety Checklist. ### The WHO measure, introduced a decade ago, was launched as a tool to improve the safety of surgery and prevent unnecessary deaths. ### It helps medics ensure they don't operate on the wrong patient, perform the wrong procedure or operate on the wrong part of their body. ### The data was taken from incidents reported to SENSAR, the Spanish Safety Reporting System in Anaesthesia and Resuscitation. ### The database covers 100 predominantly large hospitals across Spain, including one sin the Canary Islands, Madrid and Barcelona.",60119,1,"Ophthalmology surgery – operations on the eye – was responsible for 28 per cent of all of the recorded wrong site errors.###WHAT IS A NEVER EVENT?###Never events represent a fraction of the 4.6 million surgical procedures carried out each year and only occur in one in 20,000 cases of surgery.###They include operating on the wrong body parts, mixing up organs and leaving surgical tools inside patients.###Such incident have even led to deaths, including that of Frank Hibbard, who had undergone cancer surgery in October 2001 at Luton and Dunstable Hospital.###Bungling medics left an 8cm-long piece of gauze inside his pelvis, which triggered a soft tissue cancer and led to the lorry driver's death, aged just 69.","[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]","<p>Ophthalmology surgery – operations on the eye – was responsible for 28 per cent of all of the recorded wrong site errors.</p><p>WHAT IS A NEVER EVENT?</p><p>Never events represent a fraction of the 4.6 million surgical procedures carried out each year and only occur in one in 20,000 cases of surgery.</p><p>They include operating on the wrong body parts, mixing up organs and leaving surgical tools inside patients.</p><p>Such incident have even led to deaths, including that of Frank Hibbard, who had undergone cancer surgery in October 2001 at Luton and Dunstable Hospital.</p><p>Bungling medics left an 8cm-long piece of gauze inside his pelvis, which triggered a soft tissue cancer and led to the lorry driver's death, aged just 69.</p>",31,Valid,1.0

(AP) - Alabama lawmakers ended the 2019 legislative session on Friday. Here’s a look at some of the proposals that passed and failed this year. ### WHAT WAS APPROVED: ### ___ ### GAS TAX ### Gov. Kay Ivey called lawmakers into special session to approve the gas tax increase to fund road and bridge construction. The 10-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase will be phased in over three years beginning with a six-cent increase on Sept. 1 ### ___ ### ABORTION BAN ### The ban makes it a felony to perform an abortion unless the mother’s life is in danger. It is anticipated that it will be blocked by the courts. A lawsuit has been filed challenging the ban. ### ___ ### THIRD GRADE READING ### The legislation will require third graders to meet reading benchmarks before moving to fourth grade. The bill also spells out initiatives, such as requiring regional reading specialists to work with struggling students, to boost test scores. ### __ ### STATE SCHOOL BOARD ### Alabama voters will decide next year whether they want to abolish the elected state school board and replace it with a nine-member commission. Members would be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Alabama Senate. ### ___ ### PAY RAISES FOR TEACHERS, OTHERS ### Teachers and other public school employees will receive a 4% pay raise. State employees will receive a 2% raise. Lawmakers also voted to raise the pay for correctional officers as the state faces a federal court order to add officers. ### ___ ### PAROLE BOARD OVERHAUL ### The bill makes multiple changes at the state parole board, including making a gubernatorial appointee who could be dismissed at will by the governor. The board currently hires the director. ### ___ ### EQUAL PAY ### The legislation prohibits businesses from paying workers less than employees of another race or sex for the same work unless there are reasons such as seniority, a merit system or productivity to account for the difference. ### ___ ### JAIL FOOD ### Alabama lawmakers voted to end a practice that allowed some sheriffs to pocket leftover jail food funds. The bill requires the food allowance to go into a separate account that can only be used for feeding prisoners. ### ___ ### CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE ### The measures would track how often prosecutors use civil actions to seize a person’s property for suspected criminal activity. State prosecutors agreed this year to track the forfeitures, but the legislation would mandate it. ### ___ ### MEDICAL MARIJUANA STUDY COMMISSION ### Lawmakers voted to create a medical marijuana commission that would make recommendations for legislation that lawmakers might consider in 2020. ### ___ ### BROADBAND ACCESS ### The governor signed into law two bills aimed at expanding broadband access. One bill expands an existing grant program for broadband providers in rural communities. Another allows electricity providers to use existing infrastructure to provide broadband services. ### ___ ### MARRIAGE LICENSES ### Marriage licenses would be replaced with a new form called a marriage certificate. The change comes after several probate judges stopped issuing marriage licenses so they don’t have to give them to gay couples. Judges wouldn’t have to sign the new forms before a wedding. ### ___ ### BACKSEAT SEATBELTS ### The measure would require a person to wear a seat belt in the backseat of a moving vehicle. The legislation is named for a Montgomery teen killed in a car crash. ### ___ ### ___ ### LOTTERY ### A proposal to start a state lottery cleared the Alabama Senate, but it did not get a vote in the House. ### ___ ### PERMITLESS CARRY ### A bill to allow a person to carry a concealed handgun without getting a special permit failed to win approval in a Senate committee. The bill was backed by gun rights groups but opposed by state sheriffs. ### ___ ### MARIJUANA DECRIMINALIZATION ### The bill would have made possession of small amounts of marijuana punishable by a fine instead of jail time. An Alabama Senate committee advanced the bill, but it did not get final approval. ### ___ ### MEDICAL MARIJUANA ### The Senate approved a bill that would allow people with certain medical conditions to purchase medical marijuana with a doctor’s approval. However, the measure stalled in the House. ### ___ ### PAYDAY LOAN ### The proposal would extend the time that people have to repay a payday loan to 30 days. The proposal was designed to give borrowers more opportunity to raise the funds needed to repay a loan. ### ___ ### MANDATORY KINDERGARTEN ### The proposal would have required student to attend kindergarten before starting first grade. Most students do attend kindergarten, but it is not mandatory. ### ___ ### ETHICS OVERHAUL ### A Senate committee shelved a proposal that would have done away with a ban on gifts to public officials but replaced it with a requirement to report everything that was given. ### ___",60119,1,"_ __###PAY RAISES FOR TEACHERS, OTHERS###Teachers and other public school employees will receive a 4% pay raise.

Kamala Harris' microphone during a Democratic presidential candidates forum in San Francisco on Saturday before being escorted from the stage. ### The California senator was discussing implementing her gender pay-gap plan at the MoveOn ""Big Ideas Forum"" when the protester ran onto the stage, took the microphone from her hand and began speaking to the crowd. Harris, meanwhile, quickly walked off the stage. ### Story Continued Below ### ""We're asking for a much bigger idea than..."" the protester said before his microphone was cut off and he was surrounded by event security then dragged from the stage. ### The protester, Aidan Cook, of the Direct Action Everywhere animal-rights group, was asking for Harris to ""support ordinary citizens rescuing animals rather than the factory farms that abuse animals, sicken local populations and repress whistleblowing activity,"" according to a press release by DAE. ### ""I live in Oakland and I'm one of Kamala Harris' constituents. I came to the MoveOn Big Ideas Forum today because there's one big idea that all of the 2020 presidential candidates are ignoring. Which is that is by raising and slaughtering billions of animals every year not only are we completely ... undermining our values as a nation of compassionate animal lovers but we are literally preparing to drive our society off a cliff. Animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of climate change,"" Cook told POLITICO. ### By CHRISTOPHER CADELAGO and CARLA MARINUCCI ### ""We've done everything we could to try to start this conversation through normal channels, we've reached out to all the campaigns, including Kamala's, we've reached out to MoveOn and pretty much have been completely ignored,"" Cook said when asked if taking the microphone from Harris' hand could be seen as threatening. ### As Cook was being taken off stage, a moderator said, ""Thank you so much sir, for your big idea, but we want to make sure that we are able to get through this. It's OK, folks, it's OK. People have their own big ideas."" ### After the incident, the crowd began to chant ""Kamala"" as the candidate walked back on. ### ""It's all good. It's all good. Don't worry,"" Harris told the crowd, before telling the moderator, ""You had a question I want to answer."" ### Harris' husband, Douglas Emhoff, who helped escort Cook offstage later tweeted that they ""are good."" ### Thx for all the kind notes.

46,49407,"Fred Mawer ### It's possible to take a Caribbean cruise any time of the year. That includes during the Atlantic hurricane season, which officially runs from June 1 to November 30. You might think it's best to cruise in another part of the world during those months. But it's not as clear-cut as that, and there are in fact some compelling reasons to cruise around the Caribbean islands during the summer and autumn. ### Weather outlook ### Hurricanes are statistically likeliest to hit the Caribbean between mid-August and mid-October, with September the peak for major storms – hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated a number of Caribbean islands in early and mid-September 2017. ### The chances of encountering, or having your travel plans disrupted by, a hurricane in June, July and November are far lower. However, throughout the summer and autumn the weather in the Caribbean is typically stickier and wetter than in the winter and spring months, though rain normally comes as short, heavy downpours rather than prolonged soggy periods. ### Evasive actions ### Cruise lines rely heavily on weather prediction and monitoring systems, and go to great lengths to re-route ships to avoid hurricanes. So even in the peak hurricane period, on a Caribbean cruise it is extremely unlikely you will come face to face with a big storm. A more likely scenario is your cruise being disrupted. For example, the itinerary may be changed at the last minute, so you end up missing ports or visiting different ones. ### Back up ### Particularly if you're cruising during the hurricane season, it's a good idea to take out specialist cruise insurance that should include compensation for missed ports due to bad weather. I'd also advocate buying a cruise as part of a fully-fledged package that includes flights and any hotel stays before or after the cruise. ### Puerto Rico is among the islands badly damaged by hurricanes in recent years Credit: Getty ### Then, should any element of your trip be disrupted by bad weather, you are financially covered and have back up for the whole holiday. Companies offering cruise packages include Virgin Holidays Cruises ( virginholidayscruises.co.uk ) and Trailfinders ( trailfinders.com/cruise) . ### Choice of cruises ### Most of the major, mainstream cruise lines offer Caribbean trips year round, including Carnival, Celebrity Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean International. You can sail on eastern, western (including Cuba) and southern Caribbean itineraries through the hurricane season. The most southerly Caribbean islands, such as the Dutch trio of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao, lie outside the so-called hurricane belt and have been rarely hit by major tropical storms, though to reach them you still need to traverse more northerly parts of the Caribbean region that are more commonly affected by hurricanes. ### All that said, in the summer and autumn the choice of Caribbean cruises is not nearly as broad as in the winter. P&O Cruises, Marella Cruises and Fred. Olsen, which are all oriented to British clientele, operate ships in the Caribbean only in the winter months – typically late October/November to March/April. The same is true of upmarket lines with smaller ships that often visit more off-the-beaten-track Caribbean ports, such as Azamara, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, Star Clippers, Seabourn, SeaDream Yacht Club, Silversea and Viking. ### You could head on a Western Caribbean cruise from Miami Credit: Getty ### There's also less choice of departure ports in the hurricane season. In winter, as well as taking a Caribbean cruise from Florida, there are various options for round-trip voyages from Caribbean islands to which you can fly direct from the UK. There's a big choice embarking from Barbados , and some sailings from Jamaica ( Montego Bay ) and Cuba ( Havana ). By contrast, in the summer and autumn months, from those islands there's just the odd sailing from Barbados, and that's it. (You can take cruises year round from San Juan, capital of the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, but that's not convenient for Britons as there are no direct flights there from the UK). ### Peaceful ports ### Less choice has a positive side too – fewer ships in port. I've taken a Caribbean cruise in August. Our stops included San Juan , St Maarten and St Thomas. These are among the busiest cruise-ship ports in the Caribbean, where on some days in the peak winter months multiple ships can be docked at the same time, with beaches and sights overrun with many thousands of cruise-ship passengers. On our trip we were the only ship in port at all six islands we visited. It really made a significant, positive difference to our overall enjoyment of the cruise. ### Deals ### Caribbean cruises can be markedly cheaper in the hurricane season, particularly in the riskiest months. For example, for a week-long Western Caribbean cruise from Miami with Norwegian ( ncl.com ), I'm looking at quotes of from £529 in early September, compared with from £739 in February, travelling on similar-standard ships. And for a seven-night Eastern Caribbean cruise from Miami on Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas ( royalcaribbean.co.uk ), I was quoted from £747 in September, compared with from £909 in February. Fares are cruise-only, based on two sharing an interior cabin. ### Some voyages sail from Cuba Credit: Getty ### Good deals are usually less common in July and August, because demand is high in the school holidays; transatlantic airfares also spike in those months. But also note that on a cruise-and-stay arrangement you're also going to benefit from much lower hotel rates – whether in Florida or the Caribbean – in the low-season summer and autumn months than in the peak-season winter period.
